Overdose deaths related to synthetic opioids have increased six-fold over the past 20 years. Repeated opioid
users, such as individuals suffering from substance use disorder, are at the greatest risk for opioid induced
respiratory depression, the hallmark of overdose. Although extensive understanding into the cellular, circuit and
pharmacological basis by which opioids suppress breathing exists, how repeated opioid use impacts the control
of breathing has been largely understudied. This is despite the clinical and laboratory evidence indicating that
repeated opioid use significantly changes the control of breathing. This knowledge gap contributes to the limited
ability to address opioid overdose among repeat opioid users—the population most vulnerable to overdose
death. Even among repeat opioid users, tolerance to opioid induced respiratory depression can be labile. It is
well-recognized that tolerance to the analgesic and euphoric effects of opioids has context-dependence.
Similarly, the susceptibility to opioid overdose can be influenced by the context in which these drugs are used.
Yet, the contribution of context-dependent mechanisms to the susceptibility of opioid induced respiratory
depression is unknown. We developed a model of repeated fentanyl use that produces changes in breathing
consistent with the breathing phenotype observed in repeated opioid users—including a form of tolerance
dependent on context. The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the mechanisms involved with
repeated opioid use-dependent remodeling in the control of breathing. We hypothesize that repeated opioid use
remodels the control of breathing through direct cellular changes in the respiratory network and through the
emergence of a labile form of tolerance dependent on behavioral conditioning and neuromodulation within the
respiratory network. This work will examine: (1) the cellular and the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie
the remodeling of the control of breathing after repeated opioid use; (2) the contribution that learned behavior
has in producing state-dependent breathing and influencing opioid susceptibility; and (3) the role that
neuromodulation plays in influencing the stability of inspiratory drive prior to and after repeated opioid use. Thus,
this work provides a much-needed mechanistic framework for understanding how repeated opioid use remodels
the control of breathing. Such a framework can serve as a foundation for novel approaches and therapies to
address the risk of opioid overdose in individuals most vulnerable to overdose-death and respiratory-associated
co-morbidities."

Immune cells will serve as next-generation vehicles to deliver cargo such as bioactive drugs and contrast agents
to inflamed tissues. Due to their abundant expression of chemokine receptors, cells like macrophages have the
capacity to infiltrate inflamed tissues with remarkable specificity. Researchers are exploiting this capability to
direct the transport of attached nanoparticles containing drugs and other cargo to diseased tissues (e.g., from
cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease). However, macrophages are
living entities that can change their function in complex and sometimes unexpected ways when loaded with
nanoparticles. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the interactions between macrophages and the
nanoparticles they carry. To address this gap in knowledge, my laboratory will investigate two focus areas. First,
we will study how the physical properties of nanoparticles affect macrophage phenotypes. Using nanofabrication,
we will create nanoparticles that vary in size, shape, stiffness, and composition; direct their attachment onto, or
internalization within, macrophages; and measure their responses using epigenomic, transcriptomic, and
molecular phenotyping tools. This focus area will reveal differentially expressed genes that are involved in the
macrophage responses to nanoparticle loadings of various design. In the second focus area, we will study the
principal factors that govern cell-mediated transport of nanoparticles to inflamed tissues. Different macrophage-
nanoparticle complexes will be made and injected into mice harboring different models of inflammation designed
to recruit different subpopulations of immune cells. We will study the role of nanoparticle placement (i.e., onto
the surfaces of cells versus within their interiors) as well as the role of macrophage phenotypes on their transport
efficiency to inflamed tissues. The outcome of this work will be a set of design rules that predict macrophage-
mediated transport of nanoparticles to inflamed tissues. Once established, these rules will be exploited to guide
the design of new types of nanoparticles that interface with macrophages, promote specific phenotypes that are
advantageous for specific treatments, and facilitate improved transport to those diseased sites. Such a capability
will improve clinical efforts to use adoptively transferred macrophages to deliver drugs, vaccines, and contrast
agents for a range of inflammatory diseases."
10862741,"Stroke remains a significant human disease, and understanding the genetic factors that
contribute to its impact on specific individuals will ultimately be critical in targeting interventions.
Studies in human populations generally address factors affecting the risk of stroke occurrence.
Impacts on stroke severity are readily examined in experimental models, and parallel mapping
of vulnerability loci in mouse and human populations support the translational potential of such
analyses. We have recently identified marked divergence of stroke vulnerability among closely
related substrains of the C57BL/6 mouse. Smaller infarcts are seen in the J and ByJ substrains,
the latter of which originated early in the N lineage. In contrast, larger infarcts are observed in
subsequently derived NCrSlc, NCrl and NJ substrains. Preliminary results establish that the
larger infarct phenotype is inherited as a dominant trait, indicating a single causal mutation.
These nearly coisogenic substrain populations contain only a limited pool of segregating genetic
variants that could underlie the difference in stroke severity.
 We propose to identify the gene variant that modulates stroke vulnerability among C57BL/6
substrains. Aim 1 will generate comprehensive sequence data for ByJ, NCrSlc and NCrl
substrains, for which such resources are not yet available. Since ByJ and NCrSlc are the most
closely related substrains to differ in stroke vulnerability, this will define the minimum list of
candidate variants. Aim 2 will use high-coverage genomic sequences and a dense marker panel
already available for J and NJ substrains to map the locus impacting infarct volume in reciprocal
populations of JxNJ and NJxJ F2 intercross progeny subjected to permanent focal ischemia.
This locus will be confirmed using F2 crosses of ByJ and NCrl substrains. Aim 3, using CRISPR-
Cas9 methodology to repair each candidate variant, will establish the single genetic factor that is
the main source of variation in stroke vulnerability among C57BL/6 substrains."

Development of Fluorescent False Neurotransmitters
Monoamine neurotransmission plays important roles in modulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the
central nervous system and thus provides essential fine tuning of behavior in response to a changing
environment. Consequently, aberrations in monoamine neurotransmission underlie many neurological and
neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, depression, and drug
addiction. We have established an interdisciplinary research program focused on development of new
molecular probes to study monoamine neurotransmission on a synaptic level. Specifically, we have introduced
a conceptually new class of probes, termed “fluorescent false neurotransmitters” (FFNs), that act as optical
tracers of dopamine and norepinephrine. FFNs provide the first experimental means to image synaptic vesicle
content uptake and release at individual presynaptic varicosities in brain tissue and in living animals. Using
FFNs and multiphoton microscopy imaging we have made several unexpected findings, including the discovery
of silent dopaminergic and noradrenergic synapses, activity-dependent super-charging of synaptic vesicles,
and mechanistic insights on psychostimulant drugs. In this renewal application, we propose to expand the
scope of FFNs to serotonin synapses, the third major monoamine system, on the basis of proof-of-concept
studies. We will also develop new imaging and photon-counting methods based on the combinatorial use of
FFNs as presynaptic probes with emerging genetically encoded monoamine reporters as postsynaptic sensors
to provide multi-parameter synaptic readouts in living mice. In addition to complementing each FFN class with
the corresponding sensor (for example, dopamine FFN and dopamine sensor), mixing and matching FFNs and
sensors each for a different monoamine will enable simultaneous examination of two neurotransmitter
systems. This in turn will enable the study of complex processes such as co-transmission and neurotransmitter
switching on a synaptic level. We will also examine the effect of monoamine releasing agents on synaptic
neurotransmitter dynamics at the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin axonal release sites to probe both
the vesicular pools in active and silent varicosities and the mechanisms of action of these psychoactive drugs.
This application addresses a major unmet need in developing molecular tools and methods for imaging
multiple neurotransmitter systems in living animals with adequate spatial and temporal resolution."

In normal day-to-day life, the sense of urinary bladder fullness is conveyed to the central nervous system such
that voiding of urine is not too frequent, and retaining urine is not too painful. Much attention has focused on
attempting to treat urinary bladder dysfunctions however, to understand any disorder of the lower urinary tract
an essential physiological question must be addressed, and that is: How is bladder fullness sensed?
Amazingly, the basic physiological mechanisms for sensing bladder fullness remain elusive. Exploring this
fundamental question will be the focus of the current proposal, which should deepen our understanding of this
process, providing important insights into the fundamental mechanisms involved in translating bladder fullness
into afferent information. We propose the novel overarching concept that local changes in mechanical properties
of the urinary bladder wall during filling are what drives sensory outflow. Importantly, pressure, per se, does not
drive afferent nerve activity. Rather, it is the local deformation of the bladder wall that is the stimulus for afferent
nerve activity. During filling, local excitation of detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) spreads spatially to cause small
transient contractions of the bladder wall, called micromotions. Micromotions lead to angular distortions and
localized changes in wall tension of the bladder wall. It is this localized change in wall tension that we believe
triggers afferent nerve activity to sense bladder filling. This proposal gets at the heart of determining how fullness
is sensed in the urinary bladder, without speculating about cell types involved in signaling (urothelial cells,
interstitial cells, fibroblasts, etc). This project utilizes numerous novel techniques and approaches, such as our
pentaplanar reflected image macroscopy platform that enables real-time monitoring of micromotions on the entire
surface of the bladder. We have devleoped cutting edge imaging methodologies and signal processing
algorithms to quantify bladder motility and Ca2+ signaling dynamcis. In Aim 1, we will determine the basis for
local excitation of DSM during bladder filling. We will use imaging techniques on mice expessing genetically
encoded Ca2+ indicators to study how the excitatiliby of the DSM affects the spatial spread of Ca2+ signals. Aim
2 explores spatial-temporal relationships between excitation and the rate/extent of angular distortions, and
afferent nerve activity during filling. We will use simultaneous recordings of DSM Ca2+ activity, bladder pressure
and afferent nerve activity. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the basis for mechano-sensing by afferent nerves
in the urinary bladder and the role of Piezo1 and Piezo2 stretch-sensitive cation channels. Importantly, we will
characterize bladder function in Piezo2 knockout mice in vivo. Through completion of this project, we will gain
fundamental insights into the mechanisms whereby physical forces during filling are sensed by the urinary
bladder. Once we gain a full understanding of these processeses, we will be better suited to model, study, and
treat bladder dysfunctions."

A concrete way to map genotypes that cause Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance phenotypes is by
performing well thought out experimental genetic crosses between drug susceptible and resistant strains,
isolating recombinant progeny and then using quantitative trait loci mapping to link genotype to phenotype.
As an alternative, bulk segregant analysis under drug pressure can be used to pinpoint loci of interest. P.
falciparum genetic crosses were initially carried out in splenectomized chimpanzees, but NIH has banned
chimpanzee research for financial and ethical reasons. To overcome this, we have developed and improved
on a human-liver chimeric mouse model (the FRG NOD huHep mouse) to replace the chimpanzee for the
generation of recombinant progeny from P. falciparum genetic crosses.
The FRG NOD mouse lacks the fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase gene (F designation) and this causes
hepatocyte cell death. However, hepatocyte death is controlled with the drug nitisinone. Since only mouse
hepatocytes lack fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase, this enables repopulation of the mouse with human
hepatocytes over time with on-off drug use to control the death of mouse hepatocytes and their replacement
with human hepatocytes. In close collaboration with the Yecuris Corporation, who creates the FRG NOD
huHep mouse, we ensure that the mice we use for our studies have maximal human hepatocyte chimerism
and are susceptible to P. falciparum sporozoite infection. Additionally, the mice are able to maintain a human
red blood cell (huRBC) population after huRBC infusion and this allows for P. falciparum liver stage-to-blood
stage transition in the mouse. Following blood removal, the in vitro expansion of asexual P. falciparum blood
stages allows for bulk segregant analysis as well as downstream cloning and then –omics analyses and
phenotypic analyses of recombinant progeny.
We have clearly demonstrated our ability to use the FRG NOD huHep/huRBC mouse for the generation of
recombinant progeny from experimental crosses and Core A will continue to produce recombinant progeny
from a further ten well-conceived experimental genetic crosses between P. falciparum drug resistant and drug
susceptible strains as part of this P01 renewal. The phenotyping of bulk and isolated progeny supplied by
Core A and downstream mapping of genetic loci responsible for observed phenotypes are integral parts of
RP01, RP02 & RP03 and, as such, Core A is the linchpin of this P01 renewal. Successful creation of progeny
for this P01 will further our understanding of the spread of artemisinin drug resistance, which has now been
documented to have occurred independently in Africa and is of grave concern to malaria control and
elimination efforts."
10863150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Linkage mapping using genetic crosses results in identification of quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions
that may contain tens to hundreds of genes. Identification of the causative genes therefore requires
careful prioritization of candidate loci, followed by gene manipulation studies to validate the best
candidates, and ultimately to determine the causative mutations. Core B will play a critical role in this
program project, interfacing with RP01-03 for QTL location, candidate gene prioritization and candidate
validation phases of each project. Bulk segregant analysis for QTL location. In the first funding period,
we refined methods for rapid mapping of genes underlying QTL using Bulk Segregant Approaches
(BSA) that utilize deep sequencing of F2 progeny populations. Core B will sequence and analyze BSA
experiments conducted by RP01, RP02 and RP03 to determine the QTLs underlying traits of interest.
QTL mapping of P. falciparum typically maps reads to the 3D7 reference sequence, but this limits our
ability to localize QTLs to core genome regions. We will generate long-read (nanopore) reference
sequences for the parental parasites, which allows accurate mapping across the whole genome.
Candidate gene prioritization: Identifying the genes and mutations that underlie traits of interest is a
central issue in QTL mapping. Core B will develop and implement bioinformatic and experimental
approaches to prioritize candidate genes. We will utilize information from genomic analyses of P.
falciparum populations, computation predictions of SNP functionality, as well as information from P.
falciparum piggyBac mutagenesis libraries, and rodent malaria (P. berghei) knockout studies. We will
also utilize information from expression QTL (eQTL) analyses (RP03), and use nanopore long read
sequences to investigate structural variants that may underly phenotypes of interest. Candidate gene
validation: We will deploy systematic CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to determine the loci and specific
mutations underlying parasite phenotypes. This will initially use SNP editing to determine causative
mutations. We can also use conditional knockouts or conditional protein mislocalization (knock
sideways) strategies to examine the role of candidate resistance loci. Where haplotypes contain several
causative mutations, we will edit these individually or in combination to examine whether SNPs act
additively or epistatically to determine phenotype. These validation experiments will be conducted in
close collaboration with projects RP01, RP02 and RP03: Core B will generate the edited parasites,
while the projects will conduct the phenotyping experiments to examine links between phenotype and
genotype. These studies will (a) develop efficient computational and experimental approaches for rapid
identification of genes and causative mutations following QTL location (peaks to genes) and (b)
generate gene edited parasite lines, sequence data and bioinformatic tools that will be shared with the
community."
10863151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have pioneered a human-liver chimeric mouse model that supports Plasmodium falciparum liver stage
development and transition to blood stage infection and used this model in the first P01 to successfully
conduct more genetic crosses than have ever been achieved in the past and recovered hundreds of
recombinant progeny. This has been pivotal to map genetic traits regulating important parasite phenotypes
such as drug resistance. The biology of drug resistance is overwhelmingly studied in asexual blood stages
because it is at this stage that drug resistance is of clinical relevance. However, for drug resistant parasites
to spread through a human population, parasites must develop in a mosquito vector for onward transmission
to human hosts and spread in the human population. Upon human infection, parasites must then be able to
complete liver stage development and transition back to the blood stage infection to cause clinical disease
and for onward transmission. This is extremely relevant to the evolution and spread of drug resistance since
recombination could speed the acquisition and spread of resistance-associated genes in the field by
introgression of genes that (i) enhance transmission fitness and (ii) pre-erythrocytic infection fitness, into
drug-resistant parasite populations. This P01 Research Project will use genetic crosses to understand genetic
factors involved in parasite fitness across the mosquito stages and pre-erythrocytic stages of the life cycle.
We will determine if and how, after mating of two distinct parasite strains, particularly drug resistant and drug
sensitive strains, recombinant progeny utilize fitness advantages to outcompete parent strains. Using
distinctly fluorescent parental lines, we have already shown that both recombinant and parent oocysts are
readily formed in the mosquito midgut. We will thus determine if superior recombinant parasite fitness during
sporogony and/or sporozoite salivary gland colonization increases the success of human host infection and
identify the genetic loci that control these fitness traits. We have also shown that recombinant parasite
progeny can have enhanced fitness in human liver cell infection when compared to parent strains. We will
thus identify the genetic factors that determine sporozoite infection for human hepatocytes using parents and
recombinant parasites which show differences in levels of infectivity for human hepatocytes and differences
in successful establishment of the intra-hepatocytic replication niche. Finally, we will determine genetic factors
that enhance liver stage growth and duration of maturation into exo-erythrocytic merozoites and thereby give
a head start in initiating blood stage infection. This work will unravel factors controlling parasite fitness during
the mosquito stages and pre-erythrocytic stages of development and will show how these may enhance the
spread of drug resistant parasites."

After 40 years, a cure for people living with HIV (PLWH) remains both elusive and one of NIAID/NIH’s highest
priorities. Rebound-competent latent reservoir cells persist despite antiretroviral therapy and rekindle infection
due to the lack of efficient proviral silencing. The underlying hypothesis of the HIV Obstruction by Programmed
Epigenetics (HOPE) Collaboratory application is a novel “block-lock-excise” approach—that entails the long-term
durable silencing of viral expression towards permanent excision of the latent provirus—will lead to the
permanent control of the virus in the absence of therapy. A graded transformation of remnant HIV in PLWH is
proposed from latent into silent to permanently defective proviruses, thus emulating and accelerating the natural
path that human endogenous retroviruses have taken in the human genome over millions of years. This
hypothesis was formulated on the basis of 30+ years of dedicated research by HOPE investigators into the
underlying mechanisms of HIV latency, lack of success to date with latency-reversing strategies, recent results
with Tat inhibitor didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA) and ELITE controllers showing that a successful ‘functional’ HIV
cure could arise if there is a deep silencing of reservoir virus, and the availability of advanced genome-
engineering technologies (Brec1 recombinase, peptide nucleic acids, CRISPR-base editors) for direct delivery
of the final coup de grace: excision of remnant virus for permanent cure. The central hypothesis will be tested in
three Research Focuses (RFs) and five central objectives shared between the three RFs. Specific Aim (RF) 1:
Define mechanistically the durable transcriptional silencing of HIV across all T- and myeloid cell subsets by
combinatorial targeting of key host and viral factors. Specific Aim (RF) 2: Develop and characterize next-
generation HIV silencing approaches in the control of HIV rebound. Specific Aim (RF) 3: Disable the silenced
HIV-1 provirus by targeted genome engineering. Objective 1: Determine the epigenetic architecture of the
integrated provirus at different integration sites that prevents permanent silencing of latent HIV. Objective 2:
Define, at the molecular level, cell types and epigenetic cell states that favor viral rebound. Objective 3: Identify
molecular functions of Tat and host factors that prevent permanent silencing. Objective 4: Learn from HERV
silencing and mutational decay in the human genome. Objective 5: Respond to community expectations around
‘functional’ and ‘classical’ cure approaches. The HOPE Collaboratory partnered with the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation to build a strong art-based community education program and with three primary industry leaders,
Amgen, Sangamo and Constellation, who will provide intellectual and materialistic support. We also engaged
with four clinical cohorts of PLWH for clinical sample analysis in the US, Brazil and Africa. Collectively, the
innovative science, renowned members, collaborative organizational structure and milestone- driven research
plan of the HOPE Collaboratory represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo and promises
a fundamental new approach to HIV Cure strategies."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global
healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and
clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed.
Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive
tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models
could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of
participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe.
Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from
primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we
aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal
AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk
scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is
to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised
of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence
increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research
at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award
(K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help
research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research
will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international
studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's
career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding
investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational
neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform
future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to
identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation
to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and
related neurodegenerative disorders.

Cytokine signaling is essential to the initiation of the immune response against microbial infection and cancer.
The immune system is composed of two mechanisms of defense defined as the innate and adaptive immune
systems, both of which critically rely on cytokine signaling to function. The innate immune system acts early
during an infection or cancer and includes the type I IFN response. The adaptive immune system becomes fully
active after approximately seven days. Although this response is delayed relative to the innate system, the time
is needed to mount a T-cell response that is potent and specific. Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma are
examples of cytokines that shape the response of the adaptive immune system. There are dozens of other
cytokine families that each play an important role in the immune system including hematopoiesis, inflammation,
apoptosis as well as many others. Understanding how cytokines signal, the genes they induce, and their
functions are critical to understanding human health and disease. Recent examples of engineered cytokines
demonstrate that tuning of cytokine signaling can drastically alter a cytokine’s response and may offer promising
new therapeutic approaches. In this proposal, we aim to use protein engineering technologies to fill the large
gaps in knowledge of cytokine signaling which may reveal new targets and approaches for therapeutic
intervention.
 The paradigm of cytokine signaling is that cytokines drive the dimerization of cytokine receptors. Janus
kinases (JAKs) are believed to be constitutively bound to the cytokine receptors. Upon receptor dimerization, the
JAKs cross phosphorylate each other as well as the receptors. Signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STATs) bind to the phosphorylated receptors, are then phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus
to elicit gene and functional responses. Recent tool development in our lab provides a streamlined approach to
characterize protein-protein interactions which occur intracellularly, challenge assumptions in the field, and
provide an opportunity to understand how every step in cytokine signaling contributes to cytokine signaling. We
aim to show how altering these interactions tune cytokine signaling and response gene and functional signature."
10830960,"Title: Dissecting FAK-regulated oncogenic signaling programs in ovarian cancer
High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) kills four of five women within sixty months. HGSOC is
genetically complex, which has slowed past preclinical model development. To this end, we have molecularly
characterized a new and in vivo evolved, aggressive, implantable, and syngeneic murine ovarian cancer model.
These cells display many spontaneous acquired copy number changes, including K-Ras, Myc, and FAK/PTK2
genes (herein termed KMF cells) among other striking similarities to HGSOC. FAK (focal adhesion kinase) is
a tyrosine kinase canonically supporting integrin signaling, motility and mechano-sensing. Our collective
approaches in HGSOC and KMF cells, including pharmacological inhibition, FAK knockout, FAK re-expression,
complementation, and bioinformatic analyses reveal that non-canonical adhesion-independent FAK signaling
sustains intrinsic resistance to platinum chemotherapy in part via b-catenin activation and the elevation of
transcription factors supporting stemness and DNA repair genes. FAK is activated in patient tumors surviving
chemotherapy and acquired platinum resistance can facilitate ovarian tumorsphere dependence on FAK for
growth. We identified a gene set associated with FAK expression and a subset linked to intrinsic FAK activity
in 3D organoid cell culture. Exogenous activated b-catenin expression was sufficient to rescue FAK loss or
inactivation phenotypes in 3D culture, but b-catenin did not promote FAK-null tumor growth in mice. Thus, FAK
selectively promotes oncogenic signaling in vivo and FAK senses the tumor microenvironment. Our proposal
will test the hypothesis that stress-induced FAK activation in tumorspheres surviving within a mouse peritoneal
environment triggers specific cellular reprogramming, fostering stem-like state of heightened oncogenicity. In
Aim-1, our unique gene-edited human and murine ovarian tumor systems will be used together with an inducible
FAK expression system to characterize FAK localization- and kinase-dependent signals driving malignancy. In
Aim-2, total and single cell RNA-seq will be performed on cells isolated from tumor-bearing mice to determine
FAK regulated targets in vivo. Combined single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq will determine how subpopulations
of cells are derived in response to time-dependent FAK activation and the interrelationship of gene markers in
cell subpopulations. In Aim-3, we will use molecular and immunohistochemical analyses of patient clinical trial
samples to identify and biomarkers associated with FAK inhibition and patient outcome. Our proposal
encompasses cell biology, advanced RNA sequencing, epigenome mapping as well as single cell sequencing
with bioinformatic clustering analysis. These approaches, together with the evaluation of clinical trial patient
samples, will identify a “FAK-dependent” cell biomarker gene signature that can be re-tested for significance

Project Summary / Abstract
The goal of the Washington University (WU) Paul Calabresi K12 Career Development Award (K12 program)
for Clinical Oncology is to provide didactic coursework, mentored research practicums and specialized career
development programs for clinician scientists possessing an MD, DO, PharmD, nurses with PhDs, or equivalent
degree. We propose the renewal of this K12 to continue training clinicians from diverse disciplines, including
medical oncology, surgical oncology, gynecological oncology, radiation oncology and pediatric oncology to
promote their career development as cancer researchers and to design and administer hypothesis-driven
pilot/Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III cancer therapeutic clinical trials. We are requesting five slots per year to
support eligible scholars for two to three-year appointments. To enhance our highly successful K12 program,
we propose the following:
Aim 1: Expand the workforce trained to design and execute rigorous oncologic clinical research. We
propose to fund five K12 scholar positions per year at WU over the next five years to train eligible applicants
from diverse disciplines focused on patient-oriented cancer research.
Aim 2: Optimize existing curricula, career development, short-term training, and mentored, hands-on
research experiences pertinent to clinical trials and patient oriented research. We expanded upon our
opportunities to offer training in four tracks: Cancer Genomics, Translational Medicine, Patient Centered
Outcomes Research, and Cancer Immunology and Cellular Therapy.
Aim 3: Continue to develop and enhance robust evaluation and tracking of K12 scholars, faculty,
mentors, curriculum, and training opportunities. We will monitor progress, demonstrate outcomes, and use
short- and long-term results to improve clinical oncology research training.
Successful completion of these aims will result in increased numbers of diverse, well-trained investigators who
lead hypothesis driven cancer clinical trials. By partnering with stakeholders early and throughout the
translational enterprise, they will disseminate and implement their research findings in real world practice to
advance rapid human health and health care improvements."

Substance use disorder (SUD), including use of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH) and its congeners,
is on the rise, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic era. There are no effective medications available for
psychostimulant SUD, likely because of the lack of thorough understanding of the complex neurobiology
underlying the disease. Noradrenergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic circuit plays a critical role in SUD.
AMPH inhibits norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) activity promoting its behavioral effects. NET, a principal
mediator of NE signaling, is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and protein-
protein interactions. These regulators of NET are impacted by psychostimulants, including amphetamine, in turn
impacting the stimulant and rewarding effects of these drugs. However, to date, post-translational modifications
have not been a focus of investigation in the SUD field. Our published studies over several years demonstrate
that the The258/Ser259 motif, a phospho-site in the NET, plays a pivotal role in regulating AMPH-evoked
behaviors. In this proposal, we explore this novel finding using cutting-edge techniques, including a
phosphorylation-defective NET-Thr258Ala/Ser259Ala mutant mouse model (NET-T258A/S259A), a viral-
mediated brain region-specific blockade of NET-T258/S259 phosphorylation, and recordings of extracellular NE
dynamics in vivo using high-speed chronoamperometry and microdialysis. With these new models and tailored
biochemical, neurochemical, and behavioral studies, the current proposal aims to fill critical gaps in our
understanding of the central role of NET phosphorylation in AMPH-evoked NE dynamics and animal behavior.
As a key mechanism, we have discovered that NET-T258A/S259A mice exhibit genotype- and sex-specific
alterations in AMPH sensitivity in addition to brain-region specific variations in NET function and expression.
Here, we will expand and test our overarching hypothesis that brain region-specific T258/S259-dependent NET
phosphorylation and regulation contributes to sex-specific AMPH-induced behaviors relevant to addiction and
reward. Aim 1 will investigate NET regulatory phenomena including NET phosphorylation and NET subcellular
distribution and protein-protein interactions in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens to determine the
relationship between T258A/S259A mutant-dependent dysfunction in AMPH-mediated NET regulation and in
AMPH-evoked behaviors. Aim 2 will evaluate brain-region specific roles of T258/S259-dependent NET regulation
in AMPH reward using adult DBH-Cre mice expressing the NET-T258/S259 motif in a NE-terminal specific
manner. Aim 3 will examine the impact of T258/S259-dependent NET phosphorylation and regulation on NE
dynamics (release and clearance as well as extracellular levels) modulated by AMPH in vivo. Outcomes from
proposed studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of SUD, open new avenues for examining
T258/S259-phosphorylation dependent NET regulation as an underlying mechanism of AMPH’s actions and
provide new molecular therapeutic intervention points."
10859412,"Project Summary / Abstract
Dynamic uterine fluid volume is essential for successful early pregnancy. Uterine fluid volume is the net result of
secretion and absorption, which are respectively promoted by ovarian estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4)
through the uterine epithelium. Dysregulated uterine fluid movement has been associated with impaired early
pregnancy, particularly in women with endometriosis undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization-em-
bryo transfer (IVF-ET) who often experience uterine fluid retention and implantation failure. Na+ and Cl- are the
dominant ions in the uterine fluid. Amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and cystic fibrosis trans-
membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) have been implicated in their movements across the uterine epithelial
cell membrane to generate osmotic gradients for facilitating fluid movement through the epithelial membrane
water channels, aquaporins (AQPs). Despite the essential roles of sex hormones and ion/water channels in
regulating dynamic uterine fluid movement during early pregnancy, the precise hormonal and ionic mechanisms
remains elusive. Our preliminary data in mouse models revealed inhibition of uterine fluid absorption by amiloride
on day 0.5 post-coitus (D0.5) but not D3.5, dynamic expression of genes for ion/water channels in D0.5 and D3.5
luminal epithelium (embryo implantation initiates ~D4.0 in mice) by mRNA-seq, and a novel function of E2-es-
trogen receptor α (ERα) in regulating uterine fluid absorption. In human models, we developed a microphysio-
logical system that enables a microfluidic co-culture of ovarian follicles and human endometrial (Endo) organoids
for engineering a female reproductive tract-on-a-chip (FRT-Chip), and our preliminary data showed the long-
term survival and 3D architecture of Endo organoids in vitro as well as the regulation of ENaC and CFTR by co-
cultured follicles. Herein, we formulate our central hypothesis that ERα and PR converge on hormonal and ionic
mechanisms to finely coordinate temporal uterine fluid absorption during early pregnancy, while dysregulation of
ion/water channels in eutopic endometriosis endometrium or under ovarian stimulation for IVF leads to disrupted
uterine fluid dynamics and impaired early pregnancy. There are two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use trans-
genic mouse models with ERα or PR deficiency in the uterine epithelium to determine in vivo functions and
regulatory mechanisms of selected Na+ channels, Cl- channels, and water channels in the uterine epithelium for
uterine fluid absorption during early pregnancy. In Aim 2, we will collect normal and endometriosis endometrium
biopsies from menstruating women and IVF-ET patients to compare ion/water channels in human endometrium
biopsies and perform a microfluidic co-culture of follicles and Endo organoids to engineer an FRT-Chip and
investigate mechanisms regulating human uterine fluid movement under physiological and pathological condi-
tions. The successful completion of these studies will generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of uterine fluid
movement. Identification of local uterine epithelial factors is a crucial first step for developing treatments to reg-
ulate uterine fluid movement, improve embryo implantation success, and reduce early pregnancy loss."
10831414,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This program has provided interdisciplinary postdoctoral training in research on intellectual and developmental
disabilities (IDD) since 1995, with an emphasis on social-affective, cognitive and communicative, and family
processes. We have enrolled and “graduated” 43 postdoctoral trainees and have 3 postdoctoral trainees
currently in the program. Of our 43 graduated trainees, 32 obtained faculty positions at universities across the
U.S. and nearly all others have obtained research-intensive positions in the field. The training program is
housed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Waisman Center, and is fully integrated into the
multidisciplinary and translational center training activities including through their NICHD-funded Intellectual
and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC), over 90 NIH research grants by faculty
investigators, and a thriving clinical program serving 2900 patients/yr. The overall goal of the training program
is to provide interdisciplinary biobehavioral and translational research training to foster the next generation of
IDD researchers. Our program is designed to provide trainees with a broad foundation of knowledge on IDD
(e.g., prevalence, etiology, and presentation), the impact of race/ethnicity, cultural, and socio-economic status
on issues pertaining to IDD, research ethics, how to conduct rigorous and replicable science, and professional
development related to obtaining research funding and competencies needed in leadership positions. In
addition, through intensive research mentorship by program faculty, our trainees learn the methodological and
analytic practices to develop their own independent lines of research. Finally, through the development of an
individual development plan, and ongoing feedback from program faculty, trainees establish specific and
measurable research and professional goals and a plan for achieving these goals during the two-years.
The training program has three Specific Aims: 1. To provide postdoctoral trainees with the knowledge base
and research methods to generate new knowledge about social-affective, cognitive and communicative, and
family components of IDD. 2. To provide broad training in which we expose trainees to various theoretical
perspectives, methodological approaches, substantive areas, developmental periods, and a translational
science perspective. 3. To provide trainees with a solid foundation in research ethics and professional
development necessary to launch their own independent careers carrying out research on IDD. Support for
this program will ensure that a next generation of scientists is equipped to advance research on IDD and
associated conditions through various theoretical perspectives, methodological approaches, substantive areas,
developmental periods, and a translational science/public health perspective."
10831415,"Project Summary
The main objective of this new application is to demonstrate that individuals with low practice effects on
measures of daily functioning repeated across one week are more likely to cognitively progress over
the following year. This project would also examine if practice effects on these performance-based
functional scales differ across the disease spectrum in late adulthood by comparing older individuals
who are cognitively intact to those with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease. In an
exploratory aim, the relationship between practice effects on these functional scales and various
biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., hippocampal volumes via MRI, amyloid deposition via PET,
APOE e4) will be studied. These findings would add to the supporting evidence of practice effects as a
marker of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response in normal aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment,
and dementing illnesses. However, it will extend our prior work by focusing on practice effects on
functional measures (whereas our prior work looked at practice effects on cognitive tests). By realizing
the aims of this pragmatic project, we would be able to offer more efficient screening of potential
participants for clinical trials, which would reduce participant burden and financial costs associated with
these trials. Practice effects could also be used to enrich trials with those more likely to progress and to
monitor treatment benefit as a proximal outcome measure. Practice effects also have considerable
clinical benefits for diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive disorders in late life. This project is consistent
with the mission of the National Institute on Aging.
Relevance. Current clinical trials in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease require
participants to progress/decline across the trial to accurately evaluate the experimental intervention.
Although existing biomarkers (e.g., tau and amyloid imaging) are being used to identify those most
likely to progress, these biomarkers are expensive and invasive. Cheaper, less invasive, and more
sensitive biomarkers are clearly needed to make these trials more efficient. We propose that practice
effects on performance-based functional measures might fill this important gap in the literature. In the
current pragmatic project, we expect to provide clinicians and researchers with a new tool (i.e., practice
effects on functional scales) for predicting cognitive decline in seniors with and without cognitive
impairments. We expect to provide supporting evidence to include practice effects in future clinical trials
in normal aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's disease."
10830584,"Project Summary/Abstract
Spatial organization and dynamics are the essential features of living systems. Visualizing compartmentalized
signaling dynamics is thus critical to understand biological processes. We focus on rational design of new
classes of signaling reporters that achieve large dynamic range, high brightness, fast kinetics and high spatial
resolution. These reporters are designed based on 1) new physical principles such as multivalent interaction-
driven protein phase separation forming intensely bright GFP droplets upon activation of kinases (the reporter
is named SPARK for Separation of Phases-based Activity Reporter of Kinase); 2) FlipGFP, a fluorogenic
protease reporter by flipping a beta-strand of GFP; 3) SURF (Split UnaG-based Reversible and Fluorogenic)
protein-protein interaction (PPI) reporter by splitting and engineering a new fluorescent protein scaffold UnaG
by structure-based design and directed evolution. Our primary goal in designing the new classes of signaling
reporters is to enable us in visualizing compartmentalized signaling dynamics in living systems, including PPIs
that determine specificity of signal transduction, and effectors such as kinases and proteases that regulate all
major signaling pathways. If we understand spatial organization and temporal dynamics of signaling, we will be
able to better understand molecular mechanisms of biological processes, laying the foundation for
understanding disease mechanisms and identifying drugs for the treatment of various diseases including
infectious diseases and cancer. While we have made considerable progress, in the next five years, we will
address three major unsolved issues: imaging endogenous PPIs, multicolor reporters of kinases and
proteases. We will engineer and demonstrate these multicolor and ultrasensitive reporters for multiplex
imaging of signaling network in living systems."
10831483,"Project Summary
Poor disease self-management is a significant issue in pediatric migraine as comprehensive treatment for
migraine includes pharmacological and biobehavioral interventions as well as consistent engagement in
healthy habits (i.e., adequate hydration, eating a healthy and balanced diet, regular exercise, and sufficient
sleep), and requires daily patient effort to ensure optimal outcomes. With the annual cost of nonadherence in
US health care exceeding $300 billion, self-management of chronic conditions is critical to reducing morbidity
and health care expenses. We have identified numerous factors that interfere with adolescents’ ability to
effectively self-manage including treatment burden, forgetting, catastrophizing, negative beliefs about
treatment efficacy, and lack of parental support/monitoring. Although these barriers are amenable to behavioral
intervention/CBT, many adolescents lack the self-management skills to overcome them on their own, and
clinic-based self-management efforts have proven inadequate. Through our intervention research, we have
demonstrated the efficacy of multicomponent self-management intervention and CBT for migraine treatment.
However, the proportion of the migraine population that could receive this type of treatment has been restricted
due to limited access (e.g., lack of available trained clinicians, distance between patient homes and treatment
facility). With funding from our recent R21 (NS094476) and in collaboration with key stakeholders (i.e.,
patients, parents, and clinicians), we have addressed these accessibility issues by iteratively developing the
first migraine-specific digital therapeutic self-management tool, Migraine Manager, which can be used by all
key users to address patient self-management needs. Patients receive algorithmically-derived individualized
intervention to meet their needs, and clinicians have access to patient data regarding their symptoms and self-
management intervention data that can be obtained prior to or in-between clinic visits. The proposed project
aims to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the effect of the Migraine Manager portal on
headache frequency, health-related quality of life, and migraine-related disability in 160 adolescents with
migraine compared to an attention control group. We will also test the sustainability of treatment effects
through examination of clinical endpoints at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up, as well as potential
mechanisms of observed treatment effects. This study will have a significant impact on public health by
providing greater access to an evidence-based resource to a large proportion of patients who otherwise would
not receive treatment, thereby reducing health care disparities for families that have limited access to services.
Given the health and economic impact of poor self-management in migraine, this study is timely and important,
as it has the potential to positively impact health outcomes in this population and serve as a model for self-
management intervention across pediatric populations."
10831485,"Project Summary: Most genetic variants associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
lie in non-coding gene regulatory elements (GRE; e.g., promoters and enhancers). GREs are tissue- and cell
type-specific and are identified through their epigenomic signatures, including low DNA methylation (DNAm),
DNA accessibility and certain histone modifications. The PsychENCODE Consortium has characterized brain
GREs across brain regions and developmental time points, as well as in the brains of psychiatric patients using
mostly DNA accessibility and histone modification marks. These marks, however, identify large regions of
enrichment (~300-2,000bp), providing only low resolution coverage of the important regulatory nucleotides, e.g.,
transcription factor binding sites. DNAm (especially cell type-specific DNAm) has received less attention,
although it has been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD).
 In the adult human brain, ~80% of CG and 1.5% of non-CG (CH) sites are methylated, and can be converted
to hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and further demethylated. In postmitotic neuronal genomes, mCH and hmC
accumulate to a significantly higher level than in other tissues--a distinct feature of the brain’s epigenome.
Bisulfite sequencing (BS)-based approaches that are used to measure (h)mC can pinpoint GREs with single
base resolution, presenting a unique opportunity to refine the gene regulatory landscape of the brain cell types.
 Here we aim to create reference DNAm maps [mC and hmC, using BS and oxidative (ox)BS sequencing]
and transcriptional profiles (using RNA-seq) in two major subtypes of neurons in the human dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), namely excitatory glutamatergic (Glu) and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons. The
proposed work is based on fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) methods that we recently developed
to separate nuclei of different cell types from autopsied human brain, and on our recent findings that showed
unexpected relationships between DNA(h)m, GREs, and gene expression in the DLPFC Glu and GABA neurons.
 We will perform these studies at key time points of postnatal brain development and adulthood to map
DNA(h)m within active neuron subtype-specific GREs that may be vulnerable to disruption during childhood and
adolescence periods that coincide with the critical processes of brain maturation and circuit refinement (Aim 1).
This work will be complemented with single nucleus mC profiling, which will allow us to define the developmental
trajectories of mC in discrete subpopulations of Glu and GABA neurons (Aim2).
 Finally, we will profile Glu and GABA neurons in 150 autopsied DLPFC samples obtained from controls and
cases of SZ and BD, and will then map neuron subtype-specific gene expression and (hydroxy)methylation
quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTLS, hmQTLs) (Aim3). We will integrate QTL, transcriptome, and DNA(h)m data
with the results of SZ and BP GWAS to reveal DNA(h)m and gene expression-mediated causal risk variants and
genes, and to distinguish specific neuronal subtype(s) that are critical in the etiology of these disorders."
10831486,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is part of Lewy body dementia, the 2nd-most-common degenerative
dementia in the U.S. It is also one of the Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRDs). Evidence-based
models of end-of-life care for ADRDs are insufficient; families face difficult medical decisions with little
information for guidance. This is particularly relevant for DLB, where >70% of individuals die of the dementia
itself or failure to thrive. Caregivers describe lack of knowledge of what to expect at the end of life as an
important driver of negative end-of-life experiences. The proposed study addresses this unmet need. It also
addresses the National Institute on Aging’s priority to improve quality of care and quality of life for persons with
ADRDs at the end of life and their caregivers. This study aims to (1) determine the predictors of death within 6
months in individuals with DLB, (2) identify whether a change in caregiver measures can predict approaching
end of life of individuals with DLB, and (3) identify factors that affect quality end of life experiences for persons
with DLB and their caregivers. These aims will be accomplished through a longitudinal cohort study enrolling
dyads of individuals with DLB of at least moderate dementia severity and their caregivers. Dyads will attend
study visits every 6 months through the end of life or 3 years. Based on published clinical series, over half of
enrolled individuals with DLB are expected to die over the course of the study. To achieve diverse recruitment,
the study includes an in-person cohort where dyads are recruited from Lewy Body Dementia Association
Research Centers of Excellence and a novel virtual cohort where dyads are recruited through the Lewy Body
Dementia Association and study visits are conducted by telephone. Having a virtual cohort will capture the
experiences of individuals with DLB and caregivers not receiving care at specialty centers. Because the
majority of study measures are caregiver-reported, the in-person and virtual groups have identical study
measures, except for the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, completed only in person. Collected
measures will include demographics, DLB characteristics (e.g. cognitive, motor, behavioral, sleep, and
autonomic symptoms), health care providers and settings, caregiver considerations (e.g. resilience, support,
grief, burden), quality of life (for the patient and caregiver), and satisfaction with end of life experiences. The
caregiver will complete a final study visit 3 months after the death of the person with DLB to assess grief,
recovery, and quality of the end of life experience. By following dyads through the end of life and death of the
person with DLB and the initial bereavement period for the caregiver, the study will identify DLB-specific
predictors of the last 6 months of life, changes in caregiver measures that identify the last 6 months of life, and
factors which influence quality end of life experiences. These results will inform the content and timing of end-
of-life counseling in DLB, help establish quality metrics for end of life care, and identify areas where
interventions could potentially improve end of life experiences for individuals with DLB and their caregivers."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are revolutionizing cancer care, producing durable anti-tumor responses in
multiple cancer types; however, by unleashing T-cell responses, ICIs can lead to immune-related toxicities in
essentially any organ system, affecting 60-80% of recipients. It is conservatively estimated that 3-5% of
patients develop acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) after ICIs, and a recent study found that up to 40% of patients
that survive 2 years after receiving ICIs will experience rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline
(>3mL/min/year). Very little is known about the mechanisms of ICI-induced kidney injury, as all prior published
work in the field has been descriptive. Building on published studies showing distinctly high cytotoxic T-cell
activity in immune-related adverse events after ICIs, we hypothesize that AIN and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) that result from ICIs exist on a spectrum of T-cell mediated injury to the tubulointerstitial compartment of
the kidney. In Aim 1, we will enroll 25 patients with biopsy-proved ICI-induced AIN (ICI-AIN) and 25 patients
with clinically-adjudicated hemodynamic AKI after ICIs and use single-cell RNA sequencing of paired kidney
biopsy tissue, blood, and urine specimens to uncover mechanisms of ICI-induced AIN. Single-cell
transcriptional profiling of kidney tissue will offer insights into the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of ICI-
AIN as well as a clear benchmark against which to compare blood and urine signatures (Aim 1B). We will then
compare cell-based transcriptional biomarkers (Aim 1C) and cytokine biomarkers (Aim 1D) in blood and urine
of patients with biopsy-proven ICI-AIN to hemodynamic AKI after ICIs to identify biomarkers unique for ICI-AIN
and pathways to target in future interventional studies. In Aim 2, we will determine the relationship between
ICIs and long-term kidney injury by prospectively evaluating blood and urine biomarkers of kidney injury over
two years in ICI-treated patients with melanoma compared to control patients with early-stage melanoma who
undergo surgical resection alone and do not receive ICIs (Aim 2A). To understand mechanisms promoting
kidney function decline after ICIs, in Aim 2B, we will use scRNAseq to investigate the similarities between
immune and non-immune cell transcriptional programs in blood and urine among patients with >20% eGFR
decline after ICIs to patients with ICI-AIN from Aim 1B. In aggregate, the studies proposed will uncover
mechanisms of ICI-induced kidney injury, have strong potential to lead to non-invasive diagnostics for ICI-AIN,
and yield important biological insights into the role of T-cell disinhibition on kidney function. The proposal will
capitalize on the expertise of the Severe Immunotherapy Complications Service at Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH), a first-of-its kind multidisciplinary team of oncologists and subspecialists studying immune-
related adverse events, and the tremendous biobanking infrastructure of the MGH Cancer Center, driving the

10885898,"An estimated 51,540 new oropharyngeal cancer cases and 10,030 deaths will occur in U.S. during 2018. Oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most challenging to treat human cancers due to the insidious nature of its early disease,
dependence on radical surgery for treatment and difficulty achieving locoregional control. Further, even OSCC patients
who are cured by surgery must face major esthetic and functional changes of their face and mouth. OSCC arises from
malignant transformation of its precursor lesion i.e. oral intraepithelial neoplasia (OIN). While not all OINs progress to
OSCC, up to 87% of high-risk lesions transform. Despite refined predictive parameters, we do not yet have the methodology
to predict which OIN lesions will progress to OSCC. Further, approximately a third of OIN lesions recur despite
microscopically clear surgical margins; findings which imply heritable defects in the keratinocyte stem cell pool. As
OSCC's devastating effects are well-recognized, numerous OSCC prevention trials have been conducted. The majority of
these studies employed systemic delivery and were largely ineffective. Systemic delivery limitations include drug
inactivation during first pass metabolism in the liver which results in difficulty achieving therapeutic levels of active drug
at the target site and adverse side effects. In contrast, local delivery formulations provide therapeutic levels directly to the
treatment site using appreciably less drug and without adverse side effects. The mouth's visible accessibility facilitates agent
placement by patients and clinical monitoring. Our lab has previously conducted a local delivery OSCC chemoprevention
trial and obtained strong results including complete OIN resolution in some patients. Not all patients derived
chemopreventive benefits which prompted development of a new local delivery formulation. The Specific Aims of this
proposal are: 1) identify the clinical lead patch formulation in vivo and characterize the metabolic profile of locally delivered
fenretinide (4-HPR), 2) confirm application time in healthy participants then evaluate chemopreventive efficacy in persons
with microscopically confirmed OIN lesions. Experimental methodology will include PK analyses, LC-MS, IHC and laser
capture microdissection followed by LOH analyses. The trial biomarkers (histologic grade, clinical presentation and LOH
events) are all associated with OIN progression. This formulation i.e. a 4-HPR patch is expected to provide more pervasive
chemopreventive effects across the trial cohort. Public Heath Relevance: Oral cancer, which arises from the cells lining
the inside of the mouth, is a devastating cancer that is managed by aggressive surgery. Even if cured by surgery, patients
live with swallowing, eating, talking difficulties and deformities to their face and mouth. Previous oral cancer prevention
programs, which used pills that could affect the entire body, were not successful and often caused adverse side effects
including very sore mouths and night blindness. In contrast, this project introduces a more efficient and safer approach i.e.
application of the cancer preventing agent directly to the precancerous tissue."
10842272,"Engaging in affiliative social interactions predicts health and longevity. The hormone oxytocin,
which is released by specialized neurons in the hypothalamus, has been shown to play an
important role in affiliative behaviors. However, the mechanisms that control activity of oxytocin
neurons and by which these neurons might then control engagement in social interactions, have
not yet been elucidated. Our long-term goal is to dissect the neuroendocrine mechanisms driving
voluntary engagement in affiliative social interactions. Our findings will facilitate the design of
therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing the widening loneliness pandemic, as well as ASD.
The objective of this grant is to characterize the role of oxytocin neuron activity patterns in
initiation and reinforcement of social interactions. The central hypothesis is that spiking activity
in oxytocinergic neural circuits plays a critical role in spontaneous and stress-induced social
engagement, and that activity in distinct oxytocinergic circuits specifically controls either initiation
or reinforcement of social engagement. In our specific aims we will use automated behavioral
analysis of video recordings of mice living together for days, behaviorally synchronized neuronal
recordings, optogenetics and chemogenetics to determine if neuronal activity of identified oxytocin
neurons predicts or tracks social interactions (AIM 1). We will use optogenetics and
chemogenetics to manipulate neuronal activity of specific oxytocinergic circuits to determine if
they are required for the initiation or reinforcement of affiliative interactions (AIM 2). We will test if
stressful contexts increase activity in specific oxytocinergic neurons to promote engagement in
affiliative social interactions, as a defensive mechanism (AIM 3). Our work will significantly
contribute to the field, as it will establish mechanisms that can be therapeutically targeted to
drive social engagement. The proposed research is innovative because we investigate activity
patterns in neuroendocrine circuits that predict spontaneously initiated and reinforced social
interactions, which has not been done before. Our results will lay the bases for novel behavioral
interventions and medications that could be used to prevent the negative effects of social
isolation."
10842389,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the interplay of epigenetics and developmental context in
driving pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG), universally lethal tumors defined by histone mutations, so as to
identify better targeted treatments. This work utilizes an innovative cerebral organoid-based model that allows
side-by-side comparison of oncohistone mutants and dynamic modulation of oncogene expression in a three-
dimensional human context. Leveraging this innovative model, Dr. Graham will use cutting-edge single cell
profiling techniques and preclinical glioma modeling to address unanswered questions that currently hamper
therapeutic development for these patients. In Aim 1, chromatin profiling and single cell RNA sequencing will
be used to investigate the distinct effects of two different oncohistones (H3.3K27M and H3.3G34V) during neural
development. In Aim 2, the timing and order of mutations will be manipulated to evaluate the impact of cellular
and mutational context on tumor phenotype. Finally, in Aim 3, orthogonal genetic “rescue” and pharmacologic
inhibition approaches will be used to interrogate the role of these mutations in tumor maintenance.
This work, as well as Dr. Graham's career goal, is well-aligned with the NINDS mission to seek basic
knowledge about the brain and to translate that knowledge into clinical impact. Through the proposed studies
and the accompanying career development plan, Dr. Graham will gain essential training in epigenetics,
bioinformatics and preclinical glioma studies, critical gaps in her current skillset. Dr. Graham is an Instructor of
Neuro-Oncology under the mentorship of Dr. Ingo Mellinghoff at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSK). Dr. Mellinghoff is a leader in translational glioma research with a strong track record of mentoring
trainees to independence. He and Dr. Graham have assembled an exceptional Advisory Committee with
expertise in chromatin biology, translational oncology, and bioinformatic analyses: Dr. Kristian Helin, Dr. Ross
Levine and Dr. Nicholas Socci. MSK provides an outstanding environment for cultivating budding careers in
biomedical research, with unparalleled resources, support, and opportunities for collaboration. Upon
completion of the proposed work, Dr. Graham will be ideally positioned and uniquely qualified for a career as
an independent investigator elucidating fundamental aspects of epigenetic regulation in neural lineage
commitment and applying her findings to address the unmet needs in the treatment of malignant glioma."

Opioid drugs are the most widely used analgesics, but also abused substances. The adverse actions of these
drugs, including peripheral side effects, dependence, tolerance and withdrawal, severely limit their utility for
long term pain management. The -opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary target of opioid analgesia, addiction
and withdrawal. Thus, efforts aimed at developing safer opioid treatments and managing problematic side
effects, such as addiction and withdrawal, require a much deeper understanding of the genetic and molecular
mechanisms that regulate MOR and the behavioral effects of opioid drugs.
 Our long-term goal is to use unbiased, large-scale forward genetics and proteomics, as well as
targeted biochemistry and pharmacology to understand how ubiquitin ligase signaling affects opioid sensitivity
and tolerance at a behavioral level. Towards this goal, we deploy a transgenic MOR (tgMOR) model, in which
mammalian MOR is expressed in the nervous system of C. elegans. This imbues C. elegans with opioid-
sensitive behaviors that we evaluate using computationally automated assays. Importantly, tgMOR animals
exhibit the behavioral hallmarks of opioid responses in higher organisms including acute depressant effects,
desensitization and tolerance. We previously used forward genetics and our tgMOR platform to unveil a novel,
conserved anti-opioid system that functions from C. elegans through rodent behavioral models. This approach
has now identified a ubiquitin ligase that regulates opioid sensitivity and behavioral tolerance to repeated
opioid exposure. Our proposal represents an unprecedented opportunity to decipher how ubiquitin ligase
signaling affects opioid drug responses on a behavioral genetic level.
 Our first aim will use two primary approaches to determine how this ubiquitin ligase shapes opioid
behavioral responses. 1) We will use unbiased, large-scale forward suppressor genetics combined with whole-
genome sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 editing to identify mutations that rescue abnormal opioid responses in
tgMOR ubiquitin ligase mutants. This will identify genes and genetic networks that are inhibited by ubiquitin
ligase activity to influence opioid responses. 2) We will deploy unbiased, large-scale targeted proteomics with
this ubiquitin ligase that will determine its interactome, binding proteins and putative substrates. Importantly,
this aim features two approaches that are unbiased and large-scale but also complementary. In the second
aim, we use in depth biochemical and structural studies to evaluate candidate substrates for this ubiquitin
ligase. Using orthologous human ubiquitin ligases provides an important translational component to our
proposal. We further aim to develop a high throughput screen (HTS) compatible assay for these human
ubiquitin ligases. Finally, we use this HTS compatible assays in a pilot screen for small molecule inhibitors of
these ubiquitin ligases. Our aims represent first of their kind studies on how ubiquitin ligase signaling affects
opioid responses using an innovative new whole animal behavioral model."
10842394,"Project Summary/Abstract
First language acquisition is a hallmark of typical human development. A substantial body of research suggests
that infants’ ability to detect statistical regularities in language input facilitates language learning. However, the
impact of this literature has been limited by its failure to connect statistical learning with the burgeoning body of
research and theories focused on infants’ real-time language processing. The current application is motivated
by the premise that statistical regularities facilitate infants’ attempts to efficiently encode and process language
input. To this end, infants generate predictions about likely downstream input. These predictions are often
incorrect, rendering prediction errors – a potentially potent source of data for subsequent learning. Input that is
probabilistic and/or that has previously led to prediction errors provides information-rich data, guiding infants’
subsequent attention and learning. We hypothesize that statistical regularities are an important source of
information influencing this process, along with the other contextual cues available in both the linguistic and
nonlinguistic environment. To date, no prior studies have manipulated statistical regularities during infant
language processing tasks; research is necessary to adjudicate amongst the possible relationships between
statistical regularities in the input and real-time language behaviors during development. In the proposed
experiments, we will measure infants’ use of sequential statistical regularities during predictive language
processing tasks (Aim 1), assess the impact of statistical regularities on prediction error-based learning (Aim 2),
and examine the role of uncertainty due to statistical structure and prediction error in motivating infants’ active
exploratory behavior during language learning (Aim 3). The results of the proposed research will promote
positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the relationship between the statistical
structure of language input and real-time processes that are unfolding during language development. As in our
previous statistical learning research, the outcomes of these studies with typically-developing infants will
motivate future investigations that include infants and young children at risk for atypical language development
trajectories."

10842346,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposed study is a step toward the career development goal of becoming an independent researcher who
focused on the study of the functional connectivity alterations among opioid users. The opioid overdose results
in almost 450,000 deaths during 1999-2018, and 128 people in the United States die every day from the opioid
overdose in 2018. Abuse of prescription opioids is likely due to factors that affect the mesolimbic and cortico-
striatal system in the brain, including alteration of dopamine release and loss of cognitive control. Recent
preclinical work has shown that higher input from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to the dorsal striatum is
associated with compulsive reward-seeking behavior despite negative effects (e.g., punishment). At present, it
remains unknown whether opioid use is associated with the functional connectivity alterations between the OFC
and dorsal striatum in humans.
The gold standard to characterize the functional connectivity is to pair brain stimulation with neuroimaging.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-approved brain stimulation for depression,
which is also being pursued as a treatment for opioid use disorder. TMS can be paired with fMRI in concurrent
TMS-fMRI experiments to characterize causal manipulations of functional neural circuits. The overarching goal
of this application is to use the novel method, concurrent TMS-fMRI, to investigate whether opioid use is
associated with the functional connectivity alterations between the mesolimbic and cortico-striatal system in
human. I will characterize functional connectivity between the OFC, dorsal striatum, and habenula in both healthy
subjects and opioid users (Aim 1). I will then evaluate brain response to the repetitive TMS (rTMS) treatment in
opioid users (Aim 2). The results from this proposal will yield a significant step forward in developing the neural-
circuit based strategies as treatments for opioid use disorder.
The candidate is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry. This application
will provide multidisciplinary training for the candidate to learn the needed skills: (1) learn the neurobiological
basis of addiction, and learn evidence-based methods of assessment and treatment for individuals with
addiction, specifically opioid use disorders (OUD); (2) learn mechanisms and clinical application of rTMS in opioid
use, including the experience in designing and conducting randomized controlled trials; and (3) learn clinical
outcomes data analysis and interpretation using advanced statistical methods. Completion of the training and
research aims will establish a strong foundation from which the candidate will acquire the skills and knowledge
to launch an independent scientific career, as well as provide a publicly available brain stimulation solution to
opioid users."

The overall goal of my research program is to understand adaptation in microbial populations, using a 
combination of mathematical modeling and high-­throughput experimental evolution in budding yeast. At root, 
we aim to predict how evolution chooses probabilistically among different mutational trajectories, to determine 
the rate and outcomes of adaptation. In the short term, evolution depends primarily on the distribution of fitness 
effects of individual mutations. However, on longer timescales epistatic interactions between mutations can be 
crucial. Similarly, mutations often have different fitness effects in different environments (“pleiotropy for 
fitness”). This is essential to evolution in fluctuating environments. Recent work shows that epistasis and 
pleiotropy are strong and common among specific sets of mutations in many microbial systems. However, 
these studies of specific limited sets of mutations cannot fully explain how epistasis and pleiotropy constrain 
the rate, repeatability, or dynamics of adaptation. And even given a complete set of epistatic and pleiotropic

understand the evolution of complex phenotypes, such as compensated antibiotic resistance, multiple 
mutations required for immune escape, or multiple gene knockouts enabling cancer evolution.  
The central objective of this proposal is to examine the role of epistasis and pleiotropy for fitness in the 
evolution of microbial populations. Rather than characterizing specific examples, we propose to survey the 
overall statistics of epistasis and pleiotropy that are relevant for constraining microbial adaptation, and to 
analyze how this epistasis and pleiotropy alters how evolution chooses among possible mutational trajectories. 
In Aim 1, we will quantify statistical patterns of epistasis among both natural variants and mutations relevant to 
adaptation in laboratory budding yeast populations. We will use our data to test recent theoretical predictions 
describing how overall statistical patterns of epistasis emerge from individual idiosyncratic interactions. In Aim 
2, we will measure patterns of pleiotropy across hundreds of environmental conditions, and use our data as the 
basis for a novel computational method to infer lower-­dimensional statistical structure in the underlying

evolving and outcrossed recombining laboratory budding yeast populations, using genetic systems we have 
developed to control mating and to continuously barcode lineages. We will interpret these results within the 
context of novel population genetic theory we will develop to predict how epistasis and pleiotropy affect

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern in terms of human disability, medical expenses, and lost
productivity. In addition to immediate mechanical trauma, secondary neurovascular dysfunction, including
cerebral edema, impaired cerebral blood flow, and neuronal cell death, worsens patient outcome in the hours
and days after TBI. Acute activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on myeloid cells aggravates inflammation and
edema after experimental TBI and correlates with poor outcomes after clinical TBI. Activation of myeloid TLR4
increases the polarization of naïve helper T cells (TH0) into pro-inflammatory TH1 and TH17 cells, for weeks
after TBI phenotypes. As TH1 and TH17 cells augment T-cell mediated immunity, amplify pro-inflammatory
macrophage/microglia activation, and perpetuate neurodegeneration, the identification of novel strategies to
reduce post-traumatic inflammation may substantially improve patient outcomes. Endocannabinoids, such as
anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), are arachidonate based
lipids that activate the cannabinoid receptors, CB1R and CB2R. CB2R activation restores immune balance,
reduces edema, improves vasculature function, and enhances behavioral outcomes, suggesting a protective
effect of endocannabinoids after TBI. Of note, activation of the endocannabinoid metabolizing enzyme
monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), which selectively degrades monoacylglycerols, such as 2-AG, into free fatty
acids and glycerol, worsens outcomes after brain injury. However, the role of MAGL remains poorly defined
after TBI. Our long-term goal is to define the regulatory mechanisms and functional implications of eCS after
TBI, which may establish a mechanistic framework to advance the development of immunomodulatory
therapeutics to enhance patient outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that the endocannabinoid metabolizing
enzyme, MAGL, is a molecular switch underlying pro-inflammatory activation after TBI. To test our hypothesis,
we propose three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that myeloid-CB2R activation
improves neurovascular function via suppression of MAGL after TBI. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis
that myeloid-specific TLR4 regulates MAGL in innate immune activation after TBI. Specific Aim 3 will test the
hypothesis that myeloid-specific deletion of MAGL limits myeloid-lymphoid interaction and thus, protects white
matter injury (WMI) and chronic behavioral deficits after TBI. Expected outcomes: Our proposed studies have
far-reaching translational implications, as demonstration of a key role for myeloid MAGL-CB2R-TLR4 in
regulation of inflammation and chronic WMI resolution may result in improved long-term TBI outcomes."
10842450,"An increasing number of epidemiological studies suggest that intestinal microbes are not only central to
maintaining host health, but also constitute etiological factors for the initiation and progression of diseases of the
intestinal tract. However, the mechanisms by which microbes affect intestinal health remain largely unknown.
Using a powerful genetic model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, we have recently shown that microbes not
only alter intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation, but also modulate the relative proportions of differentiated cell
types in the epithelium. Importantly, we found that pathogens promote an enteroendocrine (EE) fate while non-
pathogenic microbes promote an enterocyte (EC) fate, suggesting that pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes
influence ISC lineage in an opposing manner. Based on these results, and from our previous studies, we
hypothesize that gut microbes modulate immune signaling pathways in ISCs to influence their lineage
decisions. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: We will determine the
microbial characteristics (immunogenicity, virulence/damage) that modulate the cellular composition of the gut
epithelium in both Drosophila and murine enteroids. In parallel, we will determine the relative contributions of cell
loss, ISC proliferation and differentiation to this process. Aim 2: We will characterize how a classical immune
pathway, the Imd/Relish pathway (NFκB homologue), acts in Drosophila ISCs and murine enteroids to influence
differentiation in response to gut microbes. We will first identify ISC-specific Relish target genes using a
combination of cell type-specific transcriptomics and targeted DamID (TaDa). We will then analyze how the
Imd/Relish pathway interacts with other gene networks known to control ISC differentiation. Our studies will
therefore demonstrate a new role for Imd/Relish that goes beyond the control of immune effectors and provide
mechanistic insight into how this pathway alters stem cell lineage and epithelial composition. Aim 3: We will
investigate how activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer of activator (STAT) pathway triggers EE
fate commitment in Drosophila ISCs and murine enteroids. We will identify direct and indirect target genes of
STAT in order to characterize downstream mechanisms and delineate the impact that JAK-STAT signaling has
on ISC differentiation. Finally, we aim to clarify how the interaction between the JAK-STAT and Imd/Relish
pathways determines the opposite ISC fates produced in the gut by pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes.
Outcomes of this research will improve our understanding of how the microbiota alters intestinal homeostasis in
health and disease and demonstrate that different gut microbes (pathogenic vs non-pathogenic) alter gut
epithelial composition by differentially modulating ISC differentiation. We will also identify a new role for pathways
classically defined as immune pathways in affecting ISC differentiation, providing new mechanistic insight into
how ISCs respond to their microbial environment. The mechanistic principles identified in our study will therefore
pave the way to a better understanding of diseases of gut origin and potentiate the development of new therapies."

A fuller understanding of living systems at the molecular level has led to revolutionary changes in the fields of
chemistry and biology and has made the boundary between these traditional disciplines less defined. To
leverage the exciting scientific advances at the chemistry-biology interface and to be poised to make major
contributions to biology and medicine, chemists and biologists must speak a common scientific language. The
Chemistry-Biology Interface Training Program (CBI-TP) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)
will offer an environment in which chemists and biologists can acquire interdisciplinary training that enables
them to learn a common language and to acquire a shared set of research skills without compromising their
ability to acquire deep discipline-specific knowledge in specialized areas of chemistry or biology. Through
shared experiences in the classroom and in the laboratory, the CBI-TP is intended to enhance the studies of
graduate students enrolled in six departments at UIUC: Chemistry, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,
Biochemistry, Microbiology, Cell and Developmental Biology, and Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Each
year, 12 trainees will be supported by the NIH, in addition to 5 matching positions supported by UIUC.
Highlights of the program include courses specifically developed for the CBI-TP (including a hands-on
laboratory course), first year laboratory rotations, strong training in rigor and reproducibility, an opportunity for
internships, a highly diverse student body, and extremely strong institutional support. The program also offers
unique opportunities for professional and career development including (i) a student-run seminar program
during which trainees invite, host, and discuss their research with outside seminar speakers, (ii) creation of
Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for which trainees are required to research at least three career options,
join a professional organization, and attend at least one career-related workshop, (iii) options to earn relevant
certifications such as the Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Management, and/or take part in internships, and
(iv) participation in multiple career development activities, intended to better prepare graduate students at the
chemistry-biology interface for interesting and challenging career paths and opportunities. No matter their
ultimate career goals, the CBI-TP platform at UIUC, running for 14 years now, has no equivalent elsewhere on
our campus. The goal of the CBI-TP is to arm trainees with the breadth of education necessary to bridge the
gap between the chemical and biological sciences. The trainees have been, and will continue to be, among
those scientists making significant contributions to biomedicine as participants in and leaders of
multidisciplinary teams in industry, government, or academia."

There is a need to understand the mechanisms of neural stimulation technologies (RFA-NS-18-018). The impact
of such research increases with both the clinical relevance of a neuromodulation technology and the extent
mechanisms are unknown. Spinal Cord Stimulation at kHz frequencies (kHz SCS) has undergone a meteoric
clinical and market rise, in the absence of an accepted mechanistic hypothesis. The most peculiar feature of kHz
SCS mechanistically is that rapid biphasic stimulation undermines traditional mechanisms of electrical
stimulation. But, we note this same feature of rapid pulsing results in high stimulation power leading to our
hypothesis that kHz SCS increases tissue temperature. Our proposal that a clinically-established implanted
electrical stimulation device would unexpectantly function by joule heating is disruptive and innovative and so
requires, as the first step, to establish the degree of temperature increase during kHz SCS. To this end, our
research plan develops state-of-the-art tools for multi-physics bioheat modeling (Aim 1), multi-compartment 3D-
lattice phantom verification (Aim 2), and validation in a swine model (Aim 3) to methodically test the hypothesis
that kHz SCS produces a 0.5-2 oC temperature rise. The multi-physics model (Aim 1) will be state-of-the-at in
anatomical resolution, internal lead architecture, and the first to couple joule heat, heat conduction and
convection (CSF flow), metabolism, and blood flow perfusion. The heat phantom (Aim 2) will be the first for spinal
cord stimulation based on novel 3D-lattice printed compartments. The swine model (Aim 3) is selected for
anatomical similarities to the human spinal cord and vertebral canal, and will include a custom fabricated
combination lead/sensor array for in vivo temperature mapping. The most peculiar clinical feature of kHz SCS is
lack of paresthesia, associated with conventional SCS. We will develop a dorsal horn network model of heating-
based analgesia (Aim 4) by integrating experimentally validated temperature increases, pain processing network
dynamics, and membrane sensitivity to temperature (Q10). We hypothesize a 0.5-2 0C temperature rise
generates pain relief through the same final MoA as conventional SCS (gate-control) but without pacing
associated paresthesia. RFA responsive, this “computational model incorporates cellular heterogeneity”,
specifically electrophysiological data on of excitatory vs inhibitory superficial dorsal horn interneurons, including
differential responses to heating. While device design, disease models, and clinical trials are explicitly outside
RFA scope, establishing a novel MoA and state-of-the-art tools developed in each Aim implicitly drive and
underpin such developments. Directly RFA responsive, we “improve understanding of the neurobiological
underpinnings of existing methods and lay the foundation for the next generation technologies by developing
models (Aim 1, 4), systems (Aim 2), and procedures (Aim 3) to guide the design of better neuromodulation tools”.
Indeed, because the heating MoA is fundamentally innovative, new tools are needed."

 Generativity—defined as concern and care for the well-being of others, especially younger
generations—is related to better physical and mental health in older adults. Despite the potential for
generativity interventions to serve as an important method for improving health and well-being in this
population, this is a highly understudied area of research. Furthermore, neurobiological mechanisms behind
the effects of generativity on health and well-being have never been examined. As such, this proposal aims to
fill these critical gaps in the literature. The goal of this NIA R01 is to investigate the effect of a writing-based
generativity intervention on well-being and inflammation in older adults, as well as to examine underlying
neurobiological mechanisms behind improvements. Participants (ntotal=200) will be randomly assigned to a 6-
week intervention aimed at increasing perceptions of generativity (vs. a control condition). During pre- and
post-intervention sessions, all participants will complete: 1) self-report measures of social, mental, and physical
well-being, 2) a blood draw (in order to assess multiple markers of inflammation), and 3) a neuroimaging
session (in order to assess the caregiving system as a potential neurobiological mechanism). It is hypothesized
that participants in the generativity intervention, compared to those in the control condition, will show: 1)
improvements in multiple domains of well-being, 2) improvements in biological markers of inflammation (e.g.,
decreases in pro-inflammatory gene expression), and 3) activation of the neural caregiving system (i.e.,
increases in neural activity in caregiving-related regions and decreases in threat-related neural activity).
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that activation of the neural caregiving system will mediate observed self-
reported improvements in social, mental, and physical well-being, as well as inflammatory activity. This study
will fill a crucial gap in our understanding of the effect of generativity on well-being and inflammation, as well as
the underlying neurobiology of these effects. Finally, these results may ultimately have large-scale public
health implications, as they could inform a low-cost, low-effort method for improving health and well-being in
older adults."

Photodissociation (Thermo), a Q Exactive HF-X (Thermo) and a TQ-XS (Waters). The DPM has a full-time staff
of eleven scientists, including six PhDs (four Research Professors, one scientific staff member and one Post-
Doc). This group has over 195 years’ combined experience in mass spectrometry and more than 379 authored
or co-authored publications (counting publications with two DMP members as co-authors as two author-
publications). The resource is located in a new (2017) ~8,100 sq. ft. laboratory in the Chesterfield Building in
downtown Durham, custom built for mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics. By working closely
with vendors to obtain extensive discounts, prudent use of DPM Betterments Funds towards the new equipment,
and the DCI CCSG support, the DPM has maintained cost-effective (revenue neutral) support for the DCI at
state-of-the-art levels. The DPM’s objective is to generate high-quality data by providing full service to its
customers. This includes initial consultations to create optimal experimental designs, use of rigorous QC
protocols and standards from sample preparation through sample analyses, and generation of detailed reports
to ensure clarity on experimental approach and results. Use of a Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS) ensures sample integrity (unique Project Numbers and Sample IS numbers automatically assigned by
the LIMS), and the use of a true ‘fingerprinted’ data repository (“GCB Express Data Repository”) ensures data
integrity.
 In 2018, the DPM provided services to 95 DCI members (41% of unique users), who accounted for 17% of
total usage and represented 7 of the 8 DCI Research Programs. Use of this shared resource by DCI Members
contributed to 65 publications over the project period, 19 of which were in high impact journals (IF>9),
demonstrating the value of services offered by the resource. During this time, the DPM received support from
the DCI CCSG and Institutional Support from the SoM in the form of new lab costs (design and build of new
facility in the Chesterfield building) and new instrumentation (three state-of-the-art mass spectrometers).

10843062,"ABSTRACT – RODENT CANCER MODELS SHARED RESOURCE
 The Rodent Cancer Models Shared Resource (RCM) provides Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) members a full
service approach to the investigation of cancer biology, from the creation of rodent models through the testing
of chemotherapeutics. To achieve that goal DCI’s RCM combined two primary services: the Cancer Center
Isolation Facility (CCIF) and the Rodent Genetic Engineering Services Team (RGEST). CCIF is a 30,000 square
foot, stand-alone rodent barrier facility located in the heart of the Duke biomedical campus operated by the Duke
Division of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) and dedicated to cancer research. The CCIF physical plant
supports work with hazardous materials at biosafety level 2 (BSL2), recombinant DNA, chemotherapeutics, as
well as the maintenance of immunosuppressed (outbred athymic nude mice and inbred Nod SCID gamma (NSG)
mice) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) rodents. Occupying space in CCIF and in nearby facities, RGEST
produces custom designed, genetically altered, transgenic and gene-targeted mice. RCM personnel assist DCI
investigators who require assistance with breeding services, veterinary or diagnostic services, animal and
experimental protocol development, inoculation or testing of cell lines, and guidance for conducting safe and
efficient cancer biology research. CCIF also provides equipment and rodent housing space for the CCSG-
supported Optical Molecular Imaging and Analysis (OMIA) shared resource. Recently, significant investments
by the Duke School of Medicine have enabled upgrades to CCIF and RGEST equipment.
 In 2018, the RCM provided services to 78 investigators, 61% of whom were DCI members and who
accounted for 94% of total usage and represented all 8 DCI Research Programs. Use of this shared resource
by DCI Members contributed to 332 DCI publications over the project period, 103 of which were in high impact
journals (Impact Factor>9), demonstrating the value of RCM services. The immediate and long-term objectives
of the RCM are to continue to provide high-quality barrier facility services, low-cost, high-quality
immunocompromised and SPF mice and genetically engineered animal models using cutting edge approaches,
improve and upgrade services when possible, and to provide key expertise and services to DCI members
studying cancer biology and developing new agents for treating or diagnosing human cancers."
10843063,"ABSTRACT – CANCER CONTROL AND POPULATION SCIENCES PROGRAM
 The central themes of the Cancer Control and Population Sciences Research Program (CCPS) at the Duke
Cancer Institute (DCI) are to reduce the cancer burden in the DCI catchment area, with particular attention to
cancer health disparities, and to foster collaboration with other DCI researchers, health systems, and
communities. CCPS galvanizes and guides its researchers by organizing around two Focus Areas: (1) Risk
Identification and Reduction; and (2) Patient Outcomes and Survivorship. These Focus Areas are aligned with
our first two Specific Aims. The first Aim is to identify causes of cancer and design programs to reduce cancer
risk in our catchment area. Our primary objectives for Aim 1 are to: 1) discover novel aspects of risk factors and
biomarkers to improve risk prediction; 2) refine screening guidelines to maximize gains and minimize harms; and
3) develop and implement programs to promote healthy behaviors. Our second Aim is to optimize cancer care
delivery starting with diagnosis, through treatment, survivorship, and palliative care. Our primary objectives for
Aim 2 are to: 1) develop cutting-edge interventions to enhance cancer patient and family members’ experiences;
2) use eHealth/mHealth and other new technologies to improve symptom management and outcomes for cancer
patients; and 3) conduct innovative trials and research to improve transitions of care and end-of-life support. Our
scientific efforts span the cancer care continuum from primary prevention to palliative care. CCPS provides a
broad spectrum of resources to its members to facilitate collaboration and to address the needs of our catchment
area. Our scientific areas for future growth include a focus on onco-primary care, infectious diseases and cancer,
cardio-oncology, data science, and cancer and aging. Our third Aim is programmatically-focused, and we seek
to support collaboration and education. We specifically aim to increase collaborations across DCI to address
catchment area priorities and to provide more formal training of our junior investigators. Value added of CCPS
to the DCI includes facilitating DCI-wide working groups that bring CCPS members together with other DCI
program members to address important topics, such as sexual health of cancer patients, tobacco, childhood
cancer, and cancer and aging.
 CCPS is comprised of 49 primary members and 19 secondary members from 12 departments and 5 schools
within Duke University. Total direct funding for primary program members is $14.5M, of which $11.6M is peer
reviewed, including $3.5M from the NCI. From 2014 through 2018, primary program members published 1,518
papers in peer-reviewed journals, 26% were intra-programmatic and 27% were inter-programmatic
collaborations. During the current grant period, the program enrolled 3,308 participants to all trials, 1,647 to
interventional trials, and 161 to treatment trials. Overall, CCPS is an active and collaborative program whose
research is vision-driven, responsive to the needs of our catchment area, and whose members’ work has had a
direct impact on national guidelines and statewide policies that influence cancer care and the cancer burden."
10843066,"ABSTRACT – CANCER GENETICS AND GENOMICS PROGRAM
 The Duke Cancer Institute’s Cancer Genetics and Genomics (CGG) Program is a basic science program
whose goals are to define the genetic changes that drive tumorigenesis, to understand the origins and
consequences of these changes, and to use the knowledge gained to inform cancer diagnosis and treatment.
CGG members use diverse and complementary experimental approaches that include structural biology,
biochemistry, cell biology, genetics and genomics and employ model organisms as well as pre-clinical models.
 Within the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI), the CGG Program serves as the primary source of genetics and
genomics expertise and broadly facilitates the application of ‘omics’ technologies to assess alterations in cancer
genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes. As such, the Program coordinates DCI research activities related to
the study and understanding of cancer genetics, epigenetics, gene expression, genome instability and genomics.
The CGG fosters interactions and collaborations with other DCI programs.
 The CGG Program is organized into three focus groups: (1) Genomics and Epigenetics, (2) Recombination,
Replication and Repair, and (3) Viral Oncology and Microbiomes. These focus groups reflect the diversity of
factors that promote the development of cancer and alter the course of the disease. Each focus group provides
opportunities for interaction and collaboration through research-in progress meetings and mini-symposia. In
addition, each focus group is closely aligned with a T32 training grant that facilitates the education/mentoring
goals of the Program and the DCI. The CGG fosters interactions between the focus groups through a monthly
program-wide seminar and quarterly meetings designed to foster collaboration and multi-PI grants.
 The CGG program is comprised of 35 primary members and 25 secondary members from 10 departments
and two schools within Duke University. Total direct funding for primary program members is $10.3M, of which
$8.8M is peer reviewed, including $2.5M from the NCI. From 2014-2018, program members published 451
papers in peer-reviewed journals, 12% were intra-programmatic and 31% inter-programmatic collaborations."
10843069,"ABSTRACT – NEURO-ONCOLOGY PROGRAM 
 According to data published by the National Cancer Institute in 2014, there were an estimated 162,341 
people living with brain and other nervous system cancer in the United States. Malignant primary brain tumors 
are the most frequent cause of cancer death in children and young adults and account for more deaths than 
cancer of the kidney or melanoma. 
 The Neuro-Oncology Program is one of the most well-known and oldest cancer programs at Duke, having 
celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2017. The first to establish brain tumor research and clinical activities at Duke 
was Dr. Barnes Woodhall, who came to Duke from Johns Hopkins in 1937. The Neuro-Oncology Program has 
been a premier program within the DCI since its initial designation as an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center in 
1972. 
 Research ranges from the most basic science to clinical trials encompassing various focus areas including 
basic and functional genomics; establishment of a world class biorepository including more than 4000 adult and 
pediatric brain tumor samples, more than 80 xenografts and transgenic models to recapitulate human disease 
and for drug/agent screening; development of novel immunotherapies for primary and metastatic CNS tumors; 
design and execution of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials; improving patient’s quality of life and treatment 
experience through Supportive Care clinical trials; and molecular epidemiology and genomic studies to identify 
causation factors of malignant brain tumors. This research is driven by the Neuro-Oncology Program’s mission 
to identify the cause and relevant tumor biomarkers in all major types of adult and childhood malignant brain 
tumors and to invent and translate novel therapeutics from screening in innovative and predictive model systems 
to human testing and development in pioneering clinical trials. Maintenance of the comprehensive tumor 
biorepository and training of the next generation of neuro-oncologists ensures the continuing development of the 
Neuro-Oncology Program and its research goals. 
 The Program is comprised of 27 primary members and 6 secondary members from a wide spectrum of 8 
different departments and 1 school and institutes within Duke University. Total direct funding for primary 
Program members is $11.9M of which $6.1M is peer reviewed, including $3.7M from the NCI. From 2014-2018, 
Program members published 415 papers in peer-reviewed journals cited in PubMed. Of these publications, 33% 
are the result of intra-programmatic collaborations and 36% are due to inter-programmatic collaborations. During 
the current grant period, the program enrolled 948 subjects to all trials, 736 to interventional trials, and 551 to 
treatment trials."
10843070,"ABSTRACT – RADIATION ONCOLOGY AND IMAGING PROGRAM
 The Radiation Oncology and Imaging Program (ROI) comprehensively includes radiation biologists,
imaging scientists, medical physicists, bioengineers, radiation oncologists and radiologists. The goals of the
ROI are to foster research interactions that stimulate the integration of basic science, bioengineering, and
clinical trials to: 1) increase the local control of tumors by radiation therapy while minimizing side effects; and
2) develop and evaluate imaging methods and imaging biomarkers for localized and disseminated cancer.
These aims align with the themes of the Program to: 1) understand the mechanisms of tumor and normal
tissue response to radiation; and 2) develop imaging methods to detect and stage cancer and for image-
guided therapy and response assessment. To accomplish these goals, the ROI sponsors several venues for
interaction including a monthly seminar series and a yearly retreat.
 ROI members’ clinical and translational research are supported by dedicated clinical research MR and
PET/CT scanners, as well as clinical trial managers and clinical research coordinators, who are devoted to
accruing patients to clinical trials within our Program. A tumor metrics service is available in Radiology to
support clinical trials in the Duke Cancer Institute. Clinical investigators have utilized this infrastructure to
undertake a number of investigator-initiated clinical trials (n=16) and cooperative group trials (n=7) over the
past 5 years within the Department of Radiation Oncology. Program members in the Department of Radiology
also participate in the imaging cooperative group trials conducted by ACRIN, as well as imaging components
in other cooperative group trials. In addition, a number of the Program members are leaders of national
clinical trials within cooperative groups (e.g., NRG, ECOG-ACRIN, and SARC).
 Program members’ research efforts in radiation biology and imaging also are facilitated by multi-
investigator grants including a P41 grant from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and
Bioengineering (NIBIB) that supports the Center for In-Vivo Microscopy and a U19 grant from the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that supports a Center for Medical Countermeasures
against Radiation. The Program includes 39 primary members and 10 secondary members from 8
departments and 3 schools within Duke University. Total direct funding for primary program members is
$12.4M, of which $6.9M is peer-reviewed, including $4.3M from the NCI. From 2014 to 2018, program
members published 1,060 papers with cancer relevance in peer-reviewed journals; 33% were intra-
programmatic and 33% were inter-programmatic collaborations. During 2014 through 2018, the program
enrolled 1,193 subjects to all trials, 958 to interventional trials, and 233 to treatment trials.

10843076,"ABSTRACT – WOMEN’S CANCER PROGRAM
 The Duke Cancer Insitute’s Women’s Cancer Program (WC) is a multidisciplinary clinical, basic, and
translational research effort whose overall goal is to improve outcomes for women with breast and gynecologic
cancers. The broad, long-term goal of the WC Program is to build on and extend current knowledge in the field
of breast and gynecological cancers and to develop novel strategies for improving therapeutic results.
 Significant progress has been made in identifying pathways of pathological importance in cancer and in
validation of steps in these pathways as therapeutic targets. However, genetic heterogeneity among cancers,
and the utilization of different growth and survival pathways by different tumor types, have made it difficult to
realize the therapeutic potential of even the most tractable targets. Thus a central theme of the research being
undertaken by members of the Women’s Cancer Program is biological study of breast and gynecological cancers
and development of therapeutic strategies tailored to specific cancer subtypes. These efforts have led to
identification of potential targets, the modulation of which are likely to selectively impact triple negative breast
cancer, endocrine-resistant ER-positive breast cancers, inflammatory breast cancer, or gynecologic cancers.
This successful strategy will be continued with efforts to: (a) Elucidate the biological basis of breast and
gynecologic cancers with a focus on defining therapeutically actionable pathways and relevant biomarkers; (b)
Develop and accrue to innovative clinical trials that build upon the scientific expertise of the program members;
(c) Facilitate health services research that optimizes use of health care resources in a cost-effective manner
while accounting for personal characteristics of individual patients such as genetic variation in risk and patient
preferences; and (d) Provide structured mentoring and career development programs for junior faculty,
postdoctoral fellows and students.
 Reflecting the breadth of the interests and expertise of its constituency, the Program’s activities establish,
maintain, and strengthen infrastructure that fosters scientific interaction for research to generate novel strategies
for the prevention, detection, and treatment of breast and gynecological cancers. The program is comprised of
29 primary members and 8 secondary members from 11 different departments and 4 schools within Duke
University. Total direct funding for primary program members is $14.5M, of which $11.4M is peer reviewed,
including $3.5M from the NCI. From 2014-2018, program members published 747 papers in peer-reviewed
journals, 26% were intra-programmatic collaborations and 44% were inter-programmatic collaborations. During
the current grant period, the program enrolled 2,829 subjects to all trials, 933 to interventional trials, and 342 to
treatment trials."
10843084,"ABSTRACT – DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
 Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Developmental Funds are instrumental to the DCI strategic research priorities
and provide resources to augment its Research Programs and Strategic Initiatives. In the current grant cycle,
DCI Developmental Funds, comprised of CCSG, institutional and philanthropic funds, have supported
collaborative, translational and novel high-impact pilot projects, recruitment of new investigators, and emerging
technologies that promote innovative new research of DCI members.
 The DCI supports multiple Pilot Grant Programs, including one which alternatively emphasizes collaborative
projects (intra-programmatic, inter-programmatic, population science) and translational projects (laboratory
discoveries into diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic applications), solicited through a “Request for Applications”
(RFA) twice each year. Additionally, DCI has targeted Pilot Grant Programs each year focused on strategic
topics, which are supported by multiple sources, including institutional and philanthropic funds. The strategic
areas of focus in the current funding period are: i) Cancer Control; ii) Cancer and the Environment; iii) Supportive
Care and Survivorship; iv) Comparative Oncology (an external collaboration with the College of Veterinary
Medicine at NC State University); v) Solid Tumor Brain Metastasis; vi) BRCA-associated cancers; and vii)
collaboration between cancer and engineering research. Faculty recruitment that represents a strategic
investment as outlined by the DCI strategic plan and DCI senior leaders are eligible for Developmental Funds
as part of their initial recruitment package, or within three years of their faculty appointment. The recruitment
funds are made available at any time throughout the year to maintain optimal flexibility in faculty recruitment.
Developmental Funds are also available through solicitations offered twice per year for support of a new service
line, creation and implementation of a new technique, or a technology investment that enhances existing shared
resource services and expands the research tools of DCI investigators.
 All applications for DCI Developmental Funds are reviewed by the Scientific Review Committee (SRC) or the
Shared Resource Oversight Committee (SROC). The DCI Steering Committee is charged with strategic
oversight of the DCI Developmental Funds. The final funding decisions are based on assessment of availability
of funds and prioritization of strategic investments, with approval by the DCI Executive Director.
 During this funding period, DCI Developmental Funds were used to support pilot and collaborative projects,
recruitment of faculty, and shared resource investment. The $2.9M of CCSG Developmental Funds were
augmented by additional $29.4M of institutional/philanthropic funds in all three categories. In the next funding
period, CCSG investments will continue to be augmented by institutional and philanthropic funds to advance DCI
scientific discoveries, support collaborative working groups and invest in shared resources to ensure DCI
members have the necessary services and technologies to achieve the DCI mission and vision."
10842467,"Project Summary
Spatially and temporally precise Ca2+ signals control a vast spectrum of cellular functions including contraction,
secretion, transcription, and growth. These signals are mediated by the coordinated function of Ca2+ sensors
and Ca2+ channels. STIM proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are luminal Ca2+ sensors in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) that physically couple to highly Ca2+-selective plasma membrane Orai channels, through an
extraordinarily dynamic inter-membrane ER-PM junctional coupling process, to generate ""store-operated"" Ca2+
signals. Dysregulation of STIM/Orai expression is associated with a range of disorders including renal fibrosis,
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immune deficiency, muscle weakness, skin dysplasia, and cancer. The proposed
studies address the crucial unsolved questions of how STIM proteins undergo activation, what is the molecular
basis of coupling between the distinct STIM and Orai isoforms to generate Ca2+ signals, and what is the
pathophysiological role that the STIM/Orai pathway in cellular remodeling in disease, in particular, in the
mediation of fibrosis, a major feature in multiple chronic diseases leading to global morbidity. Understanding this
fundamental signaling mechanism provides critical new information to generate pharmacological tools to modify
Ca2+ signals and alleviate diseases of cellular growth and remodeling. Genetic alterations giving rise to gain or
loss of function of STIM and Orai proteins lead to severe immunological, muscular, skin, and neural deficits in
humans, and provide critical molecular insights into the structure/function of STIM/Orai proteins.
To deepen our understanding of this critical signaling pathway, the project goals focus on: (1) Investigating the
mechanisms underlying STIM protein activation by Ca2+ store-sensing or temperature change, and the precise
molecular coupling of STIM proteins to Orai channels, focusing on the highly distinct STIM and Orai isoforms,
and utilizing precise molecular/genetic probes, imaging technology, and gene-deleted cell lines and animal
models: (2) Studying how the small molecule 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB) specifically modulates
STIM/Orai isoforms, using genetically-encoded and optogenetically/chemogenetically applied Ca2+ probes
tagged onto STIM and Orai proteins to monitor cytosolic Ca2+ signals mediated by STIM/Orai, and exploring how
2-APB provides crucial information on STIM-mediated clustering of Orai channels and controls local junctional
Ca2+ signals, advancing our mechanistic understanding and the development of small molecules targeting the
STIM/Orai pathway; (3) Examining how STIM/Orai-mediated calcium signals regulate fibrosis in both cellular and
animal model systems, focusing on how the STIM1/Orai2 isoform pathway can be modified to regulate the
process of fibrosis, determining transcriptomal changes related to STIM-specific Ca2+ signal generation, and
utilizing a novel STIM-specific inhibitory peptide, Orai3-M4x, to regulate cell remodeling. Overall, the program of
study seeks to understand the fundamental STIM/Orai signaling pathway that has enormous potential in
alleviating a spectrum of pathological states mediated by cellular growth and tissue remodeling."
10842493,"Microbes employ diverse defense systems to provide protection from viruses, and studying these systems is
important for understanding immune system evolution, phage therapy, and the discovery of new molecular tools
such as CRISPR-Cas systems. While it’s broadly thought that CRISPR-Cas systems work exclusively by
degrading nucleic acids, we’ve recently shown that membrane perturbation by accessory proteins (e.g., Csx28)
are an unappreciated aspect of CRISPR-Cas’s mechanism of action. However, the molecular mechanisms of
how proteins like Csx28 function are unknown. The goal of my research is to understand how CRISPR-Cas
systems and their membrane-associated proteins function together to enhance anti-viral defense with an eye
towards the discovery of new tools. This proposal focuses on addressing the following gaps: 1) What is the
mechanistic and structural details of Csx28 activation by Cas13? We recently discovered that the RNA-targeting
Cas enzyme Cas13 is communicating with membrane pore protein Csx28, to mount a robust anti-viral immune
response, however we still don’t understand what the precise molecular mechanism involved. Our preliminary
data indicate that Cas13 generated RNA cleavage products are acting as ligands to gate Csx28 channel activity.
We will use RNA sequencing and membrane biophysics approaches to determine the precise RNA ligands
modulating Csx28 activity and how these ligands affect gating of the Csx28 pore, respectively. These
experiments will shed light on the molecular details of fascinating anti-phage synergy between Cas13 and Csx28
and provide a clear path for technology development. 2) Do Csx28-like proteins have roles in anti-viral defense
outside of CRISPR systems? With our structural studies of Csx28 coupled with the recent advances in structure
prediction databases, we discovered that Csx28 shares very close structural similarity to a family of hypothetical
proteins that reside in potentially new immune systems. We hypothesize that these Csx28-like proteins are
employed to modulate membrane function during viral infection, however no experimental studies have been
done. We will use similar genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches to our previous work on Csx28 to
study these putative membrane proteins. 3) How does Cas13 associated protein Csx27 modulate antiphage
defense? Csx27 is a predicted transmembrane CRISPR accessory gene that resides within a subset of Cas13b
containing loci. Csx27 has recently been shown to work with Cas13b from to modulate anti-phage defense,
however the mechanism is not understood. Our preliminary data suggest that Csx27, while bearing no similarity
to Csx28, also acts as a membrane pore and activation by Cas13b results in a similar loss of membrane potential,
and a muted metabolism, however more work needs to be done to understand the details these of effects. We
will use a similar set of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches that were successful previously for Csx28
with the goal of understanding of Csx27’s role in Cas13b antiphage defense, and to pave the way for downstream
technology e.g., potential applications that tie RNA expression levels to the modulation of membrane behavior."

Small molecule probes are critical to the investigation and treatment of human diseases. Our group is exploring
the basic biology of various human diseases (e.g., cancer, opioid addiction, malaria, bacterial biofilms) using
an array of new small molecule probes. During this award, we will advance our ring distortion platform using a
panel of readily available indole alkaloids as starting points for the dramatic altering of their complex ring
systems leveraging dearomative cycloadditions along with other chemoselective reactions. Active compounds
identified from our ring distortion platform have gained new biological functions as their activities are unrelated
to their parent natural product and other scaffolds. In essence, we have re-engineered the biological activities
of select indole alkaloids to study diverse disease states and now we aim to explore the modes of action
regarding these new probes. This basic (chemical synthesis) technology has served as a launching point to
discover and explore new biology in multiple disease areas. We will develop probes for transcript profiling
experiments and/or target identification expeditions, as necessary. In addition, we have identified a series of
halogenated phenazines (HP) that demonstrate potent antibacterial and biofilm-eradicating activities against
critical Gram-positive pathogens. These findings are significant as bacterial biofilms, or surface-attached
bacterial communities, house persistent, non-replicating bacteria (“persister cells”) that demonstrate tolerance
to all classes of antibiotics. Biofilms pose a significant threat to human health as 17 million new biofilm-
associated infections occur annually that result in 550,000 deaths in the United States. During this award, we
aim to expand the spectrum of activity for halogenated phenazine agents and eradicate Gram-negative
bacterial pathogens through the development of new phenazine-forming reactions to incorporate primary
amine moieties (following eNTRy rule guidelines) and develop HP-sideromycin agents to target specific Gram-

Racial and ethnic diversity in the biomedical research workforce produces higher quality science,
expands the national research agenda, and increases clinical trial participation among
underrepresented populations. Nevertheless, racial and ethnic diversity in the biomedical research
workforce remains low, and the United States Congress has cited the lack of diversity in the
biomedical research workforce as a serious concern. Diversity among physician-scientists is
particularly important. Because of their expertise in clinical medicine and scientific research,
physician-scientists play a valuable role in the biomedical research enterprise, and diversity among
physician-scientists is essential to generate impactful science. Although Increasing diversity is a
national imperative, evidence-based interventions remain elusive, and a lack of diversity in the
biomedical research enterprise persists. In 2020, despite comprising 13% and 19% of the U.S.
population, only 2% and 5% of NIH R01 grants were awarded to Black and Latinx scientists,
respectively. In order to meaningfully disrupt this lack of representation and advance the science of
workforce diversity, our group, the Promoting Diversity, Group Inclusion and Equity (ProDiGIE)
research lab will address three fundamental knowledge gaps. First, through an innovative positive-
deviance study design, we will identify evidence-based interventions to increase the racial and ethnic
diversity of trainees pursuing a career as a physician-scientist. Second, we will identify strategies to
promote and sustain physician-scientist professional identity formation among trainees
underrepresented in science. Third, we will identify interventions to foster the success of faculty in
academic medical centers, which receive over two-thirds of all NIH funding. The proposed research
program will comprehensively and systematically investigate interventions to promote diversity across
the physician-scientist career span from trainees to NIH-funded faculty."
10842634,"Project Summary / Abstract
My research program centers on defining how cellular forces impinge on chromatin dynamics, gene
regulation, and genome integrity, in part through force transduction across the nuclear envelope by the
Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. In the next five years, we plan to investigate
both the genetic and non-genetic functions of chromatin with the goal of revealing new insights into the
mechanics of chromosomes, the emergent biophysical properties of nuclei, and the mechanisms that
underlie nuclear mechanotransduction. As we previously demonstrated the key role that chromatin plays in
dictating the emergent mechanical properties of the nucleus, one major focus will be on examining the non-
genetic role that the epigenome plays in defining nuclear mechanics. Although altered epigenetic histone
modifications are tied to numerous diseases, the potential contribution of these changes to nuclear
mechanics is largely unstudied. We will take both targeted and open approaches to leverage our unique
tools to assess nuclear mechanics to make fundamental discoveries on this topic. While the attributes of
chromatin within the nucleus impacts the nuclear force response, exerting forces on chromatin likely also
changes its properties and/or function. We plan to take on two major challenges in this area. First, taking
advantage of the tools available in the fission yeast S. pombe, we will define an important biophysical
parameter, the genomic distance over which forces can be propagated along a chromosome, represented
by the persistence length, or bending rigidity, of chromatin in vivo. Our experiments to date strongly suggest
that literature values for chromatin persistence length, largely derived from in vitro studies or relying on
simulations, cannot explain the extent to which force can be propagated down the chromosome in living
cells. Defining this parameter is not only critical for simulations and the interpretation of experimental data in
the chromatin biology field, but is also essential for the study of nuclear mechanotransduction – the process
by which forces are translated into gene expression changes. This fundamental line of questioning will
position us to take on a second key challenge in the field: defining the contexts and mechanisms by which
forces on LINC complexes influence the transcriptome. We will continue to leverage cell lines and mouse
models lacking the SUN protein components of LINC complexes to rigorously define genetic targets of
direct force transmission and to begin to tackle the black box of the translation of force into gene expression
changes. Taken together, this proposed research program will position us to make critical and long-lasting
contributions to the field of nuclear mechanobiology."

TMEM16A is a calcium-activated chloride channel that is required for numerous physiologic
processes, including regulation of neuronal and cardiac excitability, uterine contractility,
regulation of electrolyte balance, and sensory transduction. Their importance is supported by
the embryonic lethality of TMEM16A knockout mice, and by the association of mutations in this
channel with craniofacial, breast, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to intracellular calcium,
TMEM16A channels are regulated by membrane lipids produced in the body. The long-term
goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable TMEM16A
channels to respond to cellular changes to alter channel activity. The overall objectives of the
experiments outlined in this proposal is to uncover how the membrane phospholipid
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binds to the channel to enable chloride conduction,
uncover the signaling events that turn on these channels in their native cells, and to delineate
how polyunsaturated fatty acids regulate channel activity. We will ask the following questions: 1)
How does the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) potentiate
TMEM16A channels? 2) How does arachidonic acid and its metabolites inhibit TMEM16A?
Finally, 3) How does fertilization open TMEM16A channels in eggs from the African clawed frog,
Xenopus laevis? The proposed research includes conceptual and technical innovations and is
significant because it is expected to provide detailed mechanisms by which TMEM16A responds
to changing cellular environments. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to offer new
opportunities for the development of innovative therapies to treat TMEM16A-associated
diseases."

Alzheimer's disease (AD), in particular la‐te onset AD, is the most common form of dementia, accounting for
about two thirds of all the dementia cases, and its pathogenesis may start decades early before its actual clinic
manifestation. The search for disease modifying treatments is the primary objective of most rigorous
therapeutic research efforts on AD. However, AD is currently incurable and available therapies are only
effective in partially alleviating selected AD clinical symptoms, but not its onset and/or progression. The unmet
need for the timely development of potent therapies for AD has been constantly growing with the heavy burden
on our healthcare system reaching a critical level. There is an urgent need to reinvigorate AD drug
development by utilizing systems biology, especially network biology approaches which have the potential to
present not only global landscape of pathway-pathway interactions but also detailed molecular
interaction/regulation circuits underlying AD. Network biology approaches to integrate large-scale multi-omics
data in AD have demonstrated that differentially regulated subnetworks in AD, which regulate diverse AD
pathogenic phenotypes, often include a large number of key regulators. Therefore, drugs and drug
combinations that can modulate such subnetworks as a whole are the most pertinent for therapeutic
intervention and have better chance to be successful. In this application, we propose to develop novel
molecular network based drug repositioning approaches to identify individual FDA approved drugs as well as
their combinations that can potentially reverse molecular signatures and network states of AD. A large number
of predicted drugs and drug combinations will be tested in multiple model systems including mouse brain
primary cells, human iPSC derived brain cells and AD mouse models. This project will establish an integrative
platform comprised of highly innovative systems and experimental biology components for rapid drug discovery
for AD."
10849875,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: Aaron Scherer, PhD is a social psychologist who utilizes insights from the psychological sciences
to create innovative preventive healthcare interventions, primarily for health risks that affect adults aged ≥50.
Dr. Scherer’s long-term career objective is to become an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary
research teams in the design and evaluation of innovative, patient-centered interventions to optimize the
delivery and utilization of preventive health services for middle-aged and older adults.
Research Context: Age-associated changes in immune function and chronic conditions coupled with
suboptimal influenza vaccination rates (50%) result in adults aged ≥50 accounting for 95% of the 50,000
influenza-associated deaths that occur every year. Unfortunately, vaccine messaging strategies that health
organizations currently utilize to increase vaccine uptake have been ineffective and, in some cases have
worsened vaccine attitudes. Motivations to satisfy psychological needs such as managing threats, reducing
uncertainty, and achieve social goals may bias how people process vaccine-related information and vaccine
outcomes. “Motivational fit”, an alignment with a motive that undermines adult vaccine uptake, may be a more
effective mechanism of behavior change to target with vaccine interventions than current approaches.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify which motives have the strongest associations with vaccine outcomes for adults
aged ≥50; 2) Collaborate with vaccine-hesitant adults aged ≥50 to create influenza vaccine messages that
have motivational fit; 3) Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a vaccine messaging efficacy study.
Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Scherer will use a national, demographically-diverse online
sample of adults aged ≥50 to identify four motives that are most strongly associated with vaccine uptake (i.e.,
largest effect sizes) for adults aged ≥50 and test whether scales measuring these motives need to be vaccine-
specific. He will then collaborate with vaccine-hesitant adults aged ≥50 to develop and test influenza vaccine
messages targeting each of the four motives. Finally, he will conduct a pilot study with a clinical population to
evaluate the feasibility of conducting planned efficacy studies of the motivational fit vaccine messages.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Scherer will develop 1) foundational content knowledge in the aging process
to engage in aging research, and expertise in 2) psychometrics; 3) patient-centered design; and 4) health
services research with adults aged ≥50. Dr. Scherer’s training goals will be supported by close mentorship
from an interdisciplinary team; advanced didactic coursework; and other career development opportunities.
Environment: The University of Iowa offers an ideal environment for Dr. Scherer to pursue his training; with
mentorship from well-established experts, additional guidance from an advisory committee, and a department
dedicated to his long-term success in becoming an independent investigator in healthy aging research."

nicotine delivery products on smoking, obesity, and relevant clinical outcomes among people with obesity who
smoke (Murphy); (2) investigate the impact of cannabis use and social determinants of health on maternal
mental health in pregnant individuals, specifically focusing on people of color (Gunn); and (3) investigate the
intergenerational effects of parental alcohol use on child externalizing disorders, a predictor of health problems
over the life course (Micalizzi). CADRE PLs and Pilot Project Leaders (PPLs) will benefit from mentorship by
faculty mentors who will provide guidance on research, publication, and grantwriting. As in Phase I, the
Administrative Core will continue to provide organizational structure and state-of-the-art mentoring; administer
the Pilot Projects Program; support diversity and health disparities work; and lead evaluation of all RPs and
center components. The Clinical Laboratory Core will continue to provide research infrastructure and resources
to the PLs and PPLs, thereby enhancing investigator productivity and promoting research rigor and

10849989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
I am a developmental scientist and Assistant Professor at Brown University’s Center for Alcohol and Addiction
Studies. Together with a multidisciplinary mentorship team, I propose a multimethod, intensive longitudinal
study of the associations between parental alcohol use (PAU), parent stress and child externalizing disorders
(EXT). The proposed research project represents an intentional extension of my research, and this award will
serve the dual purpose of facilitating my research independence and expanding the scope of CADRE
research in fulfillment of its mission. This award will provide me with protected time, research infrastructure,
and mentorship that will allow me to expand my program of research to include a new population (children with
severe behavior disorders) and to learn novel methods (alcohol biosensors) that I can incorporate into my
research. Moreover, as a developmentally informed addiction scientist, my integration into the CADRE team
will broaden the expertise currently represented in the CADRE and permit novel avenues of inquiry in CADRE
projects. This research project is aligned with the overarching aims of the CADRE (to advance knowledge of
the impact of substance use on chronic disease) and expands the scope of CADRE research in its
intergenerational focus on the impact of parental substance use on a chronic child condition. Child EXT, a
spectrum of behaviors and disorders including Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, are
common, chronic, and costly developmental disorders that often cascade into life-course persistent problems.
This is especially true for children from low socioeconomic status families who will represent ~60% of the study
sample. Parents and parent-child dynamics exert strong influence on child EXT; here we focus on the
influences of PAU and parent stress on child EXT trajectories across one month of intensive outpatient
treatment for child EXT. We enhance this investigation by exploring parent-child interaction quality as a
potentially modifiable mediator linking PAU and stress to EXT. We focus on a diverse, severe clinical sample of
children engaged in partial hospitalization treatment to characterize these processes among those at greatest
risk for developing cascading, persistent antisocial behaviors. Our multi-informant approach leverages multiple
methods that span levels of analysis; an approach that innovates on existing research. The joint support of the
CADRE Cores will ensure the successful completion of the proposed project. The REACH Core will assist in
the recruitment of a diverse sample, the Clinical Lab Core will provide the requisite supplies, equipment, and
technical and scientific expertise to support the proposed project, and the Administrative Core will provide the
organizational structure, resources, mentoring support, and initiatives that will facilitate the successful
completion of the proposed study and solidify my path to independence."
10849869,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Polypharmacy is common among nursing home (NH) residents and is most prevalent among residents with
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) due to their high burden of multiple chronic conditions that
predispose them to medication use. Polypharmacy is dangerous for NH residents with ADRD because it
substantially increases the risk of drug interactions. Fall-related injuries, including fractures, joint dislocations,
and hemorrhages, are one of the most common and impactful adverse outcomes of drug interactions and result
in morbidity, disability, and death. Many theoretical interactions between drugs have been identified and
healthcare providers believe that drug interactions are common and harmful among older NH residents with
ADRD, yet limited data exist about which interactions are most clinically significant. Given that drug interactions
resulting from polypharmacy are likely a major, yet modifiable, cause of fall-related injuries among older NH
residents with ADRD, identifying drug interactions and their effects is essential for avoiding fall-related injuries.
Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify, test, and validate clinically significant drug interactions
in NH residents with ADRD through a series of rigorous epidemiological studies that employ novel drug
interaction screening and causal inference methods. The central hypothesis is that multiple clinically significant
drug interactions will increase the risk of fall-related injuries, and that this risk will be greatest among individuals
with the most severe cognitive impairment and on higher medication doses. This hypothesis will be tested
through three specific aims: Aim 1 (Screening), Conduct hypothesis-free high-throughput semi-automated
screening to identify potential interactions involving drug pairs and triads that increase the risk of fall-related
injuries among NH residents with ADRD; Aim 2 (Testing), After prioritizing interaction screening results with the
guidance of a multidisciplinary expert stakeholder panel, perform a series of hypothesis-driven studies to quantify
the effects of drug interactions on fall-related injuries, including dose, duration, and NH resident subgroup effects;
and Aim 3 (Replication), Conduct a series of validation studies in independent data to determine whether the
drug interactions identified during screening and testing are consistently associated with fall-related injuries
among NH residents with ADRD. To accomplish the three proposed aims, a large novel database of NH
electronic health record information be leveraged along with national MDS 3.0 clinical assessment records linked
to Medicare health insurance and prescription drug claims. The proposed research is highly significant because
it will provide clinically actionable empirical evidence to help guide the prescribing, deprescribing, and
management of medications to minimize the risk of important drug interactions and fall-related injuries among
NH residents with ADRD. This proposal is directly responsive to PAR-19-070 and advances the National Institute
on Aging's Strategic Goal C to improve the safe use of medications."
10829386,"Core B (Modeling & Experimental Therapeutics Core) - Abstract/Summary
Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models remain central to virtually all aspects of this P01 and have
contributed significantly to our understanding of both mouse and human pancreatic cancer. GEM models,
particularly those with inducible oncogenes, have enabled (i) elucidation of the role of specific genetic/pathway
alterations in tumor biological mechanisms such as autophagy and immunity, (i) dissection of cooperative
interactions between genetic elements such Kras* and different tumor suppressors such as p16ink4a, p53 and
Smad4, and (iii) deconvolution of the heterotypic interactions across different cell types of the tumor
microenvironment such as Kras* in cancer cells and TGFb in immune cells. In this renewal, two reasons
prompted us to establish this new Core. First, the extreme allelic complexity of the models employed in each
Project will benefit from dedicated sophisticated engineering. Along these lines, it is worth noting that our models
may harbor as many as ten genetic alterations. Core B’s ES-GEM system serves as a powerful platform to
introduce new alleles into existing multi-allelic ES lines harboring core PDAC-relevant alleles. Second, nearly all
aims propose preclinical experimental therapeutic trials with GEM models. Such trials will benefit from expert
execution with professional staff where standardized protocols would enable comparison of therapeutic regimens
across the P01. Here again, the ES-GEM system helps tremendously as it enables highly efficient generation
of large cohorts from one or two rounds of blastocyst injection to produce PDAC-prone mice that can be enlisted
into multi-arm trials. The ES-GEM system has been proven to generate experimental cohorts with all the
characteristics of a germline model. In addition, this approach dramatically reduces time and cost associated
with large breeding colonies for therapeutic experiments."
10829389,"Core C (Computational Core) - Abstract/Summary
Over the past years, the Computational Core has successfully completed multiple large-scale bioinformatics
software development and data generation/analysis projects and built an extensible computational infrastructure
to accommodate various computational needs. The experience acquired, the software base built, and the
infrastructure developed can be leveraged to provide effective and high-quality computational support to all P01
Project teams.
Aim 1 will build an integration/analysis hub to gather public data for the prosecution of in silico studies that are
complementary or in addition to those that Project investigators conduct in their respective groups.
Computational Core supports P01 researchers in the common goal of defining and validating
signatures/biomarkers predicting the reliance of PDAC on alternative pathways or regulatory networks
responsible for tumor growth – particularly in the context of facile comparison to external data. In silico external
data validation has the advantage of being able to scan the available large data sets to seek for quick answers
that would otherwise require commitment of both time and money to accomplish.
Aim 2 focuses on high-quality cancer genomic data analysis. We will provide support to P01 investigators in
statistical analysis on genomic and transcriptomic data to identify differentially expressed genes between cell
populations, genomic groups, disease subtypes, or treatment conditions for biomarker discovery. To better
support the increasing need of tumor microenvironment (TME) research, we implemented advanced analytic
approaches on bulk and single-cell RNA data for biomarker discovery, immuno-clustering, and cancer driving
feature identification. Combining insights from single-cell analysis and bulk sequencing data will greatly help the
advance of cancer immunotherapy research.
Aim 3 will enable P01 investigators to perform genomic characterization using next generation sequencing
technology by leveraging our existing pipeline. We have built a production level NGS data processing and
analysis pipeline that has been used intensively for internal projects and collaborative research. The automated
pipeline can also be used to support the NGS related efforts of P01 Projects 1, 2 and 3 to maintain high quality
and standards.
In summary, the Computational Core is an experienced team with proven records of analytical innovation in
response to scientific needs. We expect that technologies and analytical approaches relevant to P01 Projects
will continue to evolve rapidly and new opportunities will arise. The Computational Core will keep providing P01
investigators with the needed expertise and infrastructure critical to conducting the proposed research."

10862541,"The overall mission of this research program is to define how pulmonary Mesenchymal Vascular
Progenitor Depletion Promotes Lung Aging and Susceptibility to Emphysema. Loss of epithelial progenitor cell
function is a unifying factor in accelerated lung aging, and the development of emphysema. However, equally as
important but poorly understood, there is a gap in our understanding of mesenchymal vascular progenitors
(MVPC) in these processes. This proposal is significant as it attempts to fill in a number of important gaps
surrounding how dysfunction of the MVPC progenitor population, contributes to aging and increased
susceptibility to emphysema via regulation of vascular remodeling and loss of angiostasis. Analysis of the MVPC
- lung niche interactions provide a target rich environment to identify nuances in MVPC progenitor dependent
pathways relevant to the pathobiology of Angiostasis, Aging and Emphysema, as well as the potential to identify
therapeutics to restore tissue function. We propose three focus areas for our research based on complementary
themes. Theme 1 Regulation of MVPC function in healthy and aged lung: we will use our unique in vivo and in
vitro model systems to identify how MVPC function and adaptive angiogenesis is regulated during tissue
homeostasis and aging. Theme 2 Consequence of MVPC Loss of Function in healthy, aged and cigarette smoke
exposed lung: we will show that loss of MVPC function, by depletion or altered signaling, drives vasculopathy
and subsequent lung aging and emphysema. Theme 3 Therapeutic Rescue of MVPC function in aged and
cigarette smoke exposed lung: we will validate the use of MVPC and repurposing of FDA approved paquinimod
to restore MVPC numbers and function, subsequent tissue function and establish time frames for intervention.
Positive results from these studies are readily translatable. We will leverage our strong collaborations, at National
Jewish, University of Colorado as well as internationally recognized collaborators provide a basic and
translational understanding of the mechanisms regulating MVPC function and differentiation at the single cell
level as well as how they regulate their niche and lung microenvironment. We will also define whether progenitor
rescue with MVPC cell therapy or interventional treatment will restore lung structure and function."
10836255,"Project Summary: This is a proposal to renew the Levy lab MIRA. Fundamental cell biological questions
concern the regulation of organelle morphology. In particular, nuclear morphology is often altered in cancer
cells in a ploidy-independent manner, a change used for cancer diagnosis and staging. It is not known if
cancer-related changes in nuclear morphology are a cause or consequence of disease due to a gap in our
knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate nuclear morphology. In broad terms, our research focuses on
uncovering fundamental and conserved mechanisms that regulate nuclear size and shape. Since 2018,
my lab has published 10 research papers and 8 reviews/protocols that have advanced goals from the previous
MIRA and that lay the groundwork for the current proposal. Whereas our past studies relied on biochemically
tractable Xenopus egg extracts that reconstitute nuclear assembly, we are now exploring new areas and
developing complementary approaches, including microfluidic-encapsulation of extract, the use of actin-intact
and cycling extracts, in vivo developmental studies in sea urchin and Xenopus embryos, differentiation studies
using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and collaborative work in C. elegans. We will address
four questions over the next 5 years. (1) What mechanisms control nuclear size and shape under normal
and stress conditions? Following up on our imaging-based RNAi screen, we will dissect novel mechanisms of
nuclear morphology control using Xenopus egg extracts and Xenopus and sea urchin embryos, focusing on
cancer-relevant hits. We will also investigate how osmotic, oxidative, and proteotoxic stress influence nuclear
morphology. (2) How do cytoplasmic volume and shape influence organelle morphology and positioning?
Using a bottom-up microfluidic approach, we will generate synthetic cells with increasingly complex and native
attributes to address questions at the intersection of size control, cytoskeletal organization, and cell cycle
timing; these experiments will be complemented by in vivo studies in sea urchin embryos. (3) How is nuclear
morphology regulated during development and differentiation? Leveraging new mechanistic insights, we will
investigate how nuclear morphology affects embryonic development. Using iPSCs, we found that nuclear
morphology and lamin dynamics change significantly during differentiation, motivating our future work to
uncover the underlying mechanisms for these effects. (4) How is nuclear identity determined in a multinucleate
syncytium? In new collaborative work, we will investigate transcriptional coordination and specialization in the
multinucleate C. elegans hypodermis. Our work is bolstered by ongoing productive collaborations that use
diverse interdisciplinary techniques including high-resolution microscopy, RNAi screening, microfluidics and
microfabrication, and multi-omics approaches. Our overall vision is to use the mechanistic knowledge
gained to address how nuclear morphology affects cell and nuclear function, including nuclear

Due to population ageing, heart failure (HF) is reaching pandemic proportions and is now the most common
hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. HF carries an unfavorable prognosis,
with both 6-month hospital readmissions and 5-year mortality rates reaching 50%. To improve clinical
outcomes, it is critical that patients implement adequate self-care, i.e., they adhere to pharmacological and
lifestyle recommendations and monitor their symptoms to ensure they receive medical attention in a timely
fashion. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects up to two-thirds of patients with HF and is a key barrier to their
ability to effectively implement self-care. Despite its negative impact on self-care and on clinical outcomes, only
a small number of self-care intervention studies specifically address MCI and interventions targeting this
important comorbidity are sorely needed. There is preliminary evidence that mindfulness training (MT) can
improve cognitive function in individuals with MCI. MT has also been shown to improve interoceptive
awareness, a skill which could increase the patient’s ability to recognize worsening of HF symptoms in a timely
fashion, receive treatment sooner, and potentially prevent re-admissions. Finally, by eliciting the relaxation
response, MT enhances vagal control, which has been associated with better cognitive function. This
application, designed in response to PAR-20-180 “Identifying innovative mechanisms or interventions that
target multimorbidity and its consequences” and in line with NIA interests, will leverage our expertise with
remote MT for patients with chronic conditions to conduct a phase II mechanistic RCT with the following
objectives: a) To study the effects of MT on cognitive function and interoceptive awareness in patients with co-
morbid MCI and HF, b) To assess whether improvements in these proximal factors could positively impact self-
care and c) To study the underlying physiological mechanisms by which MT could improve cognition in this
population. Stable outpatients (n=176) with HF and MCI will be randomly assigned to phone-delivered MT (a
weekly, 30-minute session for 8 weeks integrated with a 20-min guided daily individual practice via digital
recordings) plus enhanced usual care (EUC) or to EUC alone. Consistent with current recommendations, usual
care will be enhanced in both groups with self-care education materials. At baseline, 3 months (end of
treatment), and 9 months since baseline participants will undergo comprehensive assessments of cognitive
function, interoceptive awareness, HF self-care and other psycho-behavioral factors, cardiac vagal control, and
HF biomarkers. This is the first rigorous investigation of the effects of MT on cognitive function, interoceptive
awareness, and self-care in patients with co-morbid MCI and HF. Demonstrating that, by improving cognitive
performance and interoceptive awareness, MT promotes self-care in patients with co-morbid HF and MCI will
pave the way to the integration of MT into rehabilitation programs and self-care interventions to improve clinical
outcomes in this vulnerable population."

While four medications for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), many patients do not benefit from them. Moreover, while genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of
alcohol consumption and problematic alcohol use (PAU; i.e., a phenotype that combines AUD diagnoses and a
measure of harmful drinking) have yielded many significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect
risk, these have yielded few drug targets for treating AUD. Hence, there is an unmet need to identify drug targets
for the development of novel and/or repurposed drugs to treat AUD. Recent research indicates that targeting
disease mechanisms with genetic support can increase the success rate in drug development and that modules
(i.e., biological networks surrounding disease-associated genes) are enriched for targets of approved drugs.
Thus, genes affecting alcohol consumption and risk of PAU and their associated modules could yield new targets
and drugs for therapeutic repurposing. Furthermore, the availability of large electronic health records (EHR)
datasets makes it possible to explore whether exposure to FDA-approved drugs can lead to improvements in
medical conditions other than the ones for which they are approved, such as AUD, and potentially be repurposed.
This proposal will build upon prior work by the study team and leverage advances in genomics and access to
the Veterans Affairs (VA) EHR through the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) to: 1) elucidate
modules linked to alcohol consumption and PAU (Aims 1 and 3); and 2) identify promising drugs for repurposing
to treat AUD (Aim 2). The general hypotheses for Aims 1-2 are: 1) the genes implicated in the identified modules
will be targeted by numerous approved drugs; and 2) of the drugs with sufficient patient data in the VA EHR,
there will be evidence that they reduce alcohol consumption in propensity score analyses. The hypothesis for
Aim 3 is that the analysis will identify top ranked modules that are enriched for biological processes with
relevance to alcohol consumption and PAU. In sum, this proposal combines psychiatric genetic and
pharmacoepidemiologic methods to identify novel targets and evaluate promising drugs to be repurposed for
treating AUD. An atheoretical, genetic data-driven approach to selecting promising FDA-approved drugs and
then testing them in the EHR using propensity score methods has not previously been done in psychiatry,
including for AUD. This project is made possible by recent advances in GWAS of alcohol consumption and PAU,
drug target linking, and the cultivation of EHRs for genetic and other analyses. This approach to drug prioritization
could uncover unique drugs to be tested in follow-up clinical trials and novel targets to be evaluated in preclinical
studies."
10851696,"Abstract
Yoga has been shown to have consistent but modest effects in reducing pain and improving function in
populations with chronic low back pain (CLBP) in multiple randomized controlled trials. Reviews and practice
guidelines support yoga as an evidence-based treatment for CLBP with at least moderate benefit and yoga is
being increasingly applied as an integrative therapy. However, the mechanisms through which yoga exerts
clinical improvements on pain severity and interference have not been identified; such identification might lead
to optimizing yoga interventions to improve their potency. To identify underlying mechanisms associated with
yoga interventions (PA 18-323) and based on a comprehensive theoretical emotion regulation model of yoga
developed by the PI, we aim to test emotion regulation as a primary mechanism of yoga's effects, and to test
biological pathways through which yoga's effects on increased adaptive emotion regulation may operate to
affect pain-related functioning. Emotions strongly influence perceptions of pain intensity and predict disability,
particularly among individuals with CLBP, and interventions that promote emotion regulation skills have been
shown to reduce pain. Increasing evidence demonstrates that consistent yoga practice can promote improved
emotion regulation, but research has not yet tested whether the effects of yoga practice on CLBP are due to
improvements in emotion regulation. To examine this issue, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of
204 people with CLBP assessed pre-intervention, 6 weeks, post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up
to test the impact of a yoga intervention on emotion regulation relative to stretching/strengthening without
meditation or breathwork. Secondarily, we will also assess whether yoga's effects on CLBP (improved pain
severity and functioning) are mediated by changes in emotion regulation. We also examine whether the link
between emotion regulation and pain severity and functioning is moderated or mediated by pain sensitization,
effects that have been theorized and/or demonstrated to account for changes in pain, thereby testing emotion
regulation as a key mechanism underlying the clinical effects of yoga on CLBP."
10851699,"There is a major need for new therapeutic strategies that target Kras in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) which has a dismal 5% survival rate. However, over 3 decades of work has failed to develop
effective therapeutics against Kras or other mutant Ras isoforms (Hras, Nras), which account for
approximately 30% of all human cancers. Recent published work in our laboratory revealed that
mutationally activated Kras drives its own protein synthesis using a positive feedforward mechanism and
the unique translation elongation factors eIF5A1. In fact, Kras drives increased eIF5A1 expression which
in turns drives increased in Kras translation and downstream signaling, leading to increased cell
proliferation and migration. More recently, we tested the ability of the highly related isoform eIF5A2 to
regulate this pathway. Surprisingly, we discovered that eIF5A2 does not regulated Kras expression nor
does it regulate PDAC cell growth, but rather it plays a unique role in regulating invadopodia formation
and metastasis, which operates independent of eIF5A1. The identification that eIF5A2 mediates
invadopodium formation and metastasis is an important breakthrough because it provides a new therapeutic
strategy to target metastatic PDAC, which is sorely needed. In fact, unlike eIF5A1, which is ubiquitously
expressed in tissues, eIF5A2 expression is restricted to brain and testis, but is selectively upregulated in
malignant PDAC tissues and metastases making it an ideal biomarker and therapeutic target. Therefore,
work outlined in this proposal will test the hypothesis that eIF5A2 regulates localized translation of mRNAs
encoding key metastatic proteins that drive PDAC cell invasion and metastasis using the clinically relevant,
immune competent, KCP mouse model of PDAC metastasis. The proposed work is important because the
mechanisms that regulate mRNA translation in the invadopodium are poorly understood in general and
have not been investigated in PDAC. A detailed understanding of this process could reveal new strategies
and targets to modulate eIF5A2 protein expression, invadopodium formation, and PDAC metastasis. Such
an approach is sorely needed for development of new and existing therapeutics to fight this deadly disease.
Specific Aim 1. To determine the role of 5A2 in mediating 5A2, erbB2, PDGFR-b, and PEAK1 mRNA
localization, translation, and signaling in invadopodium formation and cancer cell invasion.
Specific Aim 2. To determine the role of 5A2 in mediating PDAC tumor formation and metastasis."

10838569,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include deposition of Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregates in neurofibrillary tangles. These aggregates have been
demonstrated to activate inflammasome signaling. Inflammasomes are innate immune platforms implicated in
numerous chronic neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions such as AD. Inflammasome inhibition is being
explored as a therapeutic strategy for AD and other complex neuroinflammatory/degenerative disorders including
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Recent studies have
identified links between dysregulation of transposable elements (TEs) and AD. We have established a critical
mechanistic role for activity of one class of TEs – short interspersed elements (SINEs) – in the pathogenesis of
AMD. We have demonstrated that SINE RNA accumulation induces cellular degeneration in AMD by dual
activation of the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes. Furthermore, we have identified DDX17, an RNA helicase,
as the molecular sensor of SINE RNAs that licenses dual activation of the inflammasomes. Moreover, our
preliminary studies have identified dysregulation of SINE RNAs in spatial proximity to Aβ deposits in the 5xFAD
model of AD and that a novel small molecule inhibitor of NLRC4-NLRP3 signaling suppresses inflammasome
activation induced by Aβ aggregates.
Notwithstanding these findings, major gaps in knowledge about SINE RNAs and inflammasomes in AD persist,
e.g, the cellular sources of SINE RNAs in AD are undefined and whether SINE RNAs interact with and activate
inflammasome components in AD is unknown. This proposal will test the hypothesis that AD pathology is
exacerbated by NLRP3/NLRC4 activation induced by endogenous SINE RNA accumulation. We will test this
hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) We will quantitate SINE RNA expression and inflammasome activation and
map their cellular origins in the 5xFAD model of AD; 2) We will determine the cellular mechanisms of SINE RNA-
induced inflammasome activation in brain microglia, whether SINE RNA compromises Aβ phagocytosis by
microglia, and whether inflammasome inhibitors improve Aβ phagocytosis; and 3) We will test the effects of
individual and dual inflammasome inhibitors on Aβ clearance as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in the
5xFAD model. Collectively, these thematically related but independent aims will shed light on the contribution of
SINE RNAs-induced inflammasome activation in AD. This project is responsive to RFA-AG-22-021 as it will (a)
define the functional roles and causal relationships between SINE RNAs and neuroinflammation; (b) define the
mechanisms underpinning innate and immune responses to SINE RNAs; and (c) test therapeutic interventions
interfering with SINE RNA-mediated molecular pathways. These studies will provide a deeper mechanistic
understanding of the role of TEs that can serve as a foundation for future translational research."
10838466,"PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) is a highly heritable, complex reproductive and metabolic disorder affecting up to 15% of reproductive-age women worldwide. The etiology of PCOS remains unknown so the diagnostic criteria, e.g. NIH and Rotter-dam, are based on expert opinion rather than on knowledge of disease mechanisms. Our recent meta-analysis of genomewide association studies (GWAS) of European (EA) ancestry cases found that the genetic architecture
of PCOS defined by the different diagnostic criteria was generally similar. This finding suggests that these criteria
do not identify biologically distinct disease subtypes. In contrast, using unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis
in EA PCOS, we identified two PCOS subtypes: a “reproductive” group characterized by higher luteinizing hor-mone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels with relatively low BMI and insulin levels; and a
“metabolic” group characterized by higher BMI as well as glucose and insulin levels with relatively low SHBG
and LH levels. We replicated these subtypes in an additional EA PCOS cohort. We performed GWAS with the
subtypes and found six novel loci at genomewide significance, five loci associated with the reproductive subtype
and one locus associated with the metabolic subtype. Further, the effect sizes for these loci were substantially
greater than those GWAS loci associated with PCOS diagnosis by the existing criteria. We have exciting pre-liminary data that these subtypes are present in PCOS cases of African American (AA), Hispanic (HA) and East
Asian (Korean, KA) ancestry. Our overarching hypothesis is that there are phenotypic subtypes of PCOS with
distinct genetic architecture. We will: (1) Test the hypothesis that there are subtypes of PCOS in additional EA
cohorts of phenotypically diverse PCOS and assess the genetic architecture of these subtypes. We will perform
unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of reproductive and metabolic quantitative traits in additional EA an-cestry PCOS case-control cohorts. We will formally assess differences in genetic architecture and conduct fine-mapping of GWAS data to select variants for Aim 3 functional studies. (2) Test the hypothesis that subtypes are
present in PCOS of African, Hispanic and East Asian ancestry and assess the genetic architecture of these
subtypes. Cluster analysis, GWAS with subtypes, assessment of genetic architecture and fine-mapping will be
performed as in Aim 1 in AA, HA and KA PCOS case-control cohorts. Transethnic meta-analysis will be con-ducted to leverage differences in ancestry for gene discovery. (3) Test the hypothesis that high priority variants
associated with PCOS subtypes are functional in tissues relevant to disease pathogenesis. We will identify the
noncoding genetic variants from Aims 1 and 2 causing the genetic association signals with a high-throughput
reporter assay we developed in human theca, granulosa and preadipocyte cell lines. The genes impacted will
be investigated using CRISPR/Cas9-based assays. This research will have a sustained and lasting impact on
the field by defining biologically relevant subtypes of PCOS and identifying causal variants in key pathways
related to PCOS pathogenesis in diverse populations."
10860588,"Project Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in radiation oncology for tasks such as image
reconstruction and registration, autosegmentation, synthetic CT generation, and treatment planning. However,
AI design fundamentally challenges existing quality assurance (QA) paradigms which imperils the quality and
safety of AI for clinical use. Addressing the unmet need of QA for clinical AI is critical as the potential for
performance degradation of AI systems in the clinic is high. Domain shift - when the distribution of data used
during training is different from the distribution of data encountered during deployment - is a critical problem that
can lead to significant errors in AI performance. This is a common occurrence in clinical environments, where
scanner performance varies over time due to changes in imaging protocols or sequences, equipment
degradation, or replacement with a different make or model. Monitoring clinical AI system performance for signs
of domain shift is of utmost importance to ensure safe and high-quality use. Development of robust QA tools and
practices to verify and monitor the performance of AI systems is therefore critical as these systems enter the
clinical arena. In this project, we will develop a new type of QA approach amenable for closed-source, clinical AI
systems. Our approach supported by our preliminary data is to design a series of detectors which monitor the
input imaging data and AI system output for changes and link these changes to an actionable tolerance through
a prediction model, without the need to access the AI system internals. Our overall hypothesis is that the
expected performance of clinical AI systems is predicted within 5% error by monitoring only the AI system inputs
and outputs. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a QA framework for AI systems which were trained with a ground
truth set of labels, using autosegmentation as a model system. We will build compression algorithms to encode
features from the distribution of inputs (images) and separately on the distribution of outputs (contours). A
prediction model taking these distributions as input and predicting the contour accuracy will be built. We will
develop the QA framework on a set of existing AI systems including two commercial AI and several in-house
autosegmentation algorithms. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on AI systems which do not use a ground truth
during training, using synthetic CT generation as a model system. A similar approach as in SA1 using
compression to build distributions of input and output latent features will be used. Instead of predicting accuracy
(which requires a ground truth), we will develop a model to monitor the distribution of outputs. In Specific Aim 3,
we will deploy our quality assurance frameworks in a prospective clinical study involving multiple institutions and
evaluate effectiveness in ensuring the safe and high-quality deployment of clinical AI systems. We will also share
our frameworks and data with the broader community to promote best practices in AI quality assurance. We
expect that our QA framework will significantly improve the safety and effectiveness of clinical AI systems in
radiation oncology, by ensuring that these systems are robust to domain shift and other sources of error."
10859739,"Abstract: Phantom sound perception (tinnitus) arises from aberrant central auditory pathways. Subjective
tinnitus is typically caused by hearing loss. Auditory cortex (AC) in tinnitus animal models exhibits increased
spontaneous neural firing and synchrony. Another subset of tinnitus exists whereby patients (80%) can
manipulate pitch, tone and/or volume of tinnitus with head and neck/jaw movements. Termed somatic or
somatosensory tinnitus (ST), this modulable form of phantom sound perception is associated with cortical &
subcortical plasticity. Somatosensory/trigeminal neural inputs to auditory brainstem and cortex likely underlie
ST etiology & maintenance. Thus, two forms of subjective tinnitus exist; 1. non-somatic tinnitus (non-ST;
hearing loss etiology) 2. somatic (somatosensory /trigeminal etiology).
Our group was the first to report equivalent objective neural correlates in human, non-ST, using non-invasive
brain imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). In our completed R21 we successfully
validated an adapted fNIRS probe for the external auditory canal (EAC). Our unique design that was coupled
with traditional scalp fNIRS probes, passes NIR light into ventral AC to measure hemodynamic responses
(HRs), resting state functional neural connectivity (RSFC). We replicated predictable/published increases in AC
HRs during silence in non-ST participants that is suppressed with sound stimulation. These objective
correlates of non-ST in humans have not been evaluated in ST.
Knowledge gaps in both non-ST & ST include: 1. Do objective changes in AC HRs & RSFC in non-ST tinnitus
relate to tinnitus severity? 2. Does ST both at rest & during a somatic maneuver /somatosensory stimulation
yield objective changes in AC HRs and RSFC? 3. Can objective neural correlates from non-ST & ST be used
to construct predictive modeling/machine learning to distinguish these two forms of subjective tinnitus?
Our central hypothesis is that human non-ST & ST will reveal objective measurable patterns of AC
activity (HRs) & connectivity (RSFC) that is tinnitus severity specific that can be discerned with
machine learning algorithms: We will investigate HRs and RSFC in subjective (AIM 1) and somatic (AIM 2)
tinnitus variants. The data from these two AIMS will be considered with several tinnitus indices/questionnaires
to determine how objective brain responses in tinnitus potentially correlate with tinnitus severity. Data
generated from AIMS 1 and 2 will then provide the necessary information to build machine learning algorithms
that can then be used to predict HR and RSFC in human subjects going forward as a clinical and research tool.
Based on subjective severity and modulation properties, the goal of this AIM is to establish predictive neural
maps that may begin to individualize underlying properties of pathology that may be variant from participant to
participant. In the age of personalized medicine, this will be an important contribution to identify disease
nuance that may help target or direct therapies appropriately."
10859763,"ABSTRACT
Although not pleasant, frustration is an important state, as it acts as a check on aberrant motivation. Conditions
of high motivation (e.g. substance use disorders [SUDs]) can arise when frustration fails to decrease
motivation (i.e. inelasticity of demand). We have developed a way of measuring frustration-related behavior
during operant responding in rats by looking at barpress durations. Having satisfied 9 fundamental criteria for
determining barpress durations as a measure of frustration-related behavior, the current project will determine
fundamental neurobiological aspects of frustration as it relates to decreased motivation for drug. We
hypothesize that individual differences in motivation are determined in part by frustration, with frustration
having distinct early life environmental determinants and specific neurocircuitry converging on motivation
pathways. We contend that frustration is distinguishable from drug motivation and plays an important role in
attenuating motivation for drug. Many suffering from SUDs are insensitive to frustration, meaning that
frustrating conditions do not decrease motivation appropriately. This project will utilize two well-characterized
rat behavioral tests for drug motivation, namely behavioral economic assessment of demand elasticity and
progressive ratio determination of drug value. The project will address key aspects of 1) early-life factors
conferring individual differences in frustration behavior as determinants of susceptibility and resilience to drug
motivation, 2) the role of key frustration-related neurocircuitry projecting to the shell of the nucleus accumbens
(shNAc), and 3) effects on shNAc medium spiny neuron output on frustration and motivation behavior. Thus,
Aim 1 of this project will investigate the development of individual differences in frustration-related behavior
subsequent to adolescent exposure to risk/resilience factors such as chronic unpredictable mild stress and
environmental enrichment/isolation, each known to affect motivation for drug. The question is whether the
already known effects on motivation are mediated through frustration. Additionally, chronic frustration during
adolescence will assess whether this manipulation inoculates against, or predisposes to, later sensitivity to
frustration as it affects drug motivation. Aim 2 will utilize a combinatorial chemogenetic approach for
manipulating four specific pathways for frustration and/or motivation to discern the circuitry integration of
frustration with motivation to affect behavior. Aim 3 will assess effects of frustration on shNAc output neurons
and the effects of shNAc output on motivation for drug. To be clear, the proposed therapeutic strategy is not
high frustration itself, but rather normalizing the ability for frustration to check drug motivation. Understanding
the neurobiology of frustration-attenuated motivation is the first major step in developing this novel approach."
10859764,"Abstract:
Close HLA matching of kidney donors to their recipients plays a vital role in graft survival. However,
prioritizing antigen-level HLA matching in US deceased donor allocation leads to racial disparities in access to
well-matched donors. Only 3.04% of transplants to Black recipients between 2000 and 2017 were the lowest-
risk 0-ABDR antigen mismatch, compared to 13.95% for Whites. Recent advances in precision
histocompatibility testing have improved alloimmune risk stratification for kidney transplants, and prioritizing
low molecular mismatch instead of low antigen mismatch could significantly increase graft survival. Molecular
mismatch better identifies high-risk recipients who have much greater odds of developing new dnDSA (HR:
23) and antibody-mediated rejection (HR: 5) compared to low-risk recipients. While molecular HLA matching
increases graft survival, the impact of prioritizing molecular mismatch in US deceased donor kidney allocation,
including the number of years of additional graft life and whether such matching might have disparate impacts
by race, ethnicity, or gender is unknown. The preferred molecular matching paradigm, and whether to
prioritize more moderate or fewer exceptional donor/recipient matches remain uncertain.
We will use a detailed simulation to project impacts of prioritizing molecular-level rather than antigen-level
matching, while adjusting candidates’ allocation score by our novel metric, personalized immunologic
compatibility likelihood (PICL). The PICL adjustment aims to balance the biological difficulty in finding well-
matched donors, similar to the current adjustment performed to account for the candidates’ sensitization level
(CPRA). While HLA genotyping to measure molecular mismatch isn't standard practice for donors and
recipients currently, the technology is expected to be available within the next 2-3 years. Using our high-
resolution HLA genotyping dataset, derived from a pool of over 2.77 million stem cell donors across seven US
racial/ethnic groups, we will create simulated pools of waitlist candidates and donors and compute each
candidate's PICL. We have the following aims:
(1) Estimate graft survival benefits of prioritizing molecular HLA matching prioritization in the US deceased
donor kidney allocation, augmenting existing simulation tools to model molecular matching. (2) Develop a
personalized immunologic compatibility likelihood (PICL) metric, and measure antigen/molecular match
likelihood distributions across candidate racial groups, to characterize inequities in the probability of finding a
well-matched donor in the US deceased donor pool. (3) Incorporate PICL into deceased donor allocation to
promote equity, using simulation optimization algorithms to design a points system that increases graft
survival and mitigates disparities in the transplant rate and the rate of well-matched transplants."
10831528,"SUMMARY
The surface of mammalian cells contains many important proteins including receptors and transporters. They
regulate numerous cellular events, such as sensing extracellular nutrients, and initiating cell signaling.
Frequently, these proteins do not work independently, but cooperate with one another instead to fulfill the tasks.
Aberrant protein interactions on the cell surface will impact protein activities and result in human diseases such
as cancer. Therefore, it is not sufficient to identify and quantify surface proteins. Systematic investigation of
surface protein interactions can aid in an in-depth understanding of protein functions and cellular activities, and
provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. However, it is extraordinarily challenging to
comprehensively analyze protein interactions only on the cell surface. The objective of this project is to develop
innovative and effective methods to globally analyze protein interactions on the cell surface, especially direct
interactions among low-abundance surface proteins, and apply the methods to study surface proteins and their
interaction changes during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Guided by strong preliminary data,
this objective will be fulfilled by pursuing three specific aims. 1) Effective MS-based methods for global analysis
of protein interactions on the cell surface. Through the development of the innovative methods, surface protein
interactors will be systematically analyzed. The cleavable cross-linker with a chemical handle will allow for
selective enrichment of cross-linked peptides, which will enable us to identify many more direct interactions
among low-abundance surface proteins. Furthermore, integrating cleavable detergents into the workflow will
increase the coverage of membrane proteins on the cell surface. 2) Radical chemistry-based methods to tag
surface proteins for studying their interactions. Based on the fact that the cell surface is covered with glycans,
radicals will be generated through the enzymatic oxidation of glycans, and they will be used to quickly tag surface
proteins. Radical chemistry-based methods will further increase the coverage of surface proteins and their
interactions. More comprehensive analysis of surface proteins and their interactions on the cell surface will be
achieved. 3) Quantification of surface glycoproteins and the surface protein interaction remodeling during the
EMT. During the EMT, the properties of cells change dramatically, such as cell morphology, cell-cell interactions,
and cell mobility, which are often determined by surface proteins. The proposed methods will be applied to
comprehensively analyze surface glycoproteins and the surface protein interaction network remodeling during
the EMT. The results will unveil the molecular mechanisms of the EMT and the EMT-relevant diseases. Without
sample restrictions, the proposed methods can be extensively applied to study surface protein interactions,
leading to the identification of surface proteins as disease biomarkers and drug targets."

 The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective,
injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a
favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a
deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has
drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical,
thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of
regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that
we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative
Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with
rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research
& Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific
knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This
proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the
initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six
specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive
the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose
rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of
regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned
investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a
pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4)
Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation
programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees,
investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our
program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim).
Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and
detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the
reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort
the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.

 HIV-1/AIDS is a devastating immunodeficiency disease that has resulted in over 35 million deaths
across the globe. There is a compelling ongoing need to develop novel treatment strategies to combat the
continuing emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. A drug target that has not yet been successfully brought to
the clinic is the interaction of the Gag protein with its RNA genome to form the viral ribonucleoprotein complex,
which initiates the process of virion assembly. A deeper understanding of the biochemical and biophysical
interactions that drive viral ribonucleoprotein complex formation is needed to advance further therapeutic
development. Based on recent findings that viral ribonucleoprotein complexes undergo liquid-liquid phase
separation to form biomolecular condensates, this proposal explores the molecular underpinnings of Gag-viral
RNA interactions. We have assembled an accomplished interdisciplinary team of scientists to work at the
crossroads of retrovirology, RNA biology, biophysics, and pharmacology to shed light on our understanding of
viral and cellular biomolecular condensates in HIV-1 infection.
 Our preliminary results suggesting that HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes form in the nucleus inspired
this provocative proposal to investigate the interplay of virus replication machinery with nuclear bodies that
form biomolecular condensates. In the R21 phase, we will use innovative methods involving biophysics,
genetics, state-of-the-art live cell imaging, and targeted pharmacological interventions to examine whether
HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes assemble into biomolecular condensates in the nucleus. In the R33 phase,
we will extend these studies to probe mechanistic questions focusing on whether nuclear BMCs play critical
roles in regulating HIV-1 transcription, latency reactivation, and genomic RNA packaging. Due to the high
incidence of substance use disorder in people with HIV-1/AIDS, we will also investigate whether drugs of
abuse influence HIV-1 nuclear biomolecular condensates. Elucidating the genetic determinants of HIV-1
condensate formation could lead to the identification of novel drug targets to treat HIV/AIDS."

The neurological consequences of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) are a critical issue facing our
Veterans. The effects of TBI-induced cognitive deficits can be devastating, yet little is known about the
neuropathological progression initiated by potentially unique injury mechanisms caused by blast exposure.
Indeed, TBI may initiate a continuum of neurodegenerative changes progressing for weeks, months, or even
years following injury; however, the relationship between various genetic backgrounds and susceptibility or
resilience to blast-induced neuropathological sequelae has not been established. The objective of the current
proposal is to address this gap in knowledge, and is in response to the recent Request for Applications on
“Genomic analysis of blast tube induced TBI in mice”. We propose to conduct a comparative study of the effect
of and recovery from blast tube induced injury in eight strains of mice (A/J, C57Bl/6J, 129S1/SvlmJ, NOD/LtJ,
NZO/HiLtJ, Ast/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ) that capture more than 90% of the genetic variation in commonly
used laboratory mice. While the major objective is to establish relationships between underlying genetic
profiles and neurobehavioral and neuropathological consequences of blast exposure, a detailed assessment of
multi-organ pathology will also be performed. First, we will establish lethality exposure thresholds and the
extent and nature of multi-organ pathology for each strain (Aim 1). Then we will use a multi-dimensional battery
of behavioral testing to determine the extent of cognitive and motor deficits for each strain up to 1 month
following blast exposure (Aim 2). Next, at discrete time points post-blast we will execute in-depth quantitative
analyses of gene expression changes measuring hundreds of relevant genes and neuropathological sequelae
using traditional immunohistochemistry as well as cutting-edge imaging mass spectrometry capable of
quantifying levels of up to 37 proteins simultaneously (Aim 3). Finally, we will perform detailed statistical
testing, including principal component analysis, to identify the relative contributions of various underlying
genotypes on injury thresholds, organ pathology, behavioral deficits, gene expression, and neuropathology
resulting from blast exposure. Of note, all data sets deriving from this study will be made available to the
scientific community to provide a foundation for future analyses and formulation of data-driven hypotheses.
The current proposed research will be executed through a long-standing collaboration between experts in
conventional and blast-induced TBI spanning the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz (CMC) VA Medical Center and
the University of Pennsylvania. Overall, the execution of this comprehensive study will identify genes that
contribute to variations in susceptibility, resilience, and/or recovery from TBI, and thus will lay the foundation
for future mechanism-based studies of therapeutic agents to blunt neurodegenerative sequelae and promote
functional restoration following blast-TBI. As such, these studies will benefit the long-term health of our Veteran
population as well as enrich the overall research program at the CMC VA Medical Center."
10831381,"Gastric adenocarcinoma remains the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The vast
majority of gastric cancer evolves in the stomach in the setting of chronic atrophic gastritis usually in
association with Helicobacter pylori infection. While the role of H. pylori as the proximate cause of gastric
carcinogenesis is well established, the cellular basis of lineage changes that lead to development of
preneoplastic metaplasia and progression to cancer remain unclear. Chronic injury associated with H. pylori
infection leads to prominent changes in the composition of the gastric epithelia, with loss of parietal cells
(oxyntic atrophy), expansion of surface cells (foveolar hyperplasia) and mucous cell metaplasia. Two
metaplastic lineages are now acknowledged in the setting of oxyntic atrophy in humans: intestinal metaplasia
(characterized by the presence of intestinal goblet cells in the gastric mucosa) and Spasmolytic Polypeptide
Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM; characterized by presence of antral type mucous cells in the body of the
stomach). However, Helicobacter infection in mice leads only to SPEM. Over the past 20 years, we have
investigated the factors that lead to the development of SPEM in the face of oxyntic atrophy. Using lineage-
mapping studies in mice, we have demonstrated that SPEM arises, not from professional progenitor cells, but
from transdifferentiation of mature Mist1-expressing Chief cells into mucous cell metaplasia. All of these results
support the concept that loss of parietal cells from the gastric fundic mucosa induces the development of
SPEM from transdifferentiation of Chief cells. Since SPEM appears to be the initial pre-cancerous metaplastic
response to oxyntic atrophy, it is critical to understand how transdifferentiation of Chief cells leads to the
emergence of SPEM as the central initial event required for the development of dysplasia and neoplasia in the
stomach. During the past funding period, we have established that transdifferentiation of Chief cells into
SPEM requires an ordered series of cellular events that mediate the downscaling of zymogen granules through
autophagy and upscaling of mucous granule production to achieve mucous metaplasia. We have identified
discrete interventions that can arrest the process of transdifferentiation through inhibition of the xCT cystine
transporter or inhibition of autophagy. We have hypothesized that discrete events mediated by the 14-3-3
protein Stratifin or alterations in miR-148a are critical early triggers for initiating transdifferentiation of Chief
cells after severe gastric injury. We will therefore continue our studies of the origin of metaplasia through the
prosecution of two specific aims:!!First, we will examine the role of Stratifin in the initiation of reprogramming of
chief cells during transdifferentiation into metaplasia. We will seek to evaluate if loss of Stratifin alters the
course of transdifferentiation. In addition, we will identify the intracellular phosphoproteins in Chief cells that
are targets for Stratifin action. Second, we will determine how miR-148a regulates the initiation and
progression of transdifferentiation. We have identified miR-148a as the major miRNA expressed in Chief cells
and determined that its expression is rapidly down-regulated at the initiation of transdifferentiation. We will
examine the impact of loss of miR-148a on the expression of transcripts and proteins that may mediate
transdifferentiation. Validation studies of putative regulators will place these mediators in the context of the
discrete steps required for completion of transdifferentiation. !
All of these studies will help identify fundamental mechanisms involved in Chief cell transdifferentiation and
may lead to insights in how pre-neoplastic metaplastic lineage changes can be prevented or reversed.

10831383,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of infectious blindness
and viral encephalitis in the Western countries. Primary or recurrent infection can lead to
severe disease, yet no licensed vaccine is available. HSV typically initiates infection in
the epithelial cells of mucosa and spreads to sensory neurons where the virus
establishes latency. Reactivation from latency occurs intermittently, which is a lifelong
source for recurrent lesions. Although viral replication in the mucosa or penetration into
the nervous system inflicts damages or inflammation, the disease mechanism is less
clear. As a large DNA virus, HSV evokes antiviral responses through the innate immune
pathways that regulate TANK-binding kinase 1, a key factor required to activate cytokine
expression and autophagy in mammalian cells. Remarkably, while the interferon-
stimulated gene (STING) drives the cytokine response the tripartite motif protein 23
(TRIM23) serves to mediate autophagy. Despite such regulatory control, HSV is able to
compromise host restrictions, which depends on an HSV virulence factor γ134.5. A
central hypothesis of this proposal is that HSV differentially reprograms host immunity,
where a dynamic interplay between viral and cellular factors may determine HSV
spread, virulence and inflammation. Current effort is directed to decipher mechanisms of
HSV pathogenesis. Several aspects of HSV infection will be investigated in a multi-
faceted approach. Accordingly, recombinant HSV will be generated to determine the
nature of HSV interactions with the innate immune factors in epithelial and neuronal
cells. This will dissect elements pertinent to viral interference of the nucleic acid sensing
complexes and autophagy machineries. Furthermore, genetic studies will explore viral
features relevant to ocular replication, spread and neurovirulence. In parallel, gene
expression analysis will assesses ocular and neuoinflammation. Collectively, these
studies will provide an insight into genetic determinants of HSV virulence, which may
inform design of novel antiviral therapeutics or vaccines."
10831387,"During development and evolution, cell fate changes are guided by cell’s ability to change its transcriptional
program with posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on both proteins and chromatin. PTMs of histones have
been extensively studied as a coding system to guide alterations in cell plasticity and cell fate, such as
differentiation/programming and de-differentiation/reprogramming. The histone PTM coding system includes
phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. In parallel, PTMs of free
proteins, such as phosphorylation and acetylation of transcription factors, are also essential for organ
development and cell differentiation. These PTMs in both histones and free proteins are often catalyzed by the
same set of epigenetic enzymes, strongly suggesting a dynamic interplay of PTM coding between histones and
epigenetic and transcription factors. However, few systematic studies have been pursued to define the
functional output of PTMs as a coding system. Furthermore, the potential synergistic effect of PTMs on both
histones and free factors in cell fate changes are poorly explored. Therefore, a deep understanding of the PTM
code on both free proteins (ie. key cardiac transcription factors and epigenetic factors) and histones and how
they work together will lead to novel insights into cell fate determination and cardiac reprogramming.
 Our investigation of cardiac reprogramming uncovered a unique phosphorylation code in 14-3-3 binding
motifs (PC14-3-3). We hypothesize that activation of a phosphorylation code in 14-3-3 binding motifs triggers a
re-arrangement of protein-protein interactome among PC14-3-3 containing reprogramming factors, epigenetic
factors, and chromatin, which work synergistically in stimulating cardiac reprogramming. Specific aims:
 Aim 1: Identify the key factors containing PC14-3-3 essential for cardiac reprogramming. We will test
the hypothesis that PC14-3-3 in key reprogramming, epigenetic and histone proteins plays a critical role in
reprogramming. These studies will build a knowledge foundation of PC14-3-3 in cardiac reprogramming.
 Aim 2: Determine PC14-3-3 guided molecular mechanism in stimulating cardiac reprogramming. We
will test the hypothesis that PC14-3-3 activation triggers a protein-protein dynamic interplay among PC14-3-3
code containing reprogramming factors (Mef2c and Gata4), epigenetic factors (Hdac4 and Brg1), and histones
H3 (H3S10 and H3S28). These studies will establish PC14-3-3 directed epigenetic and chromatin landscape
changes in driving cardiac reprogramming.
 Aim 3: Examine PC14-3-3-guided cardiac reprogramming toward therapeutic applications. We will
test the hypothesis that PC14-3-3 stimulates cardiac reprogramming in human cells and clinically relevant
animal models. These studies will establish the pre-clinical application of PC14-3-3 code in cardiac
reprogramming and build a novel and efficient platform for reprogramming-mediated heart repair."

This application for the Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will facilitate the principal investigator
(PI)’s transition to independence dissecting host-microbe interactions in obesity-related metabolic diseases.
Candidate: The PI is an experimental biologist with a strong background in gut mucosal immunology and
infection biology. She did her postdoctoral training under the mentorship of Dr. Rodney Newberry, a mucosal
immunology expert. Under Dr. Newberry’s guidance, the PI demonstrated the novel role of intestinal goblet cells
in promoting immune tolerance to luminal antigens. Additionally, the PI has also demonstrated how enteric
bacteria interact with intestinal goblet cells to modulate their function. She will leverage the skills gained during
her training to characterize the dialogue between obesity-associated gut microbes and intestinal immune cells.
Career Development Plan: The PI will execute this proposal under the co-mentorship of Dr. Newberry and Dr.
Samuel Klein (a leader in the field of obesity research), advised by a team of scientific experts who also have
experience in nurturing independent investigators. Washington University provides an outstanding environment,
collaborators and cores that will foster the PI’s career development. This proposal builds on the PI’s prior
experience and fills in the gaps in her training, providing her with the tools needed for independence. It includes
the following objectives: (1) master techniques in macrophage biology (i.e., immune cell trafficking, phenotyping);
(2) developing expertise in obesity and metabolic dysfunction; (3) training in microbial ecology; (4) immersion in
bioinformatics; and (5) publishing manuscripts directly related to this proposal.
Research Plan: The scientific premise of the proposal is that gut microbiota from individuals with metabolically
unhealthy obesity (MUO) compared to metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) propel intestinal and adipose tissue
inflammation. To investigate the role of microbial drivers on the onset of metabolic syndrome, the PI has
established a model of colonizing genetically identical wildtype mice consuming a normal chow diet with stool
specimens collected from well-characterized obese or metabolically-healthy lean (MHL) human subjects with
known degrees of adipose tissue inflammation, glucose intolerance and whole-body insulin sensitivity.
Preliminary studies demonstrate that mice colonized with MUO, but not MHO or MHL donor microbiota have
glucose intolerance, higher serum insulin concentration and significant expansion of macrophages in the
intestine and adipose tissue. By completing the proposed aims, the PI will address 1) whether gut microbes from
people with MUO promote host inflammation and the onset of metabolic diseases, and 2) determine the
contribution of monocuclear phagocytes in microbiota driven-metabolic dysfunction. In completing these aims,
the PI will complement her expertise in mucosal immunology with rigorous training in macrophage biology,
microbial ecology and metabolic dysfunction to becomes an independent investigator with the long-term goal of
dissecting how microbes contribute to obesity-related metabolic disease, in alignment with the NIDDK mission."
10859424,"Abstract. Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, manifests in lung as
early onset panacinar emphysema. AAT functions to inhibit neutrophil elastase (NE) and other neutrophil
serine proteases. AAT is produced predominantly in liver and diffuses into the lung from the circulation.
Low AAT levels in AAT deficiency are associated with an imbalance between AAT and neutrophil-released
proteases allowing slow destruction of the lung parenchyma. AAT deficiency is caused by mutation in the
SERPINA1 gene; M alleles are normal alleles, Z (E342K) homozygotes account for >95% cases. Z AAT
polymerizes in hepatocytes, limiting secretion, resulting in plasma levels 10-15% of normal. AAT inhibits
serine proteases through its active site centered at methionine (M) 351 and 358. The active site
methionines are modified by oxidants including cigarette smoke, air pollutants and endogenous oxidants
from activated inflammatory cells, reducing AAT function. AAT deficiency therapy is currently treated with
weekly infusions of AAT purified from human plasma; the infused AAT normalizes lung AAT levels,
protecting alveoli from destruction. While AAT augmentation therapy reduces the rate of lung destruction,
it is susceptible to oxidation, requiring excess “reserve” AAT to protect the lung. The focus of this proposal
is to translate to humans gene therapy for AAT deficiency that circumvents both weekly requirements for
protein therapy and the susceptibility of the therapeutic AAT to oxidation inactivation. We demonstrated
that replacing M351 with valine (V) and M358 with leucine (L) on a normal M1 alanine (A)213 background
provides anti-protease protection despite oxidant stress. One-time intravenous (IV) administration to mice
of AAV8hAAT(AVL), a serotype 8 adeno-associated virus vector coding for the oxidation resistant variant
hAAT(AVL) maintains high, dose-dependent anti-protease activity in serum and lung under oxidant stress
compared with normal AAT. A toxicology study over 6 months in C57Bl/6 mice demonstrated that IV
administration of AAV8hAAT(AVL) is safe. Based on the preclinical efficacy and safety data, we propose a
phase 1 safety/dose ranging study, with IV administration of AAV8hAAT(AVL) at each of 3 doses to n=5
AAT Z homozygotes at each dose. The highest dose [2x1013 genome copies (gc)/kg] is ~ ½ log lower than
the highest dose in the toxicity study. Aim 1, R61. Prepare and submit an Investigational New Drug
package and gain approval from the FDA and other regulatory groups to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial.
Aim 2, R61. Optimize AAV8hAAT(AVL) production. Aim 3, R33. Manufacture clinical grade
AAV8hAAT(AVL) for the Phase 1 safety/dose-ranging clinical trial. Aim 4, R33. Carry out a Phase 1
safety/dose-ranging clinical trial to determine the highest tolerable dose and preliminary biologic efficacy of
AAV8hAAT(AVL) therapy for AAT deficiency."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is experienced by one-fourth of women in India and associated with poor mental,
physical, sexual and reproductive health, leading many experts including the World Health Organization to call
for the urgent development of effective primary IPV prevention. We previously developed an evidence-based,
theory-driven, dyadic intervention, Ghya Bharaari Ekatra (GBE, “Take a Flight Together,” NIH/FIC K01
TW009664) for the primary prevention of IPV among newly-married couples residing in slums in India. GBE is
delivered over six weekly sessions by a team of lay peer educators to groups of five couples, and makes use of
engaging culturally-tailored delivery methods to challenge norms and build knowledge and skills to address six
key IPV determinants: limited relationship quality time, poor self-esteem, resilience, communication and conflict
management, sexual communication and sexual/reproductive health knowledge, and conservative IPV norms
and definitions. In a pilot study of 40 couples married < 1 year, we found that GBE demonstrated high acceptance
(with 85% of participants retained across all 6 sessions), feasibility, safety (no reported adverse events), and
preliminary efficacy in preventing IPV and improving mental health in the female partner. We now seek to quantify
GBE’s impact on IPV and downstream outcomes, mental health and reproductive autonomy, examine its
mechanism of action, contexts in which it may need modification, and factors associated with its future successful
adoption and implementation. We hypothesize that (1) GBE prevents IPV experience and enhances reproductive
autonomy among women,(2) GBE improves mental health among both dyadic members, and (3) GBE’s effects
are mediated by the IPV determinants it was designed to address. Our team, with 15 years of IPV research
experience in India, proposes a cluster randomized trial of 850 newly married dyads (500 to GBE and 350
controls) in Maharashtra, India to execute the following aims: 1) to quantify the impact of the GBE intervention
compared to the ethical standard of care (information on IPV and mental and reproductive/sexual health
resources) in preventing IPV experience (primary outcome), enhancing reproductive autonomy among newly
married women (secondary outcome) and mental health among the both members of the dyad (secondary
outcome) at 12 months; 2) to conduct mediation and moderation analyses for the efficacy of the GBE
intervention; and 3) to identify barriers, facilitators, and strategies for future, successful adoption and
implementation of GBE through exit interviews with GBE participants and qualitative interviews, guided by
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, with interventionists, adopters, and other stakeholders
who have influence over implementation outcomes. Study findings will provide the information necessary to
facilitate scale-up of GBE across India and similar resource-limited, high-burden settings globally upon study
completion."

Approximately 40% of U.S. adults have obesity (BMI>30), and excess body weight is associated with at least 13
different cancers and 5% and 11% of cancer cases in men and women, respectively. Obesity disproportionately
impacts racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status (SES), and rural populations, and plays a critical role
in cancer inequities. Evidence-Based Interventions (EBIs) that address excess body weight, physical inactivity,
and poor diet are effective in promoting weight loss and reducing cancer risk, but are grossly underutilized and
there are substantial disparities in access among historically marginalized populations. Digital EBI delivery
modalities have yielded outcomes comparable to in-person programs. As such, the long-term objective of
SMARTLife Utah is to increase the reach of existing digital EBIs for obesity among racial/ethnic minority, low
SES, and rural populations in low resource healthcare settings. SMARTLife Utah will be conducted in 11
Community Health Center (CHC) systems consisting of 38 primary care clinics. SMARTLife Utah, is a hybrid
type III effectiveness – implementation design, using a pragmatic, multilevel, three phase, Sequential Multiple
Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART). SMARTLife Utah leverages ubiquitous health information technology
(HIT)/telehealth for both the implementation strategies and EBI delivery in order to address barriers for
engaging in EBIs. Implementation strategies target two different levels to increase the reach of EBIs: 1) a clinic
level HIT implementation strategy that includes enhanced system supports at point of care; and, 2) patient
level implementation strategies that provide repeated opportunities to enroll in EBIs, as well as
motivation/practical problem solving to facilitate enrollment. The scientific premise of SMARTLife Utah is
based on: 1) Evidence that EBIs for obesity are effective but underutilized, 2) Recommendations to scale up
EBI reach and reduce inequities utilizing technology based programs, 3) Data demonstrating that HIT
implementation strategies can dramatically increase engagement with EBIs and fit within existing clinical
systems, 4) Data indicating that text messaging can increase the reach of EBIs, and 5) Prior research
highlighting the effectiveness of telehealth-based patient navigation in improving the reach of EBIs.
SMARTLife Utah will provide critical data regarding the impact of pragmatic and scalable multilevel
implementation strategies designed to increase the uptake of EBIs for obesity among historically marginalized
populations low resource healthcare settings. It will also advance the field of dissemination and
implementation science by testing key constructs hypothesized to influence implementation and effectiveness
using a comprehensive conceptual framework."

The design and methods of the PRAMS project include drawing a sample from the state birth
certificate registry file and sending surveys, according to protocol, to the mothers who are selected.
The survey contains information concerning the behaviors and experiences before, during, and
shortly after the pregnancy, which is vital to determining Alabama Public Health policy and
produces timely, high quality data representative of the jurisdiction’s population to monitor risk
factors for maternal and infant health. PRAMS provides state-based data for key maternal and
child health indicators that can be tracked over time. The PRAMS team conducts comprehensive
analysis of PRAMS data based on a jurisdiction specific analysis plan designed to inform
programmatic activities, research, and public health practice. Through various reports, the team
translates and disseminates analytic results into useable information for public health action that
can guide program development and evaluation, in collaboration with the Alabama PRAMS
Steering Committee. PRAMS reports provide state-specific data on maternal behaviors and
experiences, to be used for planning and assessing perinatal health programs, and for describing
maternal experiences that may contribute to maternal and infant health. The overall goal of
PRAMS is to reduce infant morbidity and mortality, and maternal morbidity by influencing
maternal behaviors during and immediately after pregnancy."

Advanced aging is the primary factor associated with an adult diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM) with wild-type
isocitrate dehydrogenase; constituting 90% of all GBM diagnoses and the most commonly aggressive primary
brain tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Adult GBM is associated with a median overall survival (OS)
of 15 months and the prognosis significantly decreases with progressive aging. Since standard of care treatment
including maximal surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) inevitably leads
to a 100% mortality rate, immunotherapy has been proposed as a potential future approach for GBM patients,
based on its success in treating patients with other aggressive cancers. However, in contrast to the growing list
of end-stage malignancies that respond beneficially to anti-PD-1 mAb and/or anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment,
patients diagnosed with GBM and treated with immunotherapy have thus far failed to demonstrate an improved
survival among all phase III clinical trials to-date. The goal of my K02 application is therefore to define the
advanced aging-dependent increase of immunosuppressive factors that inhibit the anti-GBM immune response,
as well as to understand how aging-increased immunosuppressive indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) non-
canonically decreases the response to immunotherapy. Previous work from my group discovered that, advanced
aging increases immunosuppressive IDO1 gene expression in the normal human and mouse brain. We also
showed that, immunotherapeutic treatment combining radiotherapy (RT) with anti-PD-1 mAb and an IDO1
enzyme inhibitor, leads to a long-term (≥150 days) survival benefit in 6-12 week old immunocompetent mice with
intracranial GBM. Strikingly, the treatment was made significantly less effective at improving survival in older
subjects when engrafted the exact same tumor cells. My working hypothesis is that, advanced aging increases
immunosuppression in the CNS that limits immunosurveillance mechanisms responsible for preventing
GBM cell outgrowth and suppressing immune system responsiveness to immunotherapy. The protected
time during K02 support will allow for comprehensive aging-specific training, high-level interactions with an expert
committee of scientists that have broad experience exploring the interactions between aging, cancer, and/or the
immune response, and will provide me with the necessary time to develop competitive R01 applications to
support a future program of research focused on aging in the setting of GBM; a disease that remains incurable."

More than 750,000 individuals in the U.S. have a stroke each year, and as many as 94% of stroke survivors
exhibit reduced use of one arm, with adverse consequences for disability, caregiver burden, and quality of life.
Approximately 40%-80% of individuals who fail to use the affected arm in daily life possess adequate sensory-
motor capacity to do so. The disparity between arm use and capacity (i.e., Use/Capacity Disparity -- UCD)
occurs across a broad spectrum of sensory-motor severity and is a perplexing and urgent problem in neuro-
rehabilitation. Perhaps in part because UCD lies at the interface of sensory-motor processing and
cognitive/affective phenomena, no past research has assessed its underlying mechanisms or neuroanatomic
biomarkers. Given its prevalence, an understanding of the mechanisms of UCD across a range of severity is
required to develop targeted treatments to ameliorate the disorder. Moreover, individuals with stroke are
rarely assessed for the presence of UCD, in part because such assessment is challenging. The proposed research
will address these gaps in our knowledge and capacity by testing the predictions of 3 hypotheses of the
mechanisms underlying UCD: the sensorimotor, attention, and apathy/motivation accounts. In Aim 1 we will
administer a targeted battery of sensorimotor and neuropsychological tests to test the predictions of each of the
3 hypotheses in a sample of 100 mild to moderate left- and right-hemisphere chronic stroke patients. We will
determine the association of these measures as well as demographic and stroke-related variables with UCD.
Aim 2 will use advanced neuroimaging methods with data from resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging to develop imaging biomarkers associated with UCD. In Aim 3 we will validate a novel virtual reality
assessment tool to rapidly and reliably evaluate UCD. In addition to its clinical utility, the task enables built-in
assessment of the attention hypothesis by determining whether UCD is influenced by attentional task
demands. By the end of the grant period, we will have determined the demographic, sensorimotor,
neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical factors that predict UCD and validated a clinically-useful VR
assessment tool. Given the limited knowledge base in this area, this comprehensive research will pave the way
for development of treatments targeted to underlying mechanisms and enhanced identification of at-risk
individuals."

Chronic pain is the most prevalent, disabling, and expensive public health condition in the United
States. The goal of this project is to elucidate how to harness body’s own analgesic mechanisms
to provide pain relief. We propose to investigate 30-150 nm small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
that transport mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, and lipid mediators to recipient cells via circulation.
Uptake of sEVs induce gene expression changes in recipient cells and thus, sEVs play an
important role in intercellular communication. We observed that sEVs from RAW 264.7
macrophage cells show therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in a complete Freud adjuvant (CFA)
mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our preliminary studies show that mouse serum derived sEVs
also conferred prophylaxis when injected intrathecally in naïve recipient mice that, two weeks
later, received a hind paw injection of CFA. Thus, mice that received sEVs can remember this
stimulation for at least 2 weeks and show an attenuated response to CFA. How this long-term
memory develop is unknown. Though chronic pain is prevalent, an immunization strategy has not
yet been tested and our studies will provide the rationale and mechanistic basis for such a
strategy. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that monocyte/macrophage-derived sEV subsets
in serum are necessary and sufficient to attenuate inflammatory pain hypersensitivity and confer
prophylaxis. We will also investigate if monocyte/macrophage sEVs recruit, or promote anti-
inflammatory phenotype switching of immune cells in dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord by
quantitative immunophenotyping in situ, before and after CFA treatment. Recent studies show
that microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system can enhance or suppress
responses to a delayed secondary insult through epigenetic modifications. We hypothesize that
monocyte/macrophage-derived sEVs impart epigenetic immune memory in spinal microglia of
recipient mice, granting the capacity to attenuate pain from a future insult and contribute to the
prophylactic effect of sEVs. The studies proposed will elucidate the role of sEVs in immune
regulation and memory."

The completion of the first genome has revealed a complex pattern of recent duplications which contributes
disproportionately to human genetic variation. Our genome is particularly enriched for interspersed segmental
duplications, which harbor rapidly evolving genes and predispose our species to copy number variation and
recurrent rearrangements associated with disease. Their length, sequence identity and structural variation,
however, still complicate genome assembly and represent a major impediment to generation of telomere-to-
telomere assemblies of human genomes. The long-term objective of this research program has been to
develop computational and experimental methods to understand the organization, genetic diversity, and
disease impact of segmental duplications. The goal of this competing renewal is to apply long-read sequencing
technologies with graph-based approaches to resolve the most complex regions in hundreds of human and
ape genomes. There are four aims: (1) determine the sequence structure of these recent duplications in
humans by generating complete high-quality reference sequences by coupling orthogonal long-read
sequencing technologies; (2) understand the genetic diversity of this structure by focusing on the most
dynamic and problematic gene-rich regions in more than 350 human and a diversity of non-human ape
genomes; (3) generate matched DNA and RNA long-read data to explore the transcriptional potential and
epigenetic features of segmental duplications in the human genome; and (4) develop a graph-based genotyper
specifically optimized to assay copy number polymorphic duplicated loci in short-read whole genome sequence
data allowing their diversity to be explored more systematically. This work will provide fundamental new
insights into the structural complexity of human genomes and the mutational processes that have shaped
them. It will identify new copy-number polymorphic genes and their distribution among human populations as
well as our first assessment of how such genomic regions are regulated and lead to the emergence of new
genes. This research has the additional benefit that it will add new sequence to reference genomes, facilitate
more routine telomere-to-telomere assembly, and provide us with the ability to systematically explore genetic
variation of regions frequently overlooked as part of disease-association studies."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Heavy metal pollution has pervasive environmental, health, and evolutionary impacts. In humans, health risks of
heavy metals ranging from permanent neurological disease to increased morbidity of degenerative syndromes
are exacerbated by poverty and fragile community infrastructure. Physiological responses to heavy metals
including lead, cadmium, and copper have complex genetic architectures, and several heavy metals are known
to hinder learning and alter behavior. However, these behavioral and physiological responses to metal stress
are often considered in isolation, neglecting the specific genetic relationship between metal toxicity and
behavioral response to metal stress. My primary objective is to dissect and characterize this whole organism
heavy metal response by taking an integrative approach to examine the genetic basis of the relationship between
physiological, behavioral, and evolutionary responses to heavy metal stress. The elite genetic model Drosophila
melanogaster is ideal for my research because it shares many heavy metal-responsive genes with humans, it is
extremely facile to conduct large-scale phenotyping assays, and an enormous plethora of sophisticated tools
are available to facilitate in-depth behavioral and genomic experiments. I treat copper as my model heavy metal
because, although required at low levels for normal development and physiological function, it is a common
heavy metal pollutant that is metabolized and bioaccumulated by genes that also interact with lead, manganese,
zinc, and cadmium. With Aim 1, I will disentangle the genetic link between physiological and behavioral
responses to copper stress using a large mapping panel of genetically stable strains and combining large-scale
screens of multiple behavioral traits with physiological data collected across multiple life stages. With Aim 2, I
will characterize genetic and coevolutionary responses to copper selection in multiple populations derived from
high and low copper resistance natural populations. Aim 2 will involve an evolve and resequencing (E&R)
approach coupled with bulk RNA barcoding and sequencing (BRB-seq) to track the dynamic shifts in allele
frequencies and gene expression through the course of artificial selection for copper resistance. Investigation of
the evolutionary processes that lead to complex trait variation has great biomedical significance as we seek to
understand the gene-by-environment interactions, genetic constraints, and genetic risk factors that contribute to
increased susceptibility to toxic heavy metal exposure in human populations. This integrative approach leverages
QTL mapping, whole genome and RNA-seq, sophisticated functional validation tools available for the D.
melanogaster model system, and experimental evolution. This work will ultimately allow for the characterization
of genetic variation in chemosensory ability, traits related to decision making, and neurological function in
response to copper stress in diverse synthetic and naturally derived genetic backgrounds. Together, these
approaches will provide critical insight into the interconnectedness of multiple response traits, while also
illuminating genetic factors that influence behavioral and learning disabilities linked to metal poisoning."
10842345,"Although altered metabolism is rapidly emerging as a key feature of epilepsies, it has not been
systematically investigated in any genetic form of pediatric epilepsy. Dravet syndrome (DS), a
catastrophic childhood epilepsy associated with de novo mutations in a voltage-activated sodium
channel, Nav1.1 is one of the most common genetic epilepsies. DS patients suffer with intractable
early-life seizures, and debilitating comorbidities. Energy metabolism in comorbidities associated
with DS remain virtually unexplored. To address this unmet need, recent collaborative research
in our two laboratories revealed decreased glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates in a validated
zebrafish model of DS i.e., scn1Lab mutants. This was accompanied by downregulation of key
enzymes, pck1 and pck2, in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Here, we hypothesize that energy
disruption occurs in DS due to glucose dysregulation resulting in seizures and/or comorbidities.
The following aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if pharmacological
inhibition of pck1 and/or pck2 phenocopies metabolic and behavioral deficits in wildtype zebrafish.
Aim 2 will determine if pharmacological manipulation of pck1 and/or pck2 is therapeutic in
scn1Lab mutant zebrafish. These studies promise to provide a mechanistic explanation of the
metabolic defects observed in DS and could suggest novel avenues for therapeutic intervention."

Among Alaska Natives in Alaska, Tuberculosis (TB) remains endemic in communities and is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality. Alaska Native communities continue to have the highest rates of TB disease in the U.S.,
and most TB cases occur in villages that remain far from health centers. The approach for diagnosing TB, which
includes airlifting people with TB-related symptoms to regional centers for chest radiography and sputum
collection, is difficult and expensive to implement effectively. Through our research in TB-endemic countries, we
have identified screening and diagnostics testing modalities that are well-suited for efficient TB case finding in
remote communities of Alaska. First, portable chest x-ray devices capture digital images that can be analyzed
by computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) artificial intelligence programs for real-time interpretation. Second, as
collecting sputum specimens has been a major diagnostic barrier for community-based diagnosis, we have
recently demonstrated the high accuracy of tongue swab sampling for nucleic acid amplification testing of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) among adults in South Africa. We also have strong data, using cultured Mtb
specimens, demonstrating high accuracy on next-gen, high-throughput molecular testing systems, which have
automated processes for analyzing thousands of samples at lower costs compared to conventional lab-based
PCR systems. The objective in this application is to leverage our existing health infrastructure in south-western
Alaska, expertise in clinical TB and diagnostic testing, and strong relationships with Alaska Native communities,
to evaluate two novel community-based screening and diagnostic tools in TB-endemic regions of the United
States. Our central hypotheses are: 1) portable chest x-ray devices using CAD interpretation will be accurate
and feasible to implement in Alaska, and 2) tongue swab testing will be accurate when tested on an automated,
high-volume molecular platform, as compared to conventional sputum-based molecular testing. We will test our
hypotheses through the following two specific aims: (1) to determine if a portable, digital chest x-ray with real-
time CAD can be accurate for TB screening, and feasible for use in community settings, within TB-endemic
regions of Alaska; and (2) demonstrate the accuracy of tongue swab sampling with molecular testing using an
automated high-throughput system, compared to current sputum-based molecular testing, among adults and
children (≥5 years old) who have presumed pulmonary TB disease in Alaska. The research will be innovative by
expanding the possible tools for community-based screening and diagnostic testing in TB-endemic communities
in Alaska and elsewhere. This proposal is highly responsive to PAR-20-214, which seeks novel “Research to
Improve Native American Health.” These results will inform a subsequent clinical research trial to evaluate the
clinical impact and cost-effectiveness for conducting community-based TB screening and testing in TB-endemic
regions of Alaska."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, accounts for over 30,000 deaths each
year in the United States alone. Regrettably, current therapies provide limited clinical benefits in patients with
advanced HCC. Thus, new and more effective therapies for HCC are urgently needed. Most drug target
discoveries and validation approaches employ cell culture-based screening methods or in vivo
immunocompromised or immunodeficient mouse models (e.g., nude mice, NSG mice, etc.). However, multiple
cell culture related artifacts (e.g., 2-D culture, high concentrations of growth factors in media, etc.) and use of
immune-defective mouse models limit the rigorous identification of clinically relevant drug targets and ultimately
negatively impact their translation to clinic. To overcome these limitations and to rigorously identify novel
therapeutic targets in HCC, we combined two state-of-the-art approaches; namely an in vivo epigenome-wide
CRISPR-based functional genomics screening with a humanized mouse model with functional human immune
system. Using these systems, we identified the chromatin modifier NSD3 as a factor that promoted HCC tumor
growth and metastasis in mice with functional human immune system. Mechanistically, NSD3 loss promoted NK
cell-mediated HCC eradication and a highly-selective and efficacious inhibitor of NSD3, BI-9321, blocked HCC
tumor growth in mice with human immune system. Based on these results, we hypothesize that NSD3-mediated
suppression of NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity is necessary for the HCC tumor growth and metastasis
and targeting NSD3 represents a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating HCC. The overall objective is to
determine the in vivo role of NSD3 in driving HCC tumor growth and metastasis via suppressing NK cell-mediated
anti-tumor immunity and evaluate in vivo pharmacological targeting of NSD3 for HCC treatment. In Aim 1, we
will first determine the in vivo role of NSD3 in facilitating HCC tumor growth and metastasis. Next, we will
determine the mechanism of suppression of NK mediated anti-tumor immunity by NSD3 and its role in the
regulation of NSD3-mediated HCC tumor growth and metastasis. To answer these questions, we will use a novel
liver fibrosis model that we have developed to study HCC tumor growth and metastasis in conjunction with
immunocompetent humanized mice with transplanted human immune system. Additionally, using organ-specific
and orthotopic spontaneous HCC metastasis models, we will study the role of NSD3 in HCC metastasis. In Aim
2, we will rigorously and comprehensively test the effectiveness of NSD3 inhibitors (BI-9321 and a NSD3-specific
Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTACs)) either alone or with other anti-cancer agents for HCC treatment in
vivo. These studies will utilize established HCC cell lines and HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDXs) and use
humanized mice transplanted with human immune system. Collectively, these studies will determine the role of
NSD3 as a driver of HCC and establish the efficacy of NSD3 inhibitors for treating advanced HCC."

10842465,"Project Summary/Abstract. With over 800 members, the largest family of human membrane proteins is the G-
protein coupled receptors (GPCRs, also called seven transmembrane receptors), which account for somewhere
between 30 and 40% of pharmaceutical targets. The significance of the family has fueled a flurry of structure
determination work with an explosion of new structures reported in just the last few years. Over the same period,
a lipidomic revolution has changed our view of the membrane environment of GPCRs — it is remarkably complex
and tightly regulated, with distinct lipid compositions in different tissues and in different cellular compartments.
 There is abundant evidence that lipids regulate GPCRs. But how does the membrane regulate GPCR
function? For example, the fully active state of a GPCR (the A2A adenosine receptor) is favored by negatively
charged lipids. But, how do we quantify “favors activation?” Answering this very basic question would advance
work that focuses on understanding mechanism in specific targets (like the A2A receptor), or other GPCRs, or
indeed any IMP for which conformational changes couple to the lipids. It would also allow surveying such
mechanisms across entire families (like the GPCRs), to understand lipid regulation across very different
membranes and physiological contexts. And, it would provide a path to quantitatively compare results from well-
controlled model systems and more physiological membrane environments — most GPCRs traffic to the plasma
membrane, which has a complex and asymmetric lipid composition. We propose to pursue this question through
a campaign of simulations and experimental measurements, tightly coordinated and organized by a
thermodynamic model for lipid regulation. By comparing across different GPCRs, membrane environments, and
between different receptor states, we will learn what aspects of functional lipid interactions are conserved, and
also how they vary."
10842510,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to contribute new engineering technologies that gain control over cell
collective phenomena responsible for driving epithelial organogenesis in vivo. Tightly packed epithelial
sheets and tubules are crucial to the function of a diverse group of organs including the lung, kidney, mammary
gland, and prostate. Congenital defects and adult diseases such as cancer that occur during the development
and maintenance of such organs are prevalent, creating a significant disease burden. This has driven
innovation in tissue engineering, which aims to create artificial tissues that serve as disease and therapy
screening models. However, modern tissue engineering approaches fail to harness several hallmarks of
epithelial organ formation, limiting the complexity of synthetic tissues and creating an urgent need for
innovation. Rather than being assembled from constituent cells all at once, processes like branching
morphogenesis progressively ramify, sculpt, and pack together functional tubule structures in vivo. The long-
term goal of the Hughes lab is to study and engineer missing tissue-building principles at play in organ
development to fill ongoing gaps in tissue engineering. This goal builds upon ongoing work in the Hughes lab
from the previous period of R35 funding beginning in 2019. This includes 1) precision ssDNA-based cell and
tissue interface micropatterning technologies to 2) control the size, cell composition, and differentiation
trajectory of epithelial organoids; 3) shape-changing ‘kinomorph’ tissue scaffolds for guiding tissue building
behaviors in cell collectives; and 4) mechanically manipulating epithelial progenitor niche regulation. Now our
overall objectives are to further advance three research visions across kidney and lung model systems. We
firstly seek to map the relationship between tissue mechanics and cell-cell signaling on epithelial
morphogenesis via orthogonal optogenetic ‘handles’. This will allow us to better control organoid cell
composition. We secondly seek to gain control over epithelial tubule shape and elongation by engineering
anisotropic collective cell forces through planar cell polarity pathways. We thirdly seek to combine tubule
construction and microfluidics approaches to engineer axial tubule polarity. Together these missing tissue-
building modules will contribute innovative enabling technologies for ‘higher-order’ tissue construction relevant
to the general medical sciences. The Hughes lab is uniquely suited to tackle our research vision due to our
expertise in stem cell engineering and optogenetics, live imaging, microfluidics, and advanced tissue assembly
strategies. We expect our proposed contributions to have significant positive impact in the areas of
fundamental biological discovery, tissue construction, and drug target screening."
10842567,"The majority of secreted and cell-surface proteins of all cell types studied so far are glycosylated, i.e.
decorated with sugar molecules. Protein glycosylation plays diverse structural and functional roles in
organisms, and is involved in animal development and physiology. Not surprisingly, over 160 human
diseases—collectively called Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation or CDGs—are caused by pathogenic
variants in the glycosylation machinery. Importantly, an approved therapy only exists for ~ 10% of CDGs,
highlighting the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the phenotypes caused by
glycosylation gene mutations. However, it is difficult to identify the biologically relevant targets and
molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypes observed upon mutating the genes involved in protein
glycosylation. This is in part due to the diversity of glycan structures attached to proteins and the large number
of proteins decorated by each form of glycosylation. The long-term goals of our research are to understand
how carbohydrate modifications regulate animal development and to use this knowledge to provide insight into
the pathophysiology of human glycosylation disorders, with the hope that these discoveries might help
establish frameworks for novel therapeutic approaches. Support from NIGMS in the last 15 years has allowed
us to provide major insights into the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway by O-glycosylation, identify
recessive POGLUT1 mutations in a novel form of muscular dystrophy (currently supported by NIAMS), and
establish POGLUT1 as a therapeutic target in preclinical models of Alagille syndrome (currently supported by
NIDDK). Moreover, using the Drosophila larval intestine as a model followed by cell culture and mouse
genetic experiments, we have reported evolutionarily conserved roles for a de-glycosylating enzyme called
N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) in BMP and AMPKα signaling, and have identified BMP4 as a direct target of NGLY1
in flies and mammals. We have also shown that this cytosolic enzyme, which removes N-glycans from
misfolded proteins, plays key roles in gut barrier function, innate immunity, and metabolism in Drosophila.
However, the N-glycoproteins that mediate most NGLY1 loss-of-function phenotypes remain to be identified.
Moreover, in an RNAi screen in Drosophila, we have found that multiple components of the N-glycosylation
machinery have overlapping phenotypes with NGLY1. Building on these recently published and preliminary
data, our focus in the next funding cycle will be on identification of biologically relevant targets of NGLY1
in the above-mentioned processes and elucidation of the developmental functions and critical targets of
glucosidase 1 (GCS1), an evolutionarily conserved enzyme involved in N-glycan trimming in the endoplasmic
reticulum. Successful accomplishment of our studies will establish the common and distinct biological
pathways and N-glycoprotein targets regulated by NGLY1 and other genes involved in N-glycosylation."
10842569,"Optimal cellular function requires balanced networks that maintain a proper flux of protein synthesis, folding,
trafficking, remodeling and degradation. There are many conserved and abundant multi-component enzyme
complexes that directly support this balance across eukaryotic life and are therefore critical control points for
maintaining proteostasis. During the project period, we propose to achieve three major goals, each of which
addresses an important, yet distinct, component of proteostasis: first, we will determine how the Cdc48 AAA+
ATPase resolves translational stress by working with the Ribosome Quality Control complex to remove stalled
products of translation; second, we aim to determine the mechanisms of how the CCT chaperone machine
facilitates the co-translational folding of native protein substrates; and third, we will determine how Cdc48
works with multiple adaptor proteins to facilitate protein unfolding prior to their targeted degradation. Each of
these complexes are critical to maintaining cellular health, and their misregulation directly causes a variety of
degenerative phenotypes. In order to meet our proposed goals, my lab will employ an integrative, “lysate-to-
grid” approach that combines endogenous purifications, proteomics, cryo-EM imaging, and computational
processing to visualize the mechanisms of protein quality control machinery in their functional states. This
approach will enable us to understand the atomic-scale details of the continuous motions that underlie the
fundamental cellular processes of protein synthesis, folding, and unfolding, including how incomplete products
of translation are extracted from stalled ribosomes, how chaperones fold proteins as they are translated, and
how folded proteins overcome their energetic barriers to become unfolded prior to their degradation. Overall,
the insights we uncover will deepen understanding of how cells maintain proteostasis and how disruptions in
protein quality control machinery contribute to cellular dysfunction."

A critical challenge in understanding the intricate programs underlying development, assembly,
function, and dysfunction of the human nervous system is the lack of direct access to intact,
functioning human brain tissue for detailed investigation by imaging, recording, and stimulation.
My laboratory has been developing methods for directed differentiation of region-specific brain
organoids and we have shown that these can combined two by two to study cell-cell interactions
and circuit formation in preparations called brain assembloids. However, current in vitro brain
models derived from stem cells do not capture neuromodulatory input, which restrict broader
applications in neuroscience and modeling of disease. Here, we propose to develop a human 3D
cellular platform that includes neuromodulatory projections. More specifically, we will derive
from pluripotent stem cells regionalized brain organoids resembling the nucleus raphe in the
brainstem and containing serotonergic neurons, and subsequently assemble them with cortical
organoids. Using state-of-the-art live imaging, transcriptomics, pharmacology, viral tracing and
electrophysiological methods, we plan to study serotonergic input into the cerebral cortex and use
this platform to investigate defects in neuronal cross-talk in a severe genetic form of
neurodevelopmental disease."

Fecal incontinence (FI) affects 1 in 7 Americans with a rising incidence that poses a major healthcare burden.
Its pathophysiology is poorly understood and consequently there is dearth of effective treatment(s). A critical
barrier to progress has been the lack of comprehensive, physiologically-relevant and practical diagnostic test
for identifying the underlying mechanism(s). Current tests provide either incomplete or conflicting information
that do not correlate with symptoms and treatment outcomes. Our goal is to determine the role of anorectal
muscles in maintaining continence and facilitating defecation, and how anorectal malfunctions can cause FI by
using a novel technology called Fecobionics (an electronic simulated stool) to evaluate its diagnostic and
therapeutic utility. Fecobionics has the consistency and shape of normal stool that can record pressures, cross-
sectional area, orientation, and viscoelastic properties of the anorectum. With heavily upgraded hardware,
software and graphical user interface, the new Fecobionics device map the geometric profiles during evacuation
and relate them to simultaneous changes in pressures (forces) and bending. Our central hypothesis is that the
movement of the Fecobionics device through the anorectum will provide unknown and new mechanistic insights
on anorectal physiology including intraluminal pressure changes, anal muscle length-tension relations,
resistance generated during movement of the surrogate stool and its deformability, as well as distensibility of the
anal sphincters in normal subjects and FI patients. This multidimensional data could facilitate new treatments for
FI. Accordingly, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the length-tension properties of the anal sphincters
using Fecobionics in normal subjects and FI patients during anal distension and during simulated evacuation. 2)
Elucidate the pathophysiological characteristics and biomechanical properties of individual muscle components,
external, internal anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle using the Fecobionics device and comparing FI patients
with normal subject controls; and 3) Evaluate the use of Fecobionics as a biofeedback treatment (BT) and
monitoring tool in FI patients to determine the predictors for treatment success, by performing a randomized
controlled trial of Fecobionics-assisted Biofeedback Therapy (FBT) versus conventional Office-based
Biofeedback Therapy (OBT). Our proposal seeks to shift current FI research by testing a stool surrogate for
performing BT as opposed to a thin manometry probe and examine the multi-dimensional physiologic changes
(i.e., pressure, deformability, biomechanics, vectoral and topographic changes) as well as clinical outcome
following BT. The unique aspect of our proposal is to simulate stooling with a wireless bionics device and
examine in detail the mechanistic underpinnings in health and in FI patients. The impact of our project is to
provide new mechanistic understanding of anorectal function and pathophysiology in FI and validate the clinical
utility of a novel, highly integrated device for diagnostics and facilitation of biofeedback therapy with an
unprecedented graphical feedback to the patient of mechanosensory actions."

Curation and Informatics Component
The Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) offers zebrafish, research materials, and diagnostic health
services to the biomedical research community. Currently, ZIRC houses and provides 12,823 genetic lines
(representing 46,127 distinct alleles) and receives hundreds of shipments of new lines each year. However,
ZIRC currently faces challenges in acquiring and managing line-specific metadata, resulting in incomplete or
incorrect data submission and delayed processes. Moreover, the captured data are currently not stored and
shared following FAIR data sharing guidelines. There is an urgent need to address this problem by making
new, line-specific information and metadata available to the public and avoid loss of effort when researchers
and ZIRC staff work with new zebrafish lines.
As a solution, ZIRC proposes to develop a web-based line-specific information platform that will help
standardize metadata submission and streamline data validation, troubleshooting, curation, and public sharing.
We propose to create a web-portal for the submission of fish lines and line-specific metadata by users. This will
create the front-end of the line-specific metadata platform that will facilitate, streamline, and standardize data
submission for submitters and curators. We will curate stocks using the newly developed portal and develop a
back-end database for the management of submitted line-specific metadata. This staging database, accessed
by ZIRC and ZFIN, will harmonize the databases by providing ZFIN identifiers and controlled vocabulary for
ZIRC metadata creation. It also streamlines the review and approval of data, storing information under review
before transferring it to permanent tables for public access. Line-specific data, with supporting metadata, will
be available to the research community via the ZIRC and ZFIN websites. The new database will also expand
our current reporting tools to include line acquisition data, enhancing RPPR/sRPPR reporting with known
identifiers and controlled vocabularies. We will support these aims by ensuring thorough training of ZIRC staff
in programming languages, database management and curation, zebrafish husbandry, lab procedures, and
professional development."
10860460,"1 Long-bone fractures such as those in the femur afflict more than 430,000 Americans per year and are
 2 rising due to the aging population. Such fractures are serious injuries that require surgery. Aligning the long bone
 3 fragments requires high precision in the presence of a huge traction force and is performed manually by
 4 orthopedic surgeons before fixation. Surgeons have limited visual feedback even with repeated X-ray images,
 5 and rotational malalignment of 10° or more after fracture fixation occurs in 28% of patients. Complications include
 6 malalignment or nonunion of bone fragments, leg shortening, soft tissue damage, and high exposure to X-ray
7 radiation.
 8 This work proposes a surgical robotic system that facilitates long-bone alignment currently performed
 9 manually. The long-term objectives are to build and demonstrate a surgical robot that provides a large workspace
10 for the surgeon, can provide traction forces sufficiently large to align the bone fragments without damaging the
11 bones, and provides sub-millimeter precision for alignment. Patient outcomes will be improved by decreasing
12 procedure times and eliminating complications that require repeated operations, such as leg length
13 discrepancies and abnormal gait. The first Specific Aim focus is to develop an image-guided navigation system
14 to automatically align based on surgeon selected positioning on 3D model of the bone fragments. The second
15 Specific Aim focus is to demonstrate use of a force-feedback (haptic) controller for the surgeon to sense the
16 magnitude and direction of the muscle forces and manipulate the robot to align the femur segments. The third
17 Specific Aim is (i) to develop a clinical-grade robotic system that align bone fragments, eliminate the need for
18 manually applied force during alignment, and provide an open surgical field for the surgeon, (ii) to integrate robot
19 with the navigation system and haptic controller, and (iii) evaluate its performance via cadaver testing and user
20 feedback.
21 This design-directed translational research will result in a robotic system that transforms surgical
22 practices for femur fractures and reduces complications. The use of the robot is anticipated to improve alignment
23 by 90% compared to unassisted surgery. The research lays the groundwork for future work to automate bone
24 segment alignment with a new innovative image-guided path-planning algorithm."
10860527,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Pain, often referred to as the “fifth vital sign,” is a universal experience and a major reason to seek medical
intervention. Growing evidence indicates a regulatory role of our biological timer, the circadian clock, in pain
timing and thresholds. Particularly, several headache disorders have been found to display distinct circadian
features, including cluster headache (CH) and migraine. CH is an extremely painful disorder (nicknamed “suicide
headache”), affecting 1 out of every 1,000 people, and is known to exhibit a precise daily rhythmicity of headache
attacks. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying rhythmic pain responses in headache disorders remain
poorly understood. This significant gap in knowledge hinders the development of novel chronotherapeutic
strategies to optimize pain management. To elucidate the circadian regulation of pain responses, we first
examined the trigeminal ganglion (TG), the primary somatosensory ganglion for the canonical headache
pathway, and discovered strong circadian rhythms in TG ex vivo cultures. Using a nitroglycerin (NTG) induced
mouse headache model, we demonstrated circadian rhythms of pain sensitivity which were abolished when the
core clock genes Per1/Per2 were disrupted. TG RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a robust circadian
transcriptome including core clock genes and clock-regulated pain neurotransmitters. Among the most
rhythmically expressed genes in the TG circadian transcriptome, Mertk (MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine receptor
kinase) was recently identified as a CH susceptibility gene in three independent large-scale GWAS studies;
however, its role in pain pathways is completely unknown. We found that NTG induced the phosphorylation of
MERTK (which is required for its tyrosine kinase activity), and importantly circadian pain sensitivity was abolished
in Mertk KO mice, suggesting a role for Mertk to confer circadian timing to pain pathways. Based on these
exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the TG circadian clock governs rhythmic headache responses
via regulation of pain genes including the novel regulator Mertk. Our two specific aims are as follows. In Aim 1,
combining genetic, environmental and pharmacological approaches, we will delineate the regulatory role of the
nociceptive neuron clock in headache pain rhythms and a potential chronotherapeutic application. In Aim 2, we
will investigate the role of MERTK in rhythmic headache responses and identify downstream mechanistic
pathways. This grant proposal embodies conceptual and experimental innovations including circadian regulation
of headache pain and a novel regulatory role of MERTK in the clock-headache crosstalk. With the unique
combination of complementary expertise in circadian biology and headache/CH, we are ideally suited to
interrogate key molecular mechanisms at the interface of circadian rhythms and headache pain. Given the
increasing appreciation of the fundamental function of the clock in pain pathophysiology, our study will have
strong basic and translational impact, and may ultimately lead to a new paradigm of manipulating the circadian
machinery to ameliorate headache pain."

Alphaviruses are mosquito-transmitted, positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that cause severe diseases in
humans, including lethal encephalitis. Despite their epidemic potential, there are no FDA-approved antivirals or
vaccines against any alphavirus infection. Infections by certain alphaviruses have increased in recent years,
likely secondary to climate change. Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and
Western equine encephalitis virus cause outbreaks in horses and humans in the Americas. While all three viruses
pose threats to public health, among them, eastern equine encephalitis virus carries the highest case fatality rate
(30-80%). Of those who survive eastern equine encephalitis virus infection, most are left with permanent
neurological damage. The cellular receptors that most alphaviruses bind to when infecting cells have remained
elusive, and this knowledge gap has limited our understanding of key determinants of alphavirus pathogenesis
and of pathways for potential therapeutic intervention through molecules that block virus receptor binding. Our
lab recently discovered that very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2, two
LDLR-related proteins that are also expressed in the brain, are cellular receptors for eastern equine encephalitis
virus. Western equine encephalitis virus had unknown receptors. We identified related and unrelated membrane
proteins that are highly enriched in the brain as receptors for western equine encephalitis virus. We hypothesize
that binding to VLDLR, ApoER2, or the newly identified receptors explains mechanisms for differential cellular
entry, tissue distribution, and viral pathogenesis of different encephalitic alphaviruses. In Aim 1, we will study
whether eastern equine encephalitis virus entry into physiologically relevant brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes,
and microglial cells) critically depends on VLDLR and ApoER2 and determine if blockade of these receptors can
protect mice from viral encephalitis. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether western equine encephalitis virus binding
to its receptors is also a critical determinant of infection of human brain cell types in vitro and of
neuropathogenesis in mice. In Aim 3, we will determine high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of
virus-like particles bound to different alphavirus receptors. Our studies may pave the way for the design of
inhibitors that help combat alphavirus encephalitis by preventing attachment to cellular receptors and help
address an urgent need for antivirals against these important human pathogens."

We propose the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative 2 (EDGI2), a new collaborative R01 in response to PAR-
23-050 Clinical Studies of Mental Illness. Its single-site predecessors, EDGI1 (R01 MH120170) and ARFID-GEN
(R56 MH129437) have been resoundingly successful. We now unite the four original EDGI1 sites with
exceptionally productive global new sites to advance genomic discovery across all major eating disorders (EDs)
to identify biologically, clinically, culturally, and therapeutically meaningful and actionable insights. Aim 1: EDGI2
extends our core business by increasing sample size, diversity, and ED phenotypes. Using our comprehensive
harmonized online assessment battery, we will phenotype and bio-sample 20,000 new participants with anorexia
nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
(ARFID), and controls. EDGI2 emphasizes co-production—with representatives from minoritized and
marginalized communities, we will ascertain 30% of samples from underrepresented groups. We will also over-
sample individuals with severe and enduring AN (SE-AN), whose DNA may be enriched for causative alleles.
Aim 2: We will apply statistical genetic analyses to explicate heterogeneity and biology of EDs by: conducting
standard GWAS analyses on diagnoses, trans-diagnostic behaviors, and continuous phenotypes including
polygenic risk score (PRS), and rare variant CNV analyses; identifying clinically meaningfully patient subsets;
and intensively evaluating our proposal that AN is a metabo-psychiatric disorders using LDSC, PRSet, pheWAS,
and Mendelian randomization to clarify direction of causation. Aim 3: We will evaluate the relative roles of genetic
and environmental risk and resilience factors to inform risk prediction by phenotypically characterizing cases and
controls with high and low PRS for EDs and then by genotypically characterizing those with severe ED
phenotypes. We will characterize distinct genetic or molecular groupings/patterns across cases and controls and
phenotypically characterize identified molecular subtypes. Aim 4: To determine where in the body EDs “live”, we
will identify brain cell types and anatomical regions implicated by genomic studies of EDs; predict genetically
regulated gene expression (GREx) in brain, gut, adipose, and other ED-relevant tissues; use snRNAseq atlases
to sharpen preliminary GTEx and TWAS analyses to identify brain cell types strongly implicated by the genomics
of each ED; expand to relevant non-brain cell types (e.g., adipose, muscle, liver, salivary); and use dynamic
GREx to model gene expression in ED-relevant contexts (e.g., sex, BMI, stress) enabling precise and
personalized modelling of gene expression. Aim 5: EDGI2 will culminate in a Translational Summit uniting
forward-thinking stakeholders from multiple sectors to develop a translational roadmap for evidence-based ED
prevention and treatment. EDGI2 will yield critical knowledge about genetic and environmental risk for EDs,
reveal mechanisms that potentiate or protect against genetic risk, and transition ED genetics from discovery to
clinical translation."

of -7/del(7q) remain undetermined.
 We hypothesize that the hemizygous deletion of one or more haploinsufficient essential genes on
chromosome 7q is responsible for ineffective hematopoiesis, akin to the partial loss of ribosomal proteins in 5q
deletion myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inherited BM failure syndromes. Such a hemizygous deletion
may create specific vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically targeted by further inhibiting the encoded protein,
a related protein, or an associated pathway.
 Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) play a crucial role in regulating several vital cellular processes by
controlling the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of RNA, ribosomes, transcription regulators, and drug targets. We
conducted comprehensive statistical analyses and individual CRISPR knockout experiments, which revealed
NUP205, an NPC member, to be a haploinsufficient essential gene on chromosome 7q. Knockout or knockdown
of NUP205 results in a growth disadvantage or cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. NUP205 hemizygous
deletion single-cell clones exhibit resistance to cytarabine and increased sensitivity to elesclomol, consistent with
the drug profile of -7/del(7q) primary leukemia samples in the Beat AML cohort. Therefore, we hypothesize that
the deletion of the haploinsufficient essential gene NUP205 contributes to the BM insufficiency phenotype
observed in -7/del(7q) patients and can be therapeutically targeted using elesclomol-based treatments to
specifically eliminate malignant cells harboring -7/del(7q).
 We propose here: (1) to investigate the functional impacts of NUP205 on hematopoiesis; (2) to elucidate
the mechanisms of NUP205 deletion-mediated impacts on cellular activity and chemosensitivity; (3) to
investigate elesclomol combination therapies targeting leukemia cells harboring -7/del(7q).
 Collectively, our studies will elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of NUP205 deletions in driving
the BM insufficiency phenotype, creating specific vulnerabilities, and shaping the drug responses for subsets of
myeloid malignancies. Ultimately, this effort will provide a basis for further translational work and the
development of promising inhibitors for clinical testing. Additionally, our study will serve as a prototype for
identifying novel therapeutic vulnerabilities for other chromosome deletions in hematological malignancies."
10862542,"Postpartum-related breast cancers (PRBCs), herein defined as breast cancers (BCs) diagnosed within five years
after a birth, augur a poor prognosis. Although early age at first birth and multiparity lower risk of late onset BCs,
childbirth transiently increases risks of both estrogen receptor (ER)+ and ER- BCs for over two decades,
with peak risks at 5 years postpartum (parous vs. nulliparous: HR=1.80, 95%CI=1.63-1.99). Peak risks are even
higher among women with a family history of BC (parous vs. nulliparous: HR=3.53, 95%CI=2.91-4.29), and for
women whose first birth is at later ages (pinteraction=0.03). In preclinical models, post-partum involution (PPI), a
pro-inflammatory process which restores the breast to a non-lactating state after weaning, is linked to activation
of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which increases production of prostaglandins and results in an immune
suppressed, pro-carcinogenic “wound healing” microenvironment that drives BC progression; in these models,
treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) inhibits PRBC development. Among women,
both postpartum normal breast tissues and BBD biopsies are characterized by significant inflammation. We and
others have reported significantly reduced risk of BC among NSAID users with benign breast disease (BBD),
suggesting a potential preventive benefit for women at risk of PRBC. We propose 3 aims to test the hypothesis
that dysregulated PPI increases risk of BBD and PRBC, and that inhibition of deleterious inflammation
following PPI can lower BC risk. In Aim 1, we will define and validate a PPI-specific immune signature
score to distinguish normal breast tissues of young nulliparous from parous women (obtained within 5 years of
a birth, matched by age) using 240 samples donated to the Komen Tissue Bank (KTB). We will also measure
eicosanoids, including prostaglandin E2, in frozen tissues from a subset (n=100) of these women. We will define
factors related to PPI immune signature score, hypothesizing that higher scores may indicate increased PRBC
risk. In Aim 2, we will refine and independently test whether a PRBC immune signature score based on 8
previously defined markers with a combined AUC=0.76 predicts risk in previously untested BBD biopsies (75
cases and 75 matched controls). We will compare PRBC immune signature scores in 707 BCs from women
aged 40 years or less by parity status, molecular subtype, and adjusted for potential confounders. In Aim 3, we
will conduct a window of opportunity clinical trial to test if a 6-week course of aspirin 81 mg per day can
reduce the deleterious inflammation associated with PRBC risk (i.e., PRBC immune score) and favorably alter
other BC risk markers in breast tissues, blood and urine. This significant and innovative proposal seeks to
define a unifying mechanism of pathogenesis for PRBC, which will provide the basis for developing a
short-term, well-tolerated prevention strategy using immune-targeting and/or anti-inflammatory agents
to prevent BC."

Obesity is a significant public health concern and a well-known risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC).
Western diet, high in calories and fat and deficient in fiber-rich foods, is a key driver of metabolic diseases like
obesity and CRC. High-fiber diets including foods like legumes, such as dry beans and lentils, could have
favorable effects on underlying biological responses that mediate the obesity-cancer relationship including
insulin signaling, chronic inflammation, gastrointestinal motility, gut microbiota changes and the balance
between cell proliferation and apoptosis. We propose to build upon our previous research demonstrating that
short-term strictly monitored increases in fiber-rich food consumption facilitates weight loss and suppresses
biomarkers of cancer risk. The goal of the current research is to conduct a 12-month parallel arm randomized
clinical trial featuring pre-portioned entrées and strategic nutritional instruction to integrate legumes into a
healthy high-fiber diet pattern. Over the course of the intervention participants will receive intense education
combined with behavior modification, transitioning to self-directed and finally sustainable maintenance phases.
The research will target a diverse population at highest risk for CRC (recruit n=70; 50% males / 50% females),
overweight and obese participants with a history of polypectomy, to test whether a high-legume, high-fiber diet
will increase weight loss and suppress colonic mucosal biomarkers of cancer risk compared to a control diet. In
addition, we will explore potential beneficial effects of the high-legume intervention diet on the microbiome and
metabolome, gastrointestinal transit time and on systemic biomarkers of inflammation and insulin resistance.
Given the 20-fold differences in CRC between populations consuming high-fiber diets and low-fiber Western
diets, the results of this study may demonstrate substantial potential for dietary change to reduce mortality from
CRC and other westernized diseases."

Among young adults (18-24 years), a concerning 10-20% develop advanced but asymptomatic atherosclerotic
lesions, yet cardiometabolic disease (CMD) prevention is understudied. In the U.S. two-thirds of young adults
attend college, during which they adopt poor lifestyle behaviors that contribute to CMD risk. For example,
college-based young adults (CBYA) engage in sedentary behavior (SB), defined as very low intensity
behaviors in a seated, reclined, or supine postures, for ~7 hr/day. National and international public health
agencies have recently called on the research community to better understand how to implement SB-reduction
strategies. However, while CBYA present a captive but understudied population, we have scant understanding
as to how to target this multi-dimensional behavior. Our long-term goal is the primary prevention of CMD in
CBYA. To support this goal, the overarching aim of this proposal is to develop an evidence-based,
multi-level intervention to target SB reduction. This longitudinal observational study will recruit a cohort of
500 CBYA (18-24 years) from a representative state college population. On each of the two visits (12 months
apart) we will measure traditional and novel CMD risk biomarkers and administer participant questionnaires to
collect information on lifestyle behaviors (diet, chronotype, substance use) and socio-ecological (individual,
intra-individual, inter-individual) predictors of SB. Over the next 7 days, SB quantity will be captured using a
thigh-worn inclinometer, and physical activity and sleep behaviors using accelerometry. SB context (television,
transportation, academic/occupational, leisure computer, other) will be measured using ecological momentary
analysis. Aim 1 will identify whether total SB (T-SB) or context-specific SB (CS-SB) is more strongly
associated with CMD risk. The degree to which SB confers CMD risk likely depends on the context in which it
occurs. For example, in the general adult population, television viewing is more strongly associated with CMD
than other CS-SB. The reasons are unknown but may include the greater likelihood of co-occurring unhealthy
behaviors (e.g., processed foods) while watching television. Therefore, Aim 2 will identify how much CMD risk
is explained directly by SB, versus indirectly mediated by co-occurring lifestyle behaviors. Aim 3 will then
identify multi-level intervention targets. To date, the existing longitudinal research has predominantly focused
on non-modifiable socio-demographic variables. We will use a socioecological model to identify modifiable
predictors. Last, will use the Intervention Mapping protocol to design an intervention implementation and
evaluation plan. This innovative proposal will enhance our understanding of the importance of CS-SB and co-
occurring behaviors to CMD risk. The final product will be an evidence-based CS-SB reduction intervention to
target primary CMD prevention in CBYA. The likelihood of future high impact is enhanced by: college
campuses are relatively contained are well-suited to multi-level interventions; behaviors adopted during college
track into older adulthood; and our experienced multi-disciplinary team."

Decision-making is an essential component of spatial navigation as animals convert environmental cues and
internal signals into locomotor actions to reach goal locations. In many experimental paradigms, the neural
mechanisms for navigation and decision-making have been studied separately, leaving open important questions
about how these processes are linked. Findings from our previous grant period, along with recent work in the
field, indicate that the dorsal, posterior cortex – visual, parietal, and retrosplenial cortices – participate in key
computations for navigation-based decision-making. Here we propose to test working models of how these areas
and their interactions contribute during navigation-based decision tasks. We will develop a range of new tools
including: behavioral tasks and analyses for navigation-based decision-making in virtual reality environments,
calcium imaging approaches to record activity in neuronal populations in multiple areas at cellular resolution over
weeks, and computational approaches to understand the encoding of behavioral and task features in single
neurons and large populations. In a first aim, we will test hypotheses about how visual, parietal, and retrosplenial
cortices make distinct contributions to navigation-based decision tasks. We will use a combination of behavioral
modeling, optogenetic perturbations, and calcium imaging. In a second aim, we will analyze the information
transmitted between visual, parietal, and retrosplenial cortices on a moment-by-moment basis during navigation
decisions. We will image activity in multiple cortical regions simultaneously and analyze information flow in
conjunction with retrograde labeling approaches. In a third aim, we will address how these representations and
inter-area interactions develop during learning of navigation- and decision-related associations. We will use
methods to track the activity of the same neurons, in multiple cortical regions, daily over weeks as mice learn
phases of navigation-based decision tasks. Together, this work will advance our understanding of how cortical
regions and their interactions mediate the planning and choice computations essential for effective decision-
making during spatial navigation."
10860038,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:
Cellular innate immune receptors play a vital role in recognizing pathogenic molecules and initiating an innate
immune response to combat infections. However, when these receptors mistakenly sense ""self"" molecules, it
can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases. One such cytosolic receptor, MDA5, forms filaments on
viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to activate the antiviral interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. The question
arises: how does MDA5 differentiate between ""self"" cellular dsRNAs and ""non-self"" viral RNAs? Research con-
ducted by our team and others suggests that the ADAR1 protein catalyzes Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA
editing on cellular dsRNAs, marking them as ""self"" RNAs and preventing erroneous MDA5 sensing. Mouse mod-
els deficient in ADAR1 RNA editing are not viable, but their survival to the full lifespan can be rescued by remov-
ing MDA5. In humans, rare autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome exhibit loss-of-function
mutations in ADAR1 and gain-of-function mutations in MDA5. Our recent work has shown that insufficient editing
of dsRNAs is associated with presumed dsRNA-mediated inflammation in various autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases, including Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, and Coronary Artery
Disease. In the well-established ADAR1-dsRNA-MDA5 axis, there is an urgent need to identify the specific cel-
lular dsRNAs that require ADAR1 editing to evade MDA5 sensing. We define these dsRNAs as immunogenic
dsRNAs, as their lack of editing leads to increased immunogenicity.
The primary objective of this research is to develop effective approaches to systematically identify and charac-
terize immunogenic dsRNAs involved in inflammatory diseases and to investigate how the editing status and
expression level of dsRNAs influence their immunogenicity. Firstly, we will utilize a recently developed genetic
approach to identify immunogenic dsRNAs in various human cell types that we determine to be most relevant in
inflammatory diseases. Subsequently, we will employ genetic, biochemical, and computational methods to thor-
oughly characterize and validate these immunogenic dsRNAs. Secondly, we will expand our work on systemat-
ically identifying genetic variants associated with editing levels. This expansion will enable us to pinpoint immu-
nogenic dsRNAs that colocalize with GWAS loci associated with common autoimmune and inflammatory dis-
eases. Additionally, we will develop a predictive model to assess an individual's burden of immunogenic dsRNAs
as a cumulative measure. This model will aid in stratifying patients with inflammatory diseases, where impaired
dsRNA editing and heightened dsRNA sensing likely contribute to chronic inflammation. In summary, by identi-
fying the most crucial dsRNA substrates of ADAR1 and ligands of MDA5, this work will bridge a significant
knowledge gap in the field. Furthermore, it will provide important mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential
regarding how ADAR1 RNA editing prevents MDA5-mediated dsRNA sensing and innate immunity in both
healthy and inflammatory disease contexts."

A sea-change in attitudes towards reproducible research in social science and epidemiology has occurred over
the past 30 years. Reproducibility has moved from a footnote to center-stage and is now recognized as an
essential component of scientific rigor. The concepts of reproducible science relate not only to the capacity to
reproduce the work of a specific study when using the same data, but to the larger ecosystem in which
research is planned, fielded, critiqued, and interpreted. Systemic biases and error-prone research pipelines
both compromise reproducibility and are now recognized to hinder scientific progress. The nature of research
has also evolved, with increasing emphasis on data analysis, growing access to extensive computational
power, and large, complex data sets. Behavioral and social science research on healthy aging faces special
concerns for reproducibility and these concepts should be integral to training on aging research.
The University of California, San Francisco Training in Reproducible Research on Aging for Social
Science and Epidemiology (UCSF-TRASE) program will develop (AIM 1) intensive short courses on
reproducible research perspectives and skills. We propose four brief (3-day), intensive training modules. Each
module combines didactics and experiential learning, with a substantive focus on health disparities and aging,
and methodologic focus on causal inference. Module 1 introduces concepts of reproducibility for research on
population health and aging. This module is appropriate for researchers and consumers of scientific research
and will provide critical evaluation skills relevant for reviewing journal articles and grant applications,
interpreting published findings, and leading research Module 1 assumes a basic scientific research background
but will be accessible to, for example, practicing physicians, science journalists, administrators, as well as
graduate and post-doctoral trainees. Module 2 provides skills for implementing reproducible analyses, such as
pre-registration; statistical coding hygiene and evaluation; transparent reporting; and documentation, including
for collaborative projects. Module 3 addresses fielding primary data collection to foster reproducibility,
considering study design, statistical power, protocol documentation, data quality control. Module 4 provides
training on integrating evidence to enhance reproducibility of scientific advances, e.g., meta-research,
evidence triangulation approaches. Each training module can stand alone or be combined for a more
comprehensive skill set. We emphasize hands-on skills building to learn best practices in the context of
contemporary problems. The modules build on the outstanding foundation in the existing UCSF training
programs, using many activities already demonstrated to succeed in our other training programs, and curating
for the intensive short-course format to provide participants, across career stages, with both conceptual and
technical skills to enhance reproducibility. We propose (AIM 2) to roll out the modules with ongoing evaluation
and refinement and (AIM 3) use multiple dissemination strategies to maximize the impact of the curriculum."
10837691,"Astrocytes are known to provide support to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that control
the reproductive axis, for example by releasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) required for fertility. Astrocytes may
also play a critical role in the brain as metabolic sensors. In response to insulin, astrocytes increase glucose
uptake across the blood brain barrier and release metabolites and gliotransmitters to support neuronal
function. We have recently demonstrated a unique biological role for astrocytes in coupling fertility to energy
availability. We found that the absence of insulin signaling in astrocytes delays puberty, causes
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and dramatically reduces fertility. This finding is particularly exciting since
numerous studies have shown neuronal insulin sensing is unnecessary for reproduction. We have also found
that loss of astrocyte insulin sensing reduces PGE2 synthase levels, leading us to hypothesize that astrocyte
insulin sensing facilitates GnRH release by promoting astrocyte PGE2 release. New preliminary data suggest
that insulin signaling via FOXO pathways alter the transcription of enzymes in the PGE2 biosynthesis pathway,
such as COX-2. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims. Aim 1) Define the relevant
temporal & spatial parameters of astrocyte insulin signaling. Using the tet-on genetic targeting system, we will
test whether astrocytes must sense insulin during adulthood or prior to puberty in order to permit normal
reproductive function. Astrocyte-specific viral cre administration will also determine the importance of
astrocyte insulin sensing in the arcuate nucleus and the rostral preoptic area. Aim 2) Determine the impact of
insulin signaling on astrocyte PGE2 gliotransmitter production proximal to reproductive circuits.
Measurement of regional PGE2 production will be complemented by AAV targeted disruption of Cox-2
production by astrocytes to determine its importance for fertility. Finally, we will determine whether Kiss1
neurons sense PGE2, leading to altered GnRH release. Aim 3) Determine the molecular role of the insulin/
FOXO pathway in astrocyte PGE2 synthesis. An astrocyte cell line will be used to systematically investigate the
major aspects of insulin/FOXO/COX signaling, including phosphorylation, localization, promoter occupancy,
and quantitative transcriptional activity measurements. Finally, we will ablate insulin signaling pathways in
astrocytes to determine their effect on fertility and PGE2 production. Collectively, these studies will identify
how insulin signaling in astrocytes sustains reproductive circuit function. This work will elucidate what may be
the dominant mechanism in the mammalian brain whereby insulin permits normal fertility and pubertal
maturation. Our results will advance our long-term goal of finding treatment targets for impaired fertility in
patients recovering from energy deficits, obese and diabetic populations, and others with idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."
10837694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this project is to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of the effects of ultrasound
(US) on neural activity. US can modify action potential activity in neurons in vitro and in vivo without damaging
neural tissue. This phenomenon can be applied in powerful new tools for basic and clinical neuroscience, with
broad impact on public health issues related to mental and neurological disorders. To guide use of this new
tool, our research will provide insight into the physical, biophysical and neural mechanisms underlying US
neuromodulation.
 Our approach is unique in applying and integrating mechanistic studies of US neuromodulation at levels
of complexity ranging from the single cell to the whole animal. We aim to understand the relationship between
US 1) the physical processes that transform acoustic energy to effects on biological systems and the resulting
measurable physical variables (Aim 1), 2) the biophysical transduction processes together with the resulting
measurable biophysical effects (Aim 2) 3) the subsequent neural integration processes that lead to the final
output of the neural system or behavior (Aim 3). We will address these questions in experiments across three
model systems (the in vivo mouse model, in vitro salamander and mouse retina, and single hippocampal
pyramidal cells in acute and cultured brain slices), focusing on hypotheses guided by our results thus far.
 US neuromodulation is likely to have significant impact on public health. Brain stimulation therapies are
used to treat Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and epilepsy and hold promise for many others. Compared to
current brain stimulation techniques that rely on invasive implanted electrodes or have limited spatial resolution
and depth penetration (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation), US offers an ideal combination of spatial
resolution, depth penetration, and non-invasiveness. US neuromodulation can also be implemented in
prosthetic devices; for example, to stimulate retinal circuitry to restore vision. In addition, US neuromodulation
promises to become an enormously useful research tool in basic neuroscience, and it is therefore relevant to
all mental and neurological disorders of public health concern. However, all these outcomes depend on the
ability to apply US neuromodulation with well-controlled, predictable results. Achieving this goal requires a
detailed mechanistic understanding of US neuromodulation that our multidisciplinary research project will
provide."
10850814,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of our project is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of induction and
decline of meibogenesis in Meibomian glands (MG) embedded in tarsal plates of humans and mice.
Meibogenesis is defined as an intricate array of catabolic and anabolic reactions, and corresponding regulatory
and signaling mechanisms, that lead to formation of a holocrine secretion called meibum. Meibum is a unique
lipid secretion that is comprised primarily of extremely long chain and branched wax esters, cholesteryl esters,
and a range of other, more complex, compounds. Meibum is vital to the ocular health as it forms a protective
layer that isolates the surface of the eye from the environment, and improves vision by changing the refractive
properties of the cornea. Lipid composition of meibum is very conservative in normal conditions, implying that
lipid homeostasis of MG is typically under tight control of yet to be identified regulatory mechanisms. However,
a MG pathology called MG dysfunction (MGD) results in a decline in meibum production, or adverse changes
in its composition, or both, negatively affecting the ocular surface physiology, vision, and quality of life in
general. MGD is a major contributing factor to a widespread condition called Dry Eye syndrome (DES). MGD
and DES affect up to 40% of the general population worldwide, disproportionately affecting elderly. Earlier, we
demonstrated that mice are credible models of human MG for studying meibogenesis. Using various lines of
mutant mice, we have established major genes and enzymes that are involved in meibogenesis. However, the
mechanisms of its initiation and regulation remain unknown. Previous attempts to induce meibogenesis in cell
cultures (such as immortalized human MG epithelial cells) failed, as no meibomian lipids have been produced
in any tested conditions. Thus, our aim is to elucidate the mechanism of meibogenesis induction and decline in
vivo by conducting transcriptomic, lipidomic, immunohistochemical, and physiological characterization of
developing and aging MG, using mice that undergo prenatal and postnatal development and aging as primary
animal model, and human subjects of different ages. These experiments should allow us to determine a
timeline of changes in developing, maturing, and aging MG, and correlate MG transcriptome in general, and
key genes of meibogenesis specifically, with the expression levels of specific enzymes and their corresponding
lipid products. Special consideration will be given to genes that simultaneously: 1) are highly expressed in MG,
2) encode signaling factors that are already known to control tissue growth, cell differentiation and lipid
homeostasis in MG and/or other tissues, and 3) whose expression levels undergo significant changes in
developing and aging MG. These results will provide critically important information for future in-depth studies
of MG physiology in the norm and pathology."
10850816,"Rod/cone coupling is the entry point to the secondary rod pathway. Our overall hypothesis is that the circadian
and light-induced modulation of rod/cone coupling changes retinal function and has profound effects throughout
the visual system according to the time of day. Electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions, are common
building blocks that connect neurons into coupled networks. Although electrical synapses display a high degree
of plasticity, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how this plasticity modifies circuit activity and output.
We anticipate that learning how to control electrical coupling may have useful clinical potential. We have
developed (1) the capability to record from pairs of adjacent mouse photoreceptors to directly measure the trans-junctional conductance; (2) rod-specific and cone-specific connexin36 (Cx36) knockout (XO) mouse lines. In
these mice, there is no rod/cone coupling, mimicking daytime or bright light. (3) a phospho-mimetic mutant Cx36
conditional knock-in (Cx36-DEDD) line, which displays saturated rod/cone coupling, equivalent to night time; and
(4) a congenic B6 mouse line in which we rescued melatonin synthesis—an important circadian clock signal that
is missing in most mouse strains. Retinas from the congenic line show robust circadian variations in dopamine
release.
In aim 1, by recording from rod/cone pairs, we will measure the gap junction conductance between rods
and cones to test the hypothesis that rod/cone coupling spans from ~ 0 to 1,000+ pS, reflecting the collective
action of melatonin, dopamine, and ambient light. We have shown there is no rod/cone coupling in the Cx36
XOs (mimics daytime) and we expect maximal coupling in the Cx36-DEDD (mimics nighttime). We will determine
how the rod/cone gap junction conductance changes by time of day (congenic B6 line).
In aim 2, we will record from cones and from ganglion cells to test the hypothesis that rod signals in the
secondary rod pathway change by time of day. We expect our mutant lines to set the limits, with minimal input
in the Cx36 XOs (mimics daytime) and maximal input in the Cx36-DEDD line (mimics nighttime).
 In aim 3, we will examine visual behavior in the intact mouse to measure the effect of an inactive (Cx36
XO, mimics daytime) and of a saturated rod/cone pathway (Cx36-DEDD, mimics nighttime). We will test the
hypothesis that rod/cone coupling plasticity contributes to the daily modulation of contrast sensitivity and visually-
guided behavior.
Our work will offer a prime example of how a single electrical synapse can change retinal function to influence
visual perception. This research will help define general principles underlying the role of circadian clocks and
electrical synaptic plasticity in the daily changes in neural circuits relevant to brain function and behavior."

 The neural crest (NC) is a stem cell population that originates within the forming central nervous
system. NC cells delaminate from the neuroepithelium by undergoing a spatiotemporally regulated epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) that proceeds in a coordinated wave head-to-tail to exit from the neural tube.
Cranial NC cells, which arise in the head region of the embryo and are the only NC population in vivo with the
ability to differentiate into craniofacial skeleton and cartilage, are indispensable for the development of the face;
mutations affecting NC development result in numerous diseases and malformations affecting the craniofacial
structures (e.g. Treacher Collins syndrome, cleft palate, etc.). Thus, a thorough understanding of the regulation
of cranial NC EMT is essential to identify the etiology of craniofacial abnormalities.
 To date, research has focused on unraveling early events governing cranial NC induction at the neural
plate border and the mechanism of delamination from the neural tube. However, little is known about the
regulatory changes governing the timing of NC EMT and exit from the neural tube. My preliminary studies
demonstrate that a Wnt pathway antagonist, Draxin, plays an important role in controlling the timing of NC
EMT, perturbations of which have negative consequences for cranial NC migration. This role for Draxin is
particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to be a major driver of
NC development. The goal of this Proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which Draxin affects
cranial NC EMT, with focus on its role in Wnt signaling. To this end, the Specific Aims of this Proposal seek to
combine chick embryology with state-of-the-art imaging and biochemistry to:
 1) Characterize the interaction of Draxin and Wnt signaling in cranial NC EMT;
 2) Identify the role of Draxin in the regulation of cell adhesion proteins;
 3) Characterize the post-transcriptional regulation of Draxin; and
 4) Identify the role of Draxin in the regulation of extracellular matrix proteins.
 The results of this Proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of the regulation of cranial NC
EMT and migration, providing new scientific avenues for translational research applications in the treatment of
craniofacial defects."

Reproduction and metabolism are closely regulated to ensure the survival of the organism and the species. The
central control of energy balance depends on the intricate interaction of central and peripheral signals that
ultimately regulate food intake and energy expenditure (EE). Among the central signals involved in the control of
energy balance, melanocortins (a-MSH) produced by proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons play a critical role
inducing satiety and increasing EE. a-MSH binds the melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) at the level of the
paraventricular nucleus to induce satiety, however, the site of action of melanocortins to regulate EE remains
under-characterized. Recently, the reproductive neuropeptide kisspeptin, encoded by Kiss1, has been identified
as a metabolic factor in several animal models, for example, kisspeptin signaling deficient mice develop obesity.
Kisspeptin has been demonstrated to be essential for the activation of the reproductive axis, however, its role in
metabolism requires further investigation. Our preliminary data expands on these findings and suggest that
melanocortin signaling to Kiss1 neurons is involved in the control of EE. We have showed that Kiss1
neurons a) express MC4R, b) respond directly to the stimulation by a-MSH, c) are direct targets of POMC
neurons, which post-synaptically regulate Kiss1 neurons, and d) innervate and activate Lepr neurons in the
dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) through glutamate release. In addition, we have demonstrated that the
specific removal of MC4R from Kiss1 neurons induces an increase in body weight (BW) due to a decrease in EE
without changes in overall food intake or activity and without causing hypogonadism. Therefore, we hypothesize
that Kiss1 neurons serve as mediators of the melanocortin action to regulate EE through the control of LeprDMH
neurons, thus uncovering a novel pathway of action for melanocortins in the control of energy balance that links
reproduction and metabolism. We propose to 1) evaluate the changes in EE after ablation or chronic activation
of Kiss1 neurons; 2) assess the overall contribution of Kiss1 neurons to the melanocortin regulation of EE
through the re-insertion of MC4R in Kiss1 neurons of MC4RKO mice; 3) map the neurocircuitry underlying this
role through the identification of neuronal projections and optogenetic activation of Kiss1 neuron terminals; 3)
assess the contribution of kisspeptin co-transmitters in the control of EE. Kiss1 neurons are the nodal
regulatory center of reproductive function and are, therefore, sensitive to changes in the circulating levels of sex
steroids. Thus, the successful completion of this proposal may offer the first approach to a comprehensive
pathway linking reproductive status and the regulation of energy expenditure that could explain the frequently
observed increase in BW after menopause in women or men with low testosterone. Moreover, the
characterization of Kiss1 neurons as an active player in the control of energy balance will inform the development
of new strategies to improve the treatment of metabolic disorders."

Proprioception, the sense of self-movement and body position, is critical for the effective control
of motor behavior. Humans lacking proprioceptive feedback, such as patients with peripheral
nerve damage, are unable to maintain limb posture or coordinate fine-scale movements of the
arms and legs. But despite the importance of proprioception to the control of movement in all
animals, little is known about the neural computations that underlie limb proprioception in any
animal. This gap is due to two basic challenges: (1) identifying specific neuronal-cell types that
detect and process proprioceptive signals, and (2) recording neural activity from proprioceptive
circuits during natural limb movements. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by
investigating the neural coding of leg proprioception in a genetic model organism: the fruit fly,
Drosophila. We have developed new methods to record and manipulate the activity of genetically-
identified neurons in proprioceptive circuits of behaving flies. We will first determine the
functional role of distinct proprioceptor subtypes in controlling limb posture and movement
during walking (Aim 1). We will then compare how proprioceptive signals are encoded during
passive and active limb movements (Aim 2), and trace down the circuit mechanisms that underlie
state-dependent proprioceptive coding (Aim 3). Altogether, these studies will elucidate basic
mechanisms of proprioceptive neural processing that have not possible to investigate in other
systems. Although there are morphological differences between flies and humans, the basic
building blocks of invertebrate and vertebrate somatosensory systems share a striking
evolutionary conservation. These similarities suggest that the general principles discovered in
circuits of the fruit fly will be highly relevant to somatosensory processing in other animals. A
deeper understanding of proprioception has the potential to transform the way in which we treat
somatosensory disorders."
10851711,"Eukaryotic cells have highly conserved enzymatic systems for ligating ubiquitin (Ub) and related
proteins such as SUMO to proteins. The modifications may lead to degradation of the targeted
protein, usually by the proteasome but sometimes also by the lysosome. Ub and SUMO
modifications are highly dynamic due to specialized proteases that remove them. Both modifiers
have many crucial roles, including important contributions to human biology. Substrates include
naturally short-lived regulators and aberrant “protein quality control” (PQC) substrates. Many
human disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and different cancers, are
associated with abnormalities in the Ub system. The system presents many potential targets for
drug development against a range of diseases.
In this application, the PI proposes to undertake studies on several newly discovered regulatory
mechanisms, which either alter protein modification by Ub or react to changes in the dynamics of
SUMO modification in striking ways. One focus is on the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
cells to loss of a key SUMO protease called Ulp2. The cells very quickly generate a specific two-
chromosome aneuploidy, but this is eventually resolved through in vitro evolution over hundreds
of generations. The evolutionary trajectories are related but distinct, and deep sequencing
technologies turn this into a powerful way to study the physiological mechanisms that allow cells
to adapt and flourish even without a seemingly crucial enzyme.
Another new research direction addresses the regulated proteolysis of an essential yeast protein
that controls both proteasome translocation into the nucleus and PQC at the ribosome. Its
degradation is tightly linked to its functional state. Subcellular movements of proteasomes and
their degradation under starvation conditions will also be examined. A final, also new area
addresses Ub system enzymes from endosymbiotic bacteria that infect humans and other
species. One focus is on a deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) from Orientia, the causative agent of
scrub typhus, a highly lethal disease. Surprisingly, the DUB protein not only cleaves Ub but also
binds tightly to it as well as to clathrin adaptor proteins, small GTPases, and a specific
phospholipid. The many activities in this single polypeptide are proposed to be coordinated in a
way that favors pathogen infection and propagation. Another DUB of great interest is from
Wolbachia, bacteria that infect millions of arthropod species and exploit this unusual DUB to alter
host reproduction and promote their own inheritance. Wolbachia are being deployed as agents
for fighting disease vectors such as the mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever or malaria."
10851713,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is a K23 proposal for Dr. Lauren Theilen, a Maternal-Fetal Medicine physician with expertise in long-term
maternal health following hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In order to investigate strategies for improved
cardiovascular (CV) health among women following complicated pregnancy, this K23 will allow Dr. Theilen to
acquire critical skills in four career development areas: 1) qualitative and mixed methods research approaches;
2) development and refinement of a patient decision aid; 3) design and conduct of clinical trials; and 4)
research leadership and management skills. To achieve her goals, Dr. Theilen has assembled an
interdisciplinary mentoring team comprised of Dr. Michael Varner (Primary Mentor), a senior investigator and
recognized leader in perinatal clinical trials, and three Co-Mentors: Dr. Bob Silver, an accomplished researcher
in the field of pregnancy as a window to future health, Dr. Susan Zickmund, an expert in qualitative and mixed
methods research, and Dr. Elissa Ozanne, a leading investigator in patient risk communication and decision
aid development. Complementing this mentoring team, Dr. Theilen also has a 3-member advisory committee to
support her proposed decision aid development and pilot trial. Current evidence demonstrates that women with
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have 2-fold higher risk for the later development of CV disease (CVD)
compared to women with healthy pregnancies. CVD prevention is a high priority for women’s health, as it is the
leading cause of death among women in the United States. In order to improve women’s CV health,
interventions for CV prevention could be initiated shortly after a pregnancy complicated by a hypertensive
disorder. However, few researchers are trained in developing patient-centered interventions to promote
preventive care engagement among postpartum women. Dr. Theilen’s objective is to address current gaps in
knowledge regarding needs, values, and barriers regarding CVD prevention among postpartum women with
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and to remedy the lack of available evidence-based interventions for this
at-risk population. She proposes the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Determine information needs, values,
and barriers influencing CV risk communication and engagement among postpartum women and their obstetric
and primary care providers; Aim 2) Develop a decision aid to improve patient CV risk knowledge and
preventive health engagement for postpartum women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and Aim 3)
Conduct a pilot study to demonstrate feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a patient decision aid to improve
patient knowledge and self-efficacy regarding CVD prevention during the postpartum period. The proposed
research is significant because it investigates a strategy to reduce the CVD burden among women with
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This proposal is innovative because it comprises a substantial departure
from the existing postpartum clinical care paradigm in the United States."

Disorders that affect communication have an enormous personal, societal, and economic impact. These
conditions (e.g. aphasia, developmental language disorder, dyslexia, deafness and hearing impairment, autism)
can be better addressed through a more complete understanding of the neural systems that support typical
communication. To make progress in assessment and treatment of these conditions, the next generation of
scientists needs to not only understand the underlying neural bases of disordered communication, but also how
to translate research from the laboratory to the clinic. Additionally, research on communication disorders must
incorporate not just historical knowledge but also the perspectives of the communities affected by these
conditions. Hard-won lessons teach us that meaningful change relies on community-engaged research, where
researchers and stakeholders collaborate to identify questions and build mutual trust. The current proposal, a
renewal of Cognitive Neuroscience of Communication training program, will recruit a total of thirteen predoctoral
trainees and five postdoctoral trainees, each serving a two-year traineeship, and equip them with specific skills
and competencies crucial for research careers. Trainees from Psychology and Speech, Language, and Hearing
Sciences will receive targeted instruction in cognitive neuroscience, with an emphasis on neuroimaging methods,
and will learn to apply those skills in trainee-led, mentored research projects. Further, training will emphasize the
application of basic research, and trainees will interact not only with scientists who are experts in communication
disorders, but also clinicians and community stakeholders, including those that are affected by aphasia, dyslexia,
and autism, among other conditions. Individualized development plans support these training themes, reinforcing
skills in community-engaged research, individual differences methods, and computational skills. Our mentor
team, drawn from faculty in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences and three different degree programs in
Psychology, has substantial expertise in a variety of neuroimaging and neuromodulation methods (e.g. fMRI,
fNIRS, TMS/tDCS, EEG/ERP) and has conducted impactful research on a range of communication disorders
(e.g. aphasia, hearing loss, dyslexia, developmental language disorder, autism). This training program will
produce a cohort of scholars who are poised to make significant progress in the study of communication."

This application from Columbia University requests a third competitive renewal of a postdoctoral training program
in digestive and liver diseases. The program, last reviewed in October 2018, is designed to provide research
training opportunities for physician-scientist trainees in Gastroenterology-based fellowship programs, to prepare
them into becoming independent basic, clinical and translational investigators. The T32 program, which has
been in existence for fourteen years, takes advantage of many of the existing strengths of Columbia University,
including a number of Centers and Departments and the broad framework of research at the university. The
program has a long record of success, with >80% of the trainees that completed the program currently in
academic positions at top universities and medical centers in the U.S., most with external funding. A major
strength of the program is the highly collaborative and well-funded faculty as well as the many recent faculty
recruits and the new, NIH-funded Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center at Columbia. In addition, the
training program builds on the highly academically oriented residency and fellowship programs in both adult and
pediatric gastroenterology. Our trainees are selected from a very large pool of outstanding applicants to these
clinical training programs. Special efforts have been undertaken to enhance our recruitment of women and
minorities, aided by recent structural changes to our program; and the mentoring of women and minority trainees
has thus become a major focus of the program. Dr. Timothy C. Wang is the PI and Director of this training
program, ably assisted by Associate Director Dr. Howard Worman; and both have actively mentored young basic
and clinical scientists for many years with superb track records in training. They are assisted by other members
of the Executive Committee and supported by both Internal and External Advisory Committees. Trainees have
a wide choice of mentors in basic GI, basic liver, or clinical/epidemiological research, and in addition to exciting
research projects, they also complete a rigorous program of didactic instruction that includes cross training and
multidisciplinary education. Many of our trainees will pursue training in Patient Oriented Research (POR) and
obtain a Masters (MSc) degree. Key milestones for our trainees include publications, especially first-authored
papers, and applications for career-development awards such as K awards and later R01 awards. The training
program and associated departments have a well-established seminar series and journal clubs/workshops,
career development and mentoring program, and an efficient feedback and evaluation system. In summary, this
is a highly successful research training program of physician-scientists in digestive and liver diseases."
10860071,"ABSTRACT
Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional death worldwide and lower limb prosthesis users (LLPUs)
constitute an exceptionally high-risk group. Over half of LLPU fall annually with many falls resulting in injuries.1
Despite these alarming statistics, clinically accessible tools for predicting falls in LLPU are currently lacking. A
comprehensive fall prevention research program should address barriers, such as population heterogeneity and
specificity of measurements, and identify modifiable biomechanical risk factors across LLPUs subgroups using
methods easily translatable into clinical use.4 Gait analysis to as a screening tool for falls has the potential to
satisfy these requirements and markerless motion capture makes it possible that routine gait analysis could be
feasibly integrated into routine clinical visits. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a sensitive and
specific fall screening protocol for lower limb prosthetic users that utilizes gait and kinematic analysis from
markerless motion capture and is applies to a representative population of lower limb prosthetic users. We will
work towards this objective by evaluating fall risk predictors from gait analysis and comparing their accuracy to
traditional performance-based clinical assessments. To do this, we will collect in clinic markerless motion capture
gait and kinematic data as well as common clinical assessments from 150 lower limb prosthetic users. We will
then collect prospective fall history from these individuals for 1 year to determine the subset of gait parameters
or clinical assessments that best predict an individual’s future fall risk. Finally, during this one-year collection
period, we will use wearable sensors to obtain further kinematic data on fall type, directionality, and
circumstances to develop a model for incident risk based on fall type. The results from this study will provide
important findings to predict fall risk for a representative, heterogeneous population of lower limb prosthetic
users. It will determine whether fall risk can be accurately predicted from 3D gait analysis using markerless
motion capture. If successful, our proposed work will produce a translatable approach for screening at-risk lower
limb prosthetic users and will identify biomechanical risk-factors for specific fall types. All models and tools for
this study will be made open source in our continued commitment to open access. Further, we anticipate that
our techniques may generalize to other populations at-risk for falls, such as older adults or stroke survivors.
Ultimately, we envision these tools being integrated into routine clinical encounters and a subsequent research
study testing whether fall-prevention interventions initiated from clinical gait analysis can reduce the frequency
of preventable falls."

Genetic linkage using recombinant progeny from controlled experimental crosses is a powerful tool for locating
the genetic determinants that control important phenotypes. We have perfected the methods for quantitative trait
loci (QTL) mapping of malaria parasite traits using the humanized mouse model and have optimized bulk
segregant analysis (BSA) for streamlined identification of loci and prioritization of genes in the locus for functional
validation. The recent emergence of artemisinin resistant (ART-R) parasites in East Africa hastens the need to
understand the genes and mechanisms of fit, drug resistant parasites. The looming crisis of spreading resistance
to ART combination therapies (ACT) across Africa hinges on unique features associated with different kelch13
mutations appearing in different locales with different propensities to expand in frequency. Current surveillance
is to monitor kelch13 mutants and to assess cumbersome clinical phenotypes such as patient clearance half-life
and the labor-intensive Ring Stage Survival assay (RSA). We will partner with African researchers to target this
emerging crisis by generating experimental crosses between parasite strains that differ for important ART-R and
ACT-related traits to map the location of the genes and their mutations that control these phenotypes. We will
use both BSA selections (Aim 1) and clone-based QTL mapping (Aim 2). By judicious choice of parental lines
for constructing targeted experimental crosses Aim 1 will combine BSA with refined selection schemes; we
hypothesize that we can rapidly characterize kelch13 mutations and their phenotypic impacts, as well as their
broader whole genome profile to inform and improve surveillance. In Aim 2, we will deploy a range of novel
phenotypes we developed in the initial funding period, including a high-throughput adaptation of the traditional
RSA, along with an expansion of dosing regimens and recovery times. Aim 3 will apply these approaches to
individual progeny growth rates and comprehensive pair-wise competitive fitness. Working in concert with Core
B, we will identify additional genes and mechanisms that contribute to fit forms of ART-R. This approach will
allow us to test hypotheses about resistance evolution and characterize partner genes and pathways affected
by drug selections and identify the factors that influence the origins and spread of resistance."
10863598,"Viruses interact with and hijack a vast array of cellular molecules and pathways to facilitate their multiplication
and spread, while also reprograming infected cells to release pathogenic viral factors (‘viral toxins’) that could
be independently targeted with vaccines and therapeutics to reduce disease severity. Given that virus-host
interactions can provide new and broadly shared Achilles’ heels against emerging viruses and inform the rapid
development of in vitro and in vivo models to test novel medical countermeasures, uncovering these interactions
is essential to pandemic preparedness. However, critical gaps exist in our foundational knowledge of the
mechanisms of viral infection and pathogenesis for nairoviruses, hantaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. The
overarching goal of Project 1 is to discover and dissect host factors and pathways critical for infection and
pathogenesis by our prototype viruses—Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Andes virus (ANDV),
and Menangle virus (MenPV)—and additional divergent viruses from these families. In Aim 1, our
interdisciplinary research team will discover and validate entry receptors and other critical host factors using
complementary CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic and time-resolved proteomic and phosphoproteomic screening
approaches, and selected hits will be assessed for their roles in infection and pathogenesis in vivo with gene-
edited rodent models of infection. Utilizing a suite of virological, cell-biological, and quantitative proteomics
assays, in Aim 2 we will elucidate the mechanisms by which our prototype viruses exploit validated host factors
and pathways, identify host interactors of viral proteins, and map the functional surfaces of viral and host proteins
confirmed to interact. These findings will be expanded to divergent members of each virus family. Finally, in Aim
3, our team will define the role of CCHFV and hantavirus glycoprotein-induced vascular leak in pathogenesis by
defining host factors and molecular interfaces essential for barrier dysfunction and identifying markers of
endothelial dysfunction in animal models and humans. Key deliverables of Project 1 include novel reagents,
including recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses and variable heavy chain-only antibodies to facilitate host
factor discovery and validation, and critical data to support immunogen engineering efforts in Projects 2–3,
antibody profiling and discovery in Project 4, and animal model development in Core D. This project will
contribute to PROVIDENT's objectives by generating fundamental knowledge about virus-host interactions that
influence nairovirus, hantavirus, and paramyxovirus infection, virulence, and pathogenesis."
10863599,"In Project 2 (P2) we will use cutting-edge antigen engineering to refine vaccine antigen design strategies through
iterative assessments of immunogenicity and protective efficacy to generate optimized vaccine immunogens
against nairo-, hanta-, and paramyxoviruses. Our approach will establish a protective antigen engineering
blueprint for emerging bunyaviruses and paramyxoviruses with pandemic potential. We will interact with the other
PROVIDENT projects and cores for antigen production (CC), animal efficacy testing (CD), mRNA vaccines (P3,
CE), and sharing knowledge and resources (CB, P1, P3, P4). Aim P2.1: Structure-based antigen design. We
will utilize an in-depth understanding of structural biology of viral surface proteins to design and express
recombinant viral antigens from a prototype nairovirus (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, CCHFV),
hantavirus (Andes virus, ANDV), and paramyxovirus (Menangle virus). Following optimization of antigen designs
for prototype viruses, design strategies will be applied to related but genetically distant outgroup viruses
(nairoviruses: Hazara virus; hantaviruses: Sin Nombre virus and Hantaan virus; paramyxoviruses: Sosuga virus
and Nipah virus) to validate that our vaccine design approach is applicable within virus families. Aim P2.2:
Antigenicity and protective efficacy of engineered antigens. We will vaccinate animals with recombinant antigens
designed in P2.1 and produced by CC and evaluate immunogenicity and in vivo efficacy against viral infection.
Following down-selection, lead antigens will be incorporated into mRNA vaccine platforms optimized by P3.
Comparative immunogenicity and in vivo efficacy studies will evaluate recombinant- and mRNA-based vaccine
platforms head-to-head. Based on results obtained using prototype viruses from each family, we will apply
antigen design strategies to outgroup viruses and evaluate immunogenicity and protective efficacy of lead
candidates in existing and/or novel animal models being developed by CD. Aim P2.3: Characterization of
humoral immune responses to engineered antigens. We will evaluate humoral immune responses to engineered
antigens using samples collected from animal studies (P2.2) using high-throughput, well-characterized assays.
We will use authentic and surrogate virus assays to rapidly evaluate neutralization potential and Fc-mediated
activity of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies. VH-VL antibody repertoires encoded by peripheral B cell
subsets will be identified using novel multivalent BCR-seq methodologies. We will also investigate correlates of
protection for lead CCHFV and ANDV vaccine antigens from P2.2 by executing B cell depletion studies with
support from CD. Aim P2.4: Evaluations of T cell responses to engineered antigens. We will perform in-depth
analyses of peripheral, tissue resident, and follicular memory T cell responses in vaccinated animals and will
conduct T cell receptor sequencing to identify the breadth and diversity of T cell responses post-vaccination. To
assess the role of T cells in protective efficacy, T cell depletion studies will be completed with support from CD.
This project will provide a roadmap to optimize vaccine immunogens for nairo-, hanta-, and paramyxoviruses."
10863600,"Abstract
RNA vaccines have dramatically altered the landscape of vaccine development, affording an unparalleled ability
to rapidly counteract emerging infectious diseases, as evidenced by the swift generation of effective RNA
vaccines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite these major achievements, there remain
substantial gaps, challenges, and limitations to RNA vaccines, especially reactogenicity and limited durability
and breadth of protection, requiring further research, development, and optimization. First, the selection of
appropriate sub-cellular targeting moieties is crucial to antigen expression, influencing the folding, processing,
and presentation of the expressed antigen to the immune system; the generalizability of these targeting motifs
across virus targets is an open question. Second, there is a need to balance reactogenicity and immunogenicity,
as RNA vaccines may precipitate dose-dependent adverse reactions while eliciting potent immune responses,
particularly in the context of multi-antigen RNA vaccination requiring higher total RNA doses. Finally, there is a
lack of knowledge regarding the generalization of antigen design and safety parameters across different virus
groups, both within a specific family and across broader taxa. Project 3 in the PROVIDENT consortium aims
to address these challenges with three specific aims. (1) The first aim is to optimize antibody responses to
RNA-encoded prototypic nairovirus, hantavirus, and paramyxovirus structural proteins, leveraging
high-throughput and structure-guided methodologies to screen for ideal cell-surface expression. These
optimized designs will be subsequently applied to related viruses; (2) The second objective is to ascertain
whether vaccine efficacy can be augmented by complementing antibody responses targeting the main
antigen with secondary immune responses to additional antigens, using a multi-antigen vaccine composition.
These multi-antigen designs will also be applied to related viruses; (3) The third objective is to characterize
the differential innate immune responses and reactogenicity profiles to RNA-encoded protein variants using
traditional mRNA, and next-generation self-amplifying replicon RNA platforms. This aim will provide crucial
insights into the reactogenic characteristics associated with RNA-encoded pathogenic proteins and virus-like
particles, delivered by a variety of platforms, as well as the safety profiles of lead vaccine candidates.
Anticipated findings from this project hold significant potential to contribute to the refinement of RNA
vaccine strategies, particularly concerning nairoviruses, hantaviruses, and paramyxoviruses but also
extending to other pandemic potential virus groups. Ultimately, this project will equip vaccine developers with a
robust toolbox and a predictable, rapid vaccine development road map against related viruses."
10863601,"Abstract: This proposal embodies the development of an advanced platform for rapid identification,
characterization, and optimization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to effectively combat nairoviruses,
hantaviruses, and paramyxoviruses. Our work is centered on comprehensive immune profiling of naïve and
convalescent donors, identifying and characterizing mAbs throughout disease progression. To identify mAbs, we
employ multivalent memory B cell sorting, Ig-Seq proteomics, naive B cell sorting, and antibody engineering
using eukaryotic display technologies. Our proposal includes a comprehensive study of immune responses to
catalog epitopes and immunodominance hierarchies, which will be instrumental in improving our understanding
of establishment and maintenance of prototypical protective humoral immunity to these viruses. This critical new
information will enable the design of next-generation vaccine candidates for these virus families. The second
aim focuses on the understanding of antibody-antigen interactions at the molecular level. This aim incorporates
high-throughput epitope mapping using state-of-the-art mammalian display technology, performed using deep
mutational scanning and epitope shuffling. In addition, we will explore potential viral escape mechanisms to
inform the design of broadly protective antibody cocktails. By combining cryo-electron microscopy, viral
mutational escape through forward genetics, and deep mutational scanning, we plan to visualize the escape
maps and understand how these viruses may evolve over time to avoid neutralizing antibodies elicited by
vaccines. The third aim is directed at optimizing mAbs for effective development and enhancing their protective
capabilities. Advanced machine learning algorithms and antibody engineering techniques will be used for
creating mAbs that are efficient to produce, stable, highly-affinity, and broadly protective. The algorithms will be
trained to predict and address potential sequence-based manufacturing and developability issues to optimize
mAb sequences for efficient expression and stability during production, purification, and storage. This aim
includes engineering bispecific mAbs and mAb candidates for serum stability, development of stable cell lines
during hit identification and optimization, and evaluation of virus neutralization and protective potential in relevant
animal models. The interplay of these three aims will facilitate a novel platform for rapid generation of high-
affinity, broadly protective, manufacturable, and serum-stable mAbs against prototypical viruses. This holistic
approach is expected to improve our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging biological threats,
provide crucial information to the design of efficacious vaccines in projects 2 and 3, and refine a platform for
countermeasures development. Our collaborative research team is comprised of experienced scientists with
expertise in immunology, virology, antibody/protein engineering, and machine learning. The team has a strong
track record and is well-positioned to make significant contributions to virology, immunology, and vaccinology.
This project will contribute to the overall goals of the PROVIDENT consortium by developing tools for designing
vaccines and providing a scalable countermeasures platform for future threats."
10831013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interferon-inducible GTPases are among the most potent effectors in cell-autonomous immunity. They are
dynamin-like large GTPases highly induced by proinflammatory cytokines, especially type I and II interferons.
Interferon-inducible GTPases eliminate or restrict intracellular bacteria and protozoan parasites through a variety
of strategies. The most prominent strategies are rupture of pathogen-containing vacuoles (PCVs) to expose
pathogens to cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and direct attack and lysis of bacterial membranes.
On the other hand, interferon-inducible GTPases are under tight control to avoid indiscriminate attack on host
cell endomembranes. The critical roles of IFN-inducible GTPases are gaining attention and appreciation recently,
yet the molecular mechanisms of their activation, their effector functions on target membranes, and their
regulation by cellular and microbial factors remain evasive. In this proposal, we study the activation and
regulation mechanisms of interferon-inducible GTPases using guanylate-binding protein 2 (GBP2) as the
prototype. In our preliminary studies, we purified GBP2, determined its crystal structures, and gained initial
insights into its structures and functions. In this research, we will take advantage of these preliminary data to
determine the structural and mechanistic basis of GBP activation in solution and on target membrane, and the
regulation mechanism by cellular and microbial factors. We will first elucidate GBP2 oligomerization status and
GTPase activity in solution. We will then determine the atomic structures of GBP2 in various nucleotide-bound
states using X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Next, we have modified GBP2
with farnesyl group and will characterize its interaction with lipids and liposomes. We will then determine the
remodeling/lysis effect of farnesylated GBP2 on its target membranes using fluorescence-based liposome
leakage assay and EM techniques. We also plan to characterize the higher-order assembly mode of membrane-
attached GBP2. Finally, we will define how GBP2 is self-inhibited and regulated by other cellular and pathogen-
derived proteins. Successful accomplishment of this proposed research will fill a major gap in our knowledge of
the molecular mechanisms of intracellular pathogen detection and restriction. This work will also expand our
understanding of activation and assembly of large GTPases in general. Ultimately, these findings will facilitate
the development of novel therapeutic strategies for microbial infections and autoinflammatory diseases."
10831014,"Project Summary: Accurate Molecular Decision Making during Protein Biogenesis
Accurate protein biogenesis is essential for the generation and maintenance of a functional
proteome. Our long term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which diverse
protein biogenesis pathways in the cell accurately select nascent protein substrates and ensure
their correct folding, localization, and maturation. Two major components define our research
program in this grant cycle.
First, we will use a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and in vivo experiments to decipher
the mechanisms by which nascent proteins emerging from the ribosome are selected and
processed by ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors (RPBs) in the crowded space of
the ribosome tunnel exit. These studies will include a new co-translational membrane protein
targeting pathway mediated by SecA, enzymes mediating N-terminal methionine excision on
nascent proteins in bacteria, and co-translational protein targeting mediated by SRP in the
mammalian system. In addition to studying the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms of the
individual protein biogenesis pathways, we will also elucidate how each of these factors
coordinates with other RPBs in space and time during ongoing translation, and how this
coordination reshapes the efficiency and fidelity of the individual pathways.
Second, we will decipher the mechanisms by which aggregation-prone membrane proteins are
effectively protected and facilely guided to the target membrane during their post-translational
targeting. These studies will use two membrane protein biogenesis pathways as models: (i) an
ATP-independent chaperone cpSRP43, which allows us to decipher, at biophysical resolution,
the molecular mechanisms by which a small chaperone effectively protects multi-pass
membrane protein clients and achieves spatiotemporal regulation of its client interactions in the
absence of ATPase cycles or cochaperones; (ii) the guided-entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET)
pathway, which provides an excellent system to decipher how a multi-component Hsp70-
cochaperone cascade protects, funnels, and triages nascent membrane proteins during their
targeted delivery. Investigation of the GET pathway will also allow us to gain insights into the
design and organizational principles of analogous chaperone networks in the cell.
The proposed experiments will not only generate high resolution understandings of the
individual protein biogenesis pathways, but also establish valuable tools, reagents to explore the
action of other protein biogenesis machineries. Most importantly, this research will generate
important conceptual frameworks to understand how nascent proteins are accurately selected
into their appropriate biogenesis pathways in the crowded cytosolic environment."
10831017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A leading cause of obesity and diabetes is consumption of a Western-style diet rich in saturated fat and simple
sugars. Recent research shows that high fat (HF)-high sugar diets alter the microbial composition of the gut.
Interestingly, we previously showed that HF diets have a strong impact on the small bowel microbiota specifically
in the jejunum, the major site of nutrient digestion and absorption. Moreover, jejunal HF microbes increased lipid
absorption in adult germ-free mice compared to low fat (LF) diet microbes collected from the jejunum. However,
in this study, we focused on the bacterial taxa as opposed to fungal taxa. A critical gap exists in the literature
regarding the role of fungi in regulating the absorptive capacity of the gut in response to HF diets. Our long-term
goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which candidate fungi such as Candida regulate lipid absorption, fat
transport and adiposity. The objective of this application is to determine the impact of Candida, in yeast or
hyphal form, on lipid digestive and absorptive capacity and obesity development. In addition, we will examine
the localization of Candida along the length of the gut. Our preliminary data demonstrate that C. albicans in yeast
and hyphal form triggers the upregulation of genes involved in fat absorption. Weekly supplementation of heat-
killed C. albicans also increased body weight gain in mice fed a HF diet and induced fatty acid translocase (Cd36)
expression in the jejunum. As emerging evidence suggests that diet-gut microbe interactions have the potential
to promote disease, we developed our central hypothesis that the gut mycobiota contributes to lipid absorptive
and digestive capacity in the small intestine. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1)
Test the localization and morphology of C. albicans and impact on host lipid uptake and obesity, Aim 2)
Determine the molecular mechanisms involved in C. albicans-mediated lipid absorption. We have only
reached the precipice of understanding how bacteria regulate nutrient digestion and absorption and even less is
known regarding the role of intestinal fungi. The proposed research is innovative and significant because it
will better define the small intestinal mycobiota, regional localization of Candida and better define the
mechanisms of host-microbe interactions that regulate absorption contributing to the development of obesity."

deeply profile biological samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (Ps), psoriatic arthritis
(PsA), primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Working closely with the
AMP AIM network, we will focus on the cohorts and clinical questions defined by the network of clinicians,
biologists and computational biologists together with industry and non-profit partners. For our Technology
Core, we selected leading-edge multi-dimensional technologies to deeply profile end organs as well as
peripheral blood from patients with autoimmunity. We assembled a team of investigators with expertise in each
disease and tissue type, and who have already demonstrated the ability to develop and implement high-
throughput pipelines to profile tissue and blood samples. To help us design and interpret the studies, we
recruited a team of collaborators and consultants with clinical expertise in each disease, with pathology
expertise in each tissue and with technical expertise in spatial profiling methods. In the first year, we will carry
out the pilot phase to optimize pipelines for: i) preserving and disaggregating tissues; ii) profiling single cells
using scRNA-seq/CITE-seq/TCR-BCR-seq; iii) profiling single nuclei by snRNA-seq/snATAC-seq; iv) preparing
tissues for two complementary, leading-edge methods for spatial transcriptomics (Visium) and transcript
imaging (MERFISH). We will iterate the protocols to optimize cell viability and yield, technical quality metrics
specific to each technology and the representation of all cell types. In year 2, we will run the full set of scaled-
up technology pipelines using ~50 samples per tissue type, and will assess data quality, site and batch effects
and technical artifacts to inform potential modifications for the single-cell pipeline. In Years 3-5, we will profile
the remaining ~1000 biopsies and ~1000 blood samples collected by the disease teams. We will develop a
computational pipeline for data pre-processing, primary biological analysis and quality metrics (including
technical and biological parameters at the scale of genes, cells and tissues) with customized features for each
tissue and disease. Our findings will be rapidly communicated within our Technology Core and across the
Network to the Disease Teams, Systems Biology Core, network committees overseeing the project, NIH, FNIH
and our industry and non-profit partners. We will also respond in real time to advancing changes in
technologies and work with the network to pilot and scale up critical methods. The result of the proposed
studies will be a set of multi-dimensional datasets that will be shared with the network and the larger
community, and provide a basis for cutting edge disease deconstruction and reconstruction across
autoimmune end organ pathologies and thus fulfill the vision of AMP-AIM."

This grant is in response to PA-22-176, an omnibus call from NIH, FDA, and CDC. Therein the FDA expresses
the need to develop computer modelling tools that help with regulatory decision making.
Sterilization is the terminal step of medical device development, and sterilization validation is a regulatory re-
quirement. We are developing a Monte Carlo modelling tool that can produce virtual dose maps for radiation
sterilization, thereby helping medical companies make important decisions about sterilization that will also affect
the regulatory pathway early in the medical device development cycle. As modelling only requires a CAD model
of the device and not a manufactured device (which is required for dose mapping at a contract sterilizer), mod-
elling can be used early to iterate on the design of the device and its packing. Such a modelling tool will allow
medical device companies to shorten and de-risk the design process with respect to sterilization.
Monte Carlo modelling libraries such as Geant4 have the ability to accurately model radiation transport and dose
deposition. Because of this, Geant4 is widely used in high energy physics and radiation treatment, but so far it
is rarely used for radiation sterilization. The reason for this is the lack of user friendliness, which stems from its
flexible architecture and the slow simulation speeds. Furthermore, Geant4 does not provide the ability to load
full CAD models, and thus makes it rather cumbersome to model entire medical devices.
In Phase I of this FDA SBIR grant, we showed that Geant4 can be deployed in the cloud. We have developed a
prototype of a web user interface to configure simulations and to review modeled results. Our cloud tool can load
full CAD models and accurately reproduce measured dose maps. We showed a 100x increase of simulation
speed compared to a single computer due to seamless scaling in the cloud.
In Phase II we will build on our accomplishments of Phase I and extend this tool to be capable of modeling dose
maps from X-ray and gamma sterilization. We will develop parametric radiation source models that can be cali-
brated with qualification data provided by the contract sterilizer. We will refine our user interface and give the
user the ability to compare the different radiation sterilization technologies. We will also implement the ability to
model virtual dosimeters to facilitate direct comparison with measurements. In user studies we will show that the
tool is user-friendly and can be used to streamline decisions necessary for regulatory filings.
Our modelling tool will be geared towards engineers at medical device companies and does not require an
advanced background in software engineering or radiation physics. Rather, the engineer will be guided through
simple steps through the simulation process. The engineer can review the results in a user-friendly viewer and
determine the dose uniformity ratio. We anticipate that our tool will offer significant benefits to the medical device
development community."

 Age-related loss of memory remains a disease for which there are no effective treatments.
Data suggests that an enzyme found in a specific region of the brain associated with memory,
phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), is increasingly expressed as humans age, and that levels of
key signaling molecules in the brain that are substrates for this enzyme decrease in tandem,
leading to the hypothesis that PDE11A is directly responsible for this effect. Our experiments with
mice lacking PDE11A revealed that these animals behave and reproduce normally and do not
suffer from the same age related loss of memory as their wild type littermates. This data
collectively leads to the hypothesis that PDE11A may be a valuable target for study as a means
to treat age-related loss of memory.
 There are no known potent and selective PDE11A inhibitors. A number of other PDE
enzymes are under investigation or have been studied for various psychiatric and
neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that this family can be targeted by small molecules. A
novel screening method using yeast that express human PDE11A identified a number of good
starting points. Some of these hits demonstrated excellent selectivity for PDE11A with the
potential to be optimized to provide the first potent, selective PDE11A inhibitors with a profile that
will allow us to investigate these compounds in mouse models of age-related behavior and
memory."
10830930,"Project Summary
Malaria remains an enormous problem, and drugs are of critical importance to treat episodes of malaria,
prevent disease in high risk groups, and limit transmission. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs),
mostly artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine, are the cornerstones of antimalarial therapy in
Africa. Standard chemoprevention approaches are intermittent preventive therapy with sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine (SP) in pregnant women and seasonal malaria chemoprevention with amodiaquine+SP in
children in the Sahel sub-region, and improved approaches are under study. In this context, antimalarial drug
resistance is of great concern. Resistance to ACTs, including both artemisinins and partner drugs, has
emerged in southeast Asia. Resistance to amodiaquine and SP is longstanding, but sensitivities vary, with
uncertain impacts on chemoprevention. Definitive studies in at risk populations of associations between
exposure to antimalarial drugs, treatment and preventive efficacy, and selection of drug resistance are needed.
This project will build on studies in Uganda during our first cycle of funding in which we characterized the
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of the ACT dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, the most promising
new agent for chemoprevention in Africa. Our goals will be broadened to gain insights into associations
between drug exposure, malaria outcomes, birth outcomes, and selection of drug resistance in the context of
the 3 primary indications for antimalarial drugs in Africa: treatment of malaria, chemoprevention in pregnancy,
and chemoprevention in children exposed to seasonal malaria. A guiding principal is that the best means of
preventing selection of drug resistance is to effectively treat and prevent malaria, as inadequate exposure to
antimalarial drugs increases risks for both drug sensitive and drug resistant malaria. Our studies will build on
our pharmacology expertise and longstanding collaborations between UCSF and malaria research groups in
Uganda and Burkina Faso. We will use rigorous PK assessments to test related hypotheses in children in
Uganda and Burkina Faso and pregnant women in Uganda that exposure to ACTs is associated with risks of
malaria and the selection of drug-resistant parasites. Better characterization of associations between drug
exposure and clinical and drug resistance outcomes will help us to optimize use of drugs for the treatment and
prevention of malaria. Specific aims will be: 1) to characterize associations between exposure to key ACT
partner drugs, clinical outcomes, and selection of drug resistance in Ugandan children treated for malaria, 2) to
evaluate associations between exposure to DP and SP and protection against malaria and adverse birth
outcomes in pregnant Ugandan women, and 3) to characterize associations between exposure to seasonal
malaria chemoprevention drugs and malaria outcomes in children in Burkina Faso. These studies will help to
identify regimens that offer optimal treatment and preventive efficacy against malaria with minimal selection of
antimalarial drug resistance."

This renewal application requests continued support for the Postdoctoral Research Training Program in
Substance Abuse Prevention at Yale University. The host site for the program will continue to be the Division
of Prevention and Community Research in the Yale Department of Psychiatry, along with two primary partner
sites in Psychiatry: the Division of Addictions and the Yale Stress Center. In addition, the program will continue
to draw on faculty in three other Yale sites: Women's Health Research at Yale, the Yale School of Public
Health, and the Yale Child Study Center. Faculty have a strong track record of scholarship in substance abuse
prevention and longstanding collaborations as researchers and mentors. This application builds on the success
of our current training program originally funded by NIDA in 2005 and renewed in 2010 and 2015. Our request
for renewal funding is based on the continuing demand for advanced training in rigorous, interdisciplinary,
community-based translational research focused on substance abuse prevention. The program trains six
postdoctoral fellows across two years: 1) to understand drug abuse and addiction and related behaviors within
an ecological framework that emphasizes relevant developmental, family, social, cultural, and neurobiological
contexts; 2) to enhance knowledge in pre-intervention, implementation, and dissemination research; 3) to learn
state-of-the-art data analytic methods that incorporate rigorous field and laboratory research methods,
including mixed method designs; 4) to gain experience in interdisciplinary research through collaborations with
scientists working in interdisciplinary teams across departments, centers, and programs; and 5) to increase
knowledge about the translation of research into real-world contexts in order to impact prevention practice and
policy, and ultimately, public health. These program objectives are reinforced in mentored relationships with
two scientific advisors, didactic seminars, and individually-tailored experiences based on each fellow’s
Individual Development Plan. The training aligns with NIDA research objectives and cross-cutting priorities.
Over the past 14 years, the program has enrolled 38 fellows, who have virtually gone on to careers as
prevention scientists. More than three-quarters are faculty in academic settings, and others are employed as
prevention scientists in interdisciplinary research organizations. The program has also been successful in
training fellows from diverse backgrounds; 26% identify as an underrepresented racial/ethnic minority and 13%
identify as other racial/ethnic minorities."
10831027,"Trophoblasts play an essential role in communication between the fetus and the mother. Failure to accurately establish the trophoblast lineage results in developmental arrest prior to the blastocyst stage, implantation failure, early miscarriage, and placental abnormalities. Recently, we made the first discovery of a novel DNA methylation on N6-adenine (N6-mA) in mammalian genomes (Wu et al., Nature, 2016; Xie et al., Cell, 2018). Our most recent preliminary studies have shown that N6-mA is predominantly present in the trophectoderm/trophoblast lineage of early embryos, and is conserved in the mouse and bovine and probably across all mammals. Alkbh1 (N6-mA demethylase)-deficient in mice die in utero due to loss of imprinted control and severe placental development defects in post-implantation embryos. Interestingly, ALKBH1 deficient bovine embryos have impaired trophoblast stem cell emergence and blastocyst formation. In addition, N6-mA abundance is remarkably high in trophoblast cultures differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells, providing an excellent model for studying N6-mA in human placentation. These results indicated that this novel epigenetic mark has both conserved and unique roles in trophoblast development in different eutherians. However, the molecular mechanism underlying N6-mA function, and its role in trophectoderm and trophoblast development remain elusive. The overall hypothesis is that N6-mA represents a novel epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression network directing determination of trophoblast cell fate. The overall objective of the proposed studies is to conduct a systematic, comparative study on trophoblast from mice and bovine embryos, as well as human trophoblast cell culture models, focusing on the role of N6-mA in trophoblast formation, gene expression and epigenetic reprogramming. Three independent and yet intellectually-related specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will characterize N6-mA function in trophoblast lineage differentiation and imprinted gene control with a trophoblast-specific conditional knockout mouse model. Aim 2 will investigate the role of N6-mA in trophoblast stem cell emergence and blastocyst formation in a bovine embryo model. Aim 3 will utilize human stem cell-derived trophoblast differentiation models to establish N6-mA functions in human placental trophoblast formation. This project leverages the expertise of the Jiang laboratory in embryo/trophoblast development and the expertise of the Xiao laboratory in epigenetic regulation to address fundamental questions in trophoblast lineage development. This study is innovative because it a) provides insight into the role of a novel DNA methylation mark in trophoblast lineage formation, b) sheds new light on epigenetic regulation of imprinted genes, a longstanding issue in placental development, and c) establishes novel, comparative embryo and cell culture models to understand the conserved and unique epigenetic regulation of trophoblast cell fate in eutherians. The proposed project is significant because it will improve our understanding of the molecular basis of early embryonic loss and clinical reproductive disorders that are associated with abnormal placentation."
10831028,"Fibrotic renal disease represents a major health care problem because of its prevalence and the fact that available therapies merely slow the progression of renal failure. New innovative therapies to slow or stop the progression to the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are urgently needed. It has been well established that inflammation is a key factor in the development and progression of renal fibrosis. However, it is impossible to reduce renal inflammatory reaction sufficiently by inhibiting a single inflammatory factor. Very recently, human antigen R (HuR), a mRNA-binding protein governing mRNA stability and translation, has been identified as a key modulator in immune response and inflammation through regulating mRNA stability of cytokines, inflammatory factors, and proteins critical for cell function and survival. Enhanced renal HuR translocation and activation has been observed in varied kidney diseases. Therefore, targeting HuR might provide us with an ideal way to against renal inflammation and thereby controlling renal disease progression. Importantly, we recently identified a specific HuR inhibitor, KH-3, which significantly ameliorated renal function and reduced proteinuria and renal fibrosis in the experimental glomerulonephritis model. Based on our exciting data, we hypothesize that inhibition of HuR function in renal cells with KH-3 will inhibit HuR-targeted genes that are critical for renal inflammation and fibrosis and thereby leading to remission of chronic kidney disease (CKD). To test our hypothesis, we will 1) examine the in vitro anti-fibrotic activity, target validation and mechanism(s) of action of KH-3 in rat and human renal glomerular mesangial cells and tubular cells stimulated by angiotensin II and TGFβ1, two major profibrotic mediators; 2) refine and optimize the dose/schedule, delivery method and off-targeting of KH-3 in vivo in rats with nephritis, compared with normal rats, based on PK/PD and MTD; and 3) Evaluate the therapeutic potential of KH-3 in vivo using animal models with progressive CKD related to glomerulosclerosis or tubulointerstitial fibrosis or both. Successfully carried out, our results will serve as an important basis for translation into the clinical setting with improved potential for patient care for those living with, or at the risk of, progressive CKD."

Despite the high prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), we have yet to develop
clinical interventions that can substantially slow or reverse the course of dementia. One of the most powerful
determinants of ADRD, educational attainment, remains poorly understood. To advance scientific understanding
of how, why, and for whom education relates to ADRD, we propose to build an interdisciplinary network of ADRD
scientists whose joint expertise is vital to achieving NIA’s goal to reduce educational disparities in ADRD:
population health scientists, with their expertise in the behaviors that shape dementia risk and resilience, and
ADRD researchers, with their expertise in the biology and neurocognitive aspects of ADRD. Our Network will
advance scientific understanding of how education relates to ADRD disparities by exploring the
socioeconomic, social, psychological, and biological mechanisms that shape resilience and risk and if these
patterns differ by race and ethnicity. Identifying and clarifying mechanisms is needed to inform interventions to
reduce educational disparities in ADRD. The NIH-funded longitudinal population-based studies that form the
core data resources linked to this network, and the Network’s leadership, are well suited to meet the broader
scientific aim. We will advance education and ADRD science by establishing an interdisciplinary Network
of new, emerging, and established ADRD scientists who will apply cutting-edge methods and techniques
from their respective disciplines to answer complex questions about the education—ADRD relationship. Our
Network will facilitate research collaboration and professional development via annual meetings, small
working groups, pilot awards, and workshops. Annual meetings and working groups will provide venues for new
and emerging ADRD scholars to develop collaborations with established ADRD scholars across disciplinary
boundaries and pilot awards will support collaborative research projects. Workshops will provide introductory
training in ADRD science and professional development in grant writing, and science communication. We will
disseminate Network products to the scientific and broader policy community that are discoverable and
user-friendly. We will develop a Network webpage and social media accounts to share recorded webinars,
Network-developed tools and user guides, solicit pilot projects, and highlight the work of our Network members
through infographics and short data briefs. The Network will be led by an interdisciplinary leadership team with
expertise in the data that undergirds the Network, population health disparities, and the clinical and biological
underpinnings of ADRD, thus bridging the social, clinical, and ADRD sciences, as well as the three nodes critical
to building our Network: ADRD, education, and diverse populations. Our Network will develop new and emerging
ADRD scholars, quickly integrate them into the field, and facilitate and elevate their scholarship to have high and
sustained impact in education and ADRD."

 Inflammaging, the chronic low-grade inflammation that characterizes aging is a likely consequence of a
dysfunctional relationship between the imbalanced microbiota and their metabolites with the host's immune
system. Inflammaging plays an increasingly important role in the rate of aging and age-related diseases. We
have shown that the elevation of succinate, an intermediate metabolite in citric cycle, was associated with
aging in both human and mouse which altered the gut microbiome by increasing the relative abundance of
pathobionts. Succinate elevation also activates the SUCNR1 to augment myelopoiesis and inflammation.
Mechanistically we showed that succinate increased IL-1β and TNFα in the serum and bone marrow, and
induced a 30-fold increase of Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression and a 50%
increase of granulocyte macrophage progenitors in bone marrow. Our preliminary data provided new
mechanistic proof that the interplay among gut microbes, altered metabolites and myelopoiesis contributes to
inflammaging. We now seek to advance this project by testing the following over-arching hypothesis that
targeting the gut microbiome and extracellular succinate receptor activation alleviate inflammaging. In Aim 1
we will determine the impact of succinate elevation on gut dysbiosis and host response in young and old WT
C57/B6 and IRAK1 KO mice and how these alterations regulate IL-1β-IRAK1 signaling to promote
inflammaging. Then we will use gnotobiotic, antibiotic treatment and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation to
determine whether reprogramming the microbiome alters the course of inflammaging. In Aim 2 we will use WT
and myeloid lineage-specific SUNCR1 KO mice determine whether the myeloid lineage cells are the key
mediators of succinate-stimulated myelopoiesis and inflammation. Finally we will determine whether succinate-
stimulated inflammation and myelopoiesis is IRAK1-dependent by conducting bone marrow transplant in WT
and IRAK1 KO from young to old mice and monitor the reconstitution of myeloid and lymphoid cells.
 The proposed study on aging-related succinate elevation on gut dysbiosis and SUCNR1 activation will
enable us to understand the causative changes in the intrinsic mechanisms of inflammaging and provide novel
target to alleviate inflammaging.
 Impact: This project directly addresses the NIA's RFA-AG-20-030 on “Microbiome and Aging: Impact
on Health and Disease” and provides information on age-related changes in the gut microbiome and how a
cross-talk between the host immune system and microbiota correlates to the local and systemic immune
responses."

During the production of therapeutic biologicals, glycosylation has been identified as a critical quality attribute
(CQA) that must be carefully monitored to ensure that the desired protein stability, immunogenicity, antibody
effector function, pharmacological safety and potency, and serum half-life are consistently obtained. Many
factors can affect the composition of the glycan chains during production, such as media, temperature,
dissolved gases, induction times, etc., and consequently variations in glycosylation are among the leading
causes of pharmaceutical batch rejection.
Currently, the characterization of protein glycosylation relies heavily on methods that employ chromatography
and/or mass spectrometry, which require a high level of expertise, are time-consuming and costly, and,
because they are challenging to implement during biologics production at-line, are generally performed only
post-production. In recognition of the continuing need for novel analytical technologies that can be used during
therapeutic production, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the adoption of new process
analytical methods (PAT) that offer mechanisms to design, analyze, or facilitate the measurement of process
parameters that affect CQAs. Here we propose to optimize and commercialize a simplified approach for
monitoring glycosylation features during glycoprotein production, which we call GlycoSenseTM, that is fully
aligned with the FDA PAT initiative.
The GlycoSense technology uses flow cytometry with glycan-specific reagents conjugated to multiplex beads
to provide a rapid, inexpensive, and easy-to-use method for monitoring protein glycosylation patterns. Flow
cytometry was chosen as the preferred platform because the data are statistically robust, the equipment is
relatively commonplace, the analyses consume very low quantities of sample, and it will enable Lectenz Bio to
leverage its proprietary expertise in producing carbohydrate-sensing reagents.
In preliminary studies reported here, GlycoSense performance metrics were established and published using
glycans and glycoprotein standards. In phase II, the technology will be optimized for monitoring glycosylation
changes during cell culture. This will result in GlycoSense kits that can be used for a variety of applications in
basic research and in biopharma."

 While pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of the pulmonary vasculature
associated with high morbidity and mortality, it also has multiple systemic manifestations affecting many
organs. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting respiratory and skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients
with PAH; however, loss of muscle mass has not been adequately studied in PAH. Loss of lean mass is
increasingly recognized in individuals with chronic conditions and when present, is associated with decreased
physical activity and worse outcomes. Our preliminary data shows that almost 42% of patients with PAH
enrolled in a prospective observational cohort had low lean mass and obese individuals had a higher
prevalence of low lean mass as compared to individuals with normal weight. Fat depots are metabolically
active and produce an array of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines that likely contribute to the muscle loss.
 We are proposing a comprehensive evaluation of lean mass in patients with PAH. First, in a prospective
cohort of patients with PAH, we will characterize the endophenotype of PAH patients with low lean mass and
identify the metabolomic signature of low lean mass which will provide us with insight into novel putative
pathways. We also aim to understand the role of epicardial adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of low lean
mass. We will assess the impact of low lean mass on patient-centered outcomes including quality of life,
physical activity, and hospitalizations. Second, we will identify radiographic features of muscles on thoracic
non-contrast chest CTs to allow for earlier and easier screening for low lean mass in patients with PAH. Finally,
we will conduct a small pilot study to explore the response of adiponectin and muscle oxygenation to a low-
resistance exercise intervention in patients with PAH. The results of this study will lay the foundation for
“personalized” interventions trial targeting low lean mass in PAH."

 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasingly prevalent and serious problem worldwide. Most often,
AMR arises from horizontal gene transfer (HGT), involving mobile genetic elements (MGE) such as plasmids
and phages. The human gut is a hotspot for both the evolution and spread of AMR; commensals serve as a
source of AMR for pathogens via HGT. Slowing the evolution and spread of AMR is both possible and necessary.
Knowledge about the evolutionary history of AMR development and dissemination in vivo is essential to facilitate
effective stewardship. Yet, this knowledge remains limited. Important aspects of AMR evolution become evident
only in complex environments and in the setting of diverse communities. We will study responses to antibiotic
exposure in the human gut microbiota in vivo, as well as in complex stool-derived subject-specific communities
in vitro, at high temporal resolution and using innovative approaches. We will link AMR and other MGE-
associated genes to their host core genomes using high throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)
and monitor these genes and elements in bacterial hosts before, during and after antibiotic exposure. The short
term-objectives of the proposed work are to characterize and assess the contributions of de novo mutations and
HGT to the spread and development of AMR in the human gut microbiota during antibiotic exposure. The long-
term objectives are to improve antibiotic stewardship by identifying critical events or transitions in the evolution
and dissemination of AMR in vivo, and the factors and conditions that make those events less likely.
Aim 1. Determine the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in the gut microbiota of healthy
humans. We will use Hi-C and metagenomic sequencing to resolve strain-level microbial genomes from stool
samples of 60 healthy adults collected over an 8-week antibiotic-free interval, prior to a ciprofloxacin exposure.
We will identify potential AMR genes and determine their distribution within core and accessory genomes, and
in association with mobile genetic elements.
Aim 2. Characterize the effects of ciprofloxacin on the abundance and mobilization of AMR genes in the
human gut microbiota in vivo. We will use Hi-C and metagenomic sequencing to assay stool samples collected
from the same 60 subjects during and after the ciprofloxacin exposure, and to characterize the composition and
dynamics of selective sweeps that affect the emergence of AMR.
Aim 3. Characterize the effects of ciprofloxacin on the mobilization of AMR genes in synthetic, human
gut-derived microbial communities in vitro. We will propagate pre-exposure fecal communities ex vivo from
all 60 subjects, as well as generate complex, synthetic communities from pre-exposure samples of 5 subjects,
and then passage both bulk and synthetic communities anaerobically under multiple ciprofloxacin regimes. We
will identify factors and conditions that affect emergence of AMR through HGT and de novo mutations in vitro."

People with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have a shorter lifespan and higher morbidity and mortality than
the general population, with cardiovascular conditions on top of the leading causes. Brain imaging research has
revealed accelerated age-related brain changes in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However,
neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia are typically brain-focused without system-level investigations on the risk
factors. The causes of the exaggerated body and brain aging in schizophrenia is still largely unexplained, making
it difficult to provide more effective screening and management for the devastating medical consequences for
people suffering from schizophrenia. There are likely missing opportunities as vascular contributions to brain,
especially white matter health, are well established in the general population. The goal of the current proposal is
to utilize the standard but state-of-the-art vascular biology measures, combined with cutting-edge brain imaging
that is informative of the underlying mechanisms, to study the potential vascular contributions to the accelerated
age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases in schizophrenia. We will compare various vascular biomarkers
and between vascular and stress factors, to identify the key body-brain paths that may explain the reason that
schizophrenia spectrum disorders are associated with such high age-related medical and brain burden. The
study may provide insights into the timing and mode for more effective screening, prevention and treatment
effort."

Water contamination is one of the biggest public health concerns of the day. Chemical contamination of
drinking water can lead to a wide range of chronic adverse health impacts including cancer and developmental,
neurological, and reproductive damages. Populations worldwide are exposed to a myriad of chemicals, which
have been recently classified as emerging contaminants (EC), via drinking water. These ECs originate from
personal care products, pesticides, plastics, and a numerous array of emissions to the environment. Only a
handful of ECs have been extensively evaluated regarding human exposures and health impacts. There is a
paucity of knowledge on emergent water contaminants in terms of their impact on human health. Data-driven
environmental health sciences (EHS) research brings hope to fill this knowledge gap. However, this hope will
not be completely fulfilled if the data is not FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). Without
FAIR data, it would be very challenging to integrate diverse types of exposure related data that are
heterogenous in format and structure and are difficult to find. To make data FAIR to enable integrative
exposure studies, it involves the following objectives: i) open development, extension, adoption, and
refinement of data and metadata standards, ii) software tools to implement standards, and iii) engagement with
the stakeholders across different communities. This proposal leverages scientific use cases to engage with the
EHS and data science communities to achieve these objectives. It assembles a multidisciplinary team of
biomedical researchers, environmental science and engineering experts, and data scientists. The proposed
use cases represent complementary types of EC exposure studies. We will utilize these use cases as a
foundation to develop strategies to tackle the complex data integration challenge. It entails the following
specific aims.
1. Creating rich machine-readable metadata as part of developing a minimum information standard for
 environmental exposure assessment.
2. Annotating, mapping, and extracting data with the use of ontologies and common data elements (CDEs)
3. Harmonizing exposure related data with a graph model to build an environmental exposure knowledge
graph.
4. Engaging the user community through expert panels, workshops, social networking, and NIEHS-sponsored
meetings.
5. Evaluating the impact of the proposed project using appropriate metrics including user surveys,
 assessment of data FAIRness, usability, and NLP evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
 and F-measures."

Despite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE)
remain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a
multidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have
expertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we
have assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy,
and toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of
toxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease,
providing insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with
these therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies
have little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more
complex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted
therapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine,
genetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for
comprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of
this U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately
identifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and
clinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data
analysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients
experiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry
(CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and
cellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database
to integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity
data, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical
and clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging
from our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort,
eventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims
directly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti-
tumor efficacy."

institutional support will allow a seamless transition into the next cycle. Going forward, the increasing diversity
of the Intermountain West will provide unique access to participants unrepresented in research: rural and
frontier populations, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities. PHN
Utah is ideally positioned to contribute to a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive PHN focused on addressing
health care inequities and the 2 specific pillars to support transformational impact: 1) addressing existing
inequity in clinical outcomes and 2) big data/data science using existing infrastructure. PHN Utah will expand
their successful collaboration with Utah’s Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium to develop a robust
mechanism for extracting and sharing pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records
across all PHN sites and use a robust Artificial Intelligence platform to explore the complex interplay between
phenotype; genotype; maternal, clinical, social determinants of health (SDOH), and racial/ethnic factors; and
clinical outcomes. Our aims are to 1) enhance PHN Utah’s exemplary performance and leadership by building
on prior experience with a new vision and additional expertise and infrastructure informed by lessons learned
from PHN leadership roles, collaborations, and studies, 2) address EDI issues in all aspects of research and
training to amplify successes in mentoring the next generation of researchers in an increasingly diverse and
inclusive research environment, and 3) create the PHN Data Resource consisting of clinical, genomic, and
SDOH data to empower equitable, personalized outcomes prediction. PHN Utah is committed to the overall
mission of the PHN, has a proven track record of contributions to the success of the PHN, effective leadership
locally and within the PHN, strong institutional support, proven mentorship of the next generation of physician
scientists, and will add significant resources to address equity and diversity, and provide existing infrastructure
to support a big data approach to personalized medicine."
10842274,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Nr2f nuclear receptors are essential for the formation of the facial primordia and for patterning the upper
jaw, though their specific role(s) remain incompletely defined. Zebrafish suffer a broad spectrum of phenotypes
with nr2f loss of function, ranging from a striking upper-jaw-to-lower-jaw transformation in nr2f2/5 double
mutants, to a severe reduction of the pharyngeal arches and an almost total loss of facial skeleton in quadruple
nr2f1a/1b/2/5 and nr2f2/5/6a/6b mutants. In mice, preliminary data show that early conditional ablation of Nr2f1/2
in the cranial NC (CNC) results in a similar hypoplasticity of the pharyngeal arches and a severe reduction in the
dorsal facial skeleton. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the Nr2fs function in at least two
discrete steps of CNC development: First, they are predicted to confer ectomesenchyme fate to a subset of CNC
via activation of Twist1. Loss of Nr2f function appears to cause this population of CNC to die instead. To test this
model, the fellowship candidate will compare expression of Twist1 and its downstream targets in mouse mutants
and controls and attempt rescue of the fish mutant phenotypes with twist1a misexpression in the neural crest.
He will perform lineage-tracing experiments in both fish and mice to determine when loss of CNC occurs and
use a combination of whole mount in situ and immunofluorescence experiments to examine possible causes.
The results of these experiments will be bolstered with RNA-Seq of FACS-sorted mutant mouse CNC.
Completing this portion of the proposed study will add the Cre-lox conditional mutation system to his ~3 years of
experience in mouse genetics, train him in zebrafish genetics, and provide broad experience in modern imaging
techniques. Second, the Nr2fs are proposed to pattern post-migratory CNC ectomesenchyme to make the
skeletal structures of the upper jaw distinct from those of the lower jaw. There is evidence for this later patterning
role in zebrafish, but early CNC loss in the conditional mouse mutants has confounded attempts to determine
conservation of function. To separate this putative patterning role from the earlier NC role, the candidate
proposes to use a later-acting Cre driver to ablate Nr2f1/2 and then to examine conditional mutants for homeotic
jaw phenotypes. He will also perform RNA-Seq on post-migratory CNC in these mutants to determine whether
a different set of targets is dysregulated at this later stage, consistent with these Nr2f roles being discrete.
Together, the proposed studies will train the candidate in a wide range of laboratory techniques and analyses,
preparing him for future research as an independent PI. Consistent with the stated mission of the NIDCR, this
study will add to the body of knowledge on neural crest development and craniofacial anomalies, laying the
groundwork for future development of non-surgical therapies to ameliorate patient conditions."
10842275,"Project Summary
Regulated transcription of genes is essential for cell proliferation, differentiation and
viability. Any misregulation may lead to a disease or a developmental abnormality. The
transcription cycle of eukaryotic genes consists of multiple steps. The accomplishment
of each of these steps requires a number of accessory factors. The initiation of
transcription by RNAPII requires gene-specific factors and the general transcription
factors (GTFs). The conventional view is that the general transcription factors (GTFs)
operate exclusively at the initiation step of transcription. Many recent studies have
challenged this dogma. The successful execution of the transcription cycle requires
some GTFs to function at the termination step as well. Evidence from my laboratory
and others has demonstrated that the general transcription factor TFIIB has an
evolutionarily conserved role in termination of transcription. My laboratory has further
implicated TFIIB in promoter directionality. Our preliminary results strongly suggest that
the mechanistic basis of TFIIB action is, in both cases, dependent on its ability to
interact with the termination factors and facilitate their recruitment on the gene. An
investigation into the role of TFIIB in termination and directionality is critical to
understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and may provide clues into the
role TFIIB plays in several diseases. The overall objective of this application is to
determine the prevalence and the molecular basis underlying termination of
transcription and promoter directionality by TFIIB. The central hypothesis of this
application is that TFIIB is involved in termination and promoter directionality of at least
a subset of genes. We propose that these apparently unrelated processes rely on the
ability of TFIIB to recruit termination factors. To accomplish the objectives of the
proposal, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Genomewide analysis of TFIIB
functions in termination and promoter directionality; (2) Elucidate the molecular basis
underlying role of TFIIB in termination and promoter directionality; (3) Purification and
characterization of the holo-TFIIB complex. The successful completion of this proposal
will enable us to comprehend the role of transcription factors in the broader context, and
will serve as a paradigm for understanding the coordination among steps of the
transcription cycle in yeast and mammalian systems."
10842277,"Abstract
CD8 T lymphocytes are the major mechanism by which the immune system eliminates cancers and virally
infected cells. CD8 T cells detect these abnormal targets by recognizing immunogenic (e.g. viral or mutant)
peptides displayed on MHC I molecules. Cancers and viruses can evade immune control and elimination by
inhibiting MHC I antigen presentation, making them harder to detect, and/or by expressing molecules, such as
PDL1, that inhibit attacking T cells. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which tumors
dysregulate these processes, how this affects cancer progression and immunotherapy, and how to reverse the
immune evasion to improve outcomes - these are the overall goals of this proposal. Our proposal is based on
our discovery in an unbiased forward genetic screen, of a transcription factor, IRF2, that unexpectedly is a
positive regulator of MHC I antigen presentation and a negative regulator of PDL1 (CD274) expression. Our
first aim will test the hypotheses that loss of expression of IRF2 is one of the ways that cancers escape
immune surveillance and control to progress and that this is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Our
second aim will test the hypotheses that the loss of IRF2 impairs the success of immunotherapy and that IRF2
will provide a much-needed biomarker to identify patients who would benefit, or not, from immunotherapy. The
rational for this hypothesis is that the reduction in MHC I antigen presentation caused by loss of IRF2, will
impair the ability of CD8 T cell responses that are invigorated by checkpoint blockade to find and kill their
cancer targets. Our third aim hypothesizes that the loss of IRF2 expression is due to epigenetic silencing. Our
goal is to determine the underlying mechanism for loss of IRF2 expression and to develop approaches to
reverse the immune evasion caused by the loss of IRF2 that can be translated into future clinical trials. Our
experimental approaches will use IRF2 gain of function and loss of function models, together with humanized
and IRF2 KO mice to define the role of IRF2 in tumor immune evasion and responsiveness to immunotherapy
with checkpoint blockade for both human and mouse cancers (Melanoma, NSCLC, & MCA sarcomas). We will
translate these findings into human cancer patients, evaluating whether IRF2 is a biomarker that can predict
clinical course and/or responsiveness to immunotherapy. Support for our hypotheses and feasibility of the
proposed experiments are supported by strong preliminary data. Finally, we will use bioinformatics, seq
techniques, inhibitors and cytokines to elucidate how IRF2 expression is lost and how to circumvent this loss
for therapy."

10842433,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This focused technology research and development project will deliver a new class of acoustic separation/en-
richment tools for multiple biomedical research applications. Acoustic microfluidics has emerged as a key ena-
bling technology in biology and medicine, providing unmatched capability for non-contact, label-free object ma-
nipulation and analysis. The proposed microfluidic platform is based on a novel concept: a longitudinal standing
bulk acoustic wave (LSBAW) subunit that controls micro- to nanoscale objects for functional separation and/or
confinement. The patented LSBAW subunits are highly configurable, which allows arrays of repeated subunits
to meet varying capacity and throughput needs, from monitoring/detection in small-volume (sub-µL) reaction
chambers to high-throughput enrichment of rare species. Outcomes of this project will include purpose-built
prototype systems for: (i) high-throughput enrichment/fractionation, (ii) process control at high capacity, and (iii)
multiplexed analyses with real-time monitoring. To establish the versatility and utility of the LSBAW platform,
different configurations will be validated in research applications of value to, for example, cancer biologists (rare
cell enrichment), synthetic biochemists (antibody conjugate synthesis on ultrasound-confined reaction sub-
strates), and microbiologists (monitoring/measurement of biological mechanisms in bacterial cells). The technol-
ogy outcomes of this project will be relevant not only to those applications, but will be broadly applicable to any
field that relies on separation, isolation, and enrichment. The project includes three Aims:
Aim 1: Demonstrate scalability of LSBAW subunits for high-volume, high-throughput enrichment of rare species.
Aim 2: Validate series configurations of LSBAW subunit arrays for high-capacity cell modification/labeling or
custom biomolecule synthesis.
Aim 3: Validate multiplexed configurations of LSBAW subunit arrays for quantification and/or detection of a
target species or biological mechanism.
Validation experiments will be used to rigorously assess capabilities that are relevant to specific applications.
Use of standard models (e.g., microparticles as proxies for biological cells) or well-characterized biological sys-
tems (e.g., commercial antibodies; standard mammalian cell lines, mixtures of cells, and microbes) will ensure
consistency and reproducibility of results. In each application, success will be defined using quantitative perfor-
mance criteria (e.g., throughput, capacity, specificity, sensitivity) and comparison with appropriate existing tools
and methods. The team merges expertise in microfluidics, synthesis and characterization of imaging agents,
microbiology, and rare cell isolation/analysis, with strong track records of technology development and deploy-
ment. Completion of these aims will translate a novel acoustic microfluidics concept to a suite of powerful and
broadly accessible research tools that will accelerate research in a multitude of biomedical research fields."

10843301,"GENETIC COUNSELING SHARED RESOURCE
ABSTRACT
The Genetic Counseling Shared Resource (GC) facilitates basic science, clinical, and behavioral research
necessary to translate genetic discoveries into clinical care. GC has provided clinical genetics services and
supported genetic research at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) since 2003 (supported by the Cancer Center
Support Grant since 2009) and has been directed by Wendy Kohlmann, MS, CGC, since 2006. GC is
quintessential to HCI’s mission and builds on HCI’s long history of gene discovery by leading practice-changing
research endeavors to determine the clinical utility of genetic testing, optimal methods for risk communication
and delivery of genetic counseling, and strategies to manage risk conveyed by inherited cancer
predispositions. GC is integral to a major goal of the Cancer Center, bringing scientific discoveries to the clinic
and into applications for the population. GC provides several key services necessary for translational genetic
research, including identifying cohorts of patients for gene research or studies of syndromes; helping
investigators design studies to optimally incorporate genetic information and to anticipate and address ethical,
legal, and social issues related to genetic analysis; providing genetic counseling interventions; and collecting
clinical phenotypes and longitudinal outcomes data. The aims of GC are 1) to provide cancer genetics
expertise, genetic counseling services, and interventions, and 2) to support the scientific research objectives of
the Cancer Center, especially in the context of translation of genetics to the clinic and population.
Access to research genetic counseling services has allowed Cancer Center members to study novel
approaches for providing genetic information and to include participants across our catchment area, the State
of Utah. GC adds value to the Cancer Center by ensuring genetics expertise is available to all Cancer Center
members and clinical investigators. The broad impact of GC across HCI is indicated by its contribution to 61

10842573,"Abstract
During embryonic development each body part is programmed to contain an accurate number and arrangement
of cells. This accuracy is achieved through precise integration of cell proliferation with other morphogenetic
programs. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reveal the physical principles that ensure accurate control
of the cell cycle and morphogenesis during Drosophila embryonic development. We will investigate how the
integration of the cell cycle oscillator and cytoskeleton leads to generation of the forces that drive nuclear
positioning. We will investigate how cytoplasmic flows are generated by cortical actomyosin contractions to
reveal novel and quantitative insights on the physical properties of the cytoplasm. Using several biosensors for
the main kinases driving the cell cycle, we will study how these activities are integrated to ensure proper cell
cycle control. We will also elucidate how transcriptional regulation of cdc25string ensures precise regulation of the
timing of mitosis during gastrulation. Specifically, we will dissect the mechanisms controlling mitotic domains on
the dorsal side of the embryos, where they are directly linked to the dynamic of the Decapentaplegic (Dpp)
morphogen gradients. Collectively, our experiments will define a quantitative framework elucidating how the cell
cycle and morphogenesis are regulated accurately during embryonic development."
10842676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Microbes are a constant presence in our environment and impact humanity in diverse ways. In particular,
infectious diseases caused by endemic, emerging, and zoonotic pathogens result in millions of human deaths
per year. However, we only poorly understand the many mechanisms that hosts have evolved to defend
against pathogens and that pathogens have counter-evolved to defeat those defenses. Importantly, the result
of these host-pathogen evolutionary conflicts (i.e. whether the host or the pathogen is successful) ultimately
determine our susceptibility to infection. It is therefore of paramount importance that we address the following
questions: what are the critical genes and mechanisms that protect us from infection from circulating and
zoonotic pathogens, how do pathogens counteract those defenses, and how does host genetic variation affect
susceptibility to infection? Our research brings an evolution-guided perspective to answering these questions
by exploiting natural diversity in host and microbial genomes to identify genetic innovations that have been
driven by host-microbe interactions. One motivating insight for this approach is the fact that the interests of
pathogens and their hosts are necessarily at odds with one another. That is, if the host successfully defends
against a pathogen, there is evolutionary pressure on the pathogen to evolve a way to overcome that defense.
Likewise, if the pathogen establishes a successful infection, the host is pressured to adapt. These back-and-
forth dynamics drive constant innovation on both sides of host-pathogen molecular interactions, resulting in the
wide genetic and functional diversity we see today. Our research explicitly leverages this diversity to discover
which host proteins have been driven to rapidly evolve by genetic conflicts with pathogens, in effect allowing
pathogens to lead us to the host genes, mechanisms, and pathways that are most important for fitness. Our
prior work highlights the utility of this approach by identifying several novel mechanisms in host innate
immunity. Based on these evolution-guided insights, our current work focuses on the importance of several
incompletely understood post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms in host antiviral
defense. At the same time, we will continue to use comparative genomics, virology, and biochemistry to
identify other rapidly evolving novel mechanisms in innate immune defenses. Finally, we are using a related
evolution-guided approach to discover functional innovations in animals that result not just from adaptation to
microbial conflicts, but also from direct co-option of microbial genes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The
overall mission of our work is to use an evolution-guided multidisciplinary approach to provide unique insights
into mechanisms of host defense and pathogen immune evasion, species-specific barriers to pathogen
replication and cross-species transmission, and microbe-driven evolution of cellular functions."
10842744,"Project Abstract
The goal of this work is to develop a universal toolkit to facilitate detailed mapping of interactions within the
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome, and interactions between the GI microbiome and host cells. The successful
completion of the proposed research will enable the prescriptive manipulation of the GI microbiome to achieve
desired physiologic effects – advancing the fundamental understanding of what constitutes a “healthy” GI
microbiome. Clinicians and researchers have established clear qualitative correlations between GI microbiota
composition and various aspects of human health. While scientists have made great progress in observing
genotypic and phenotypic outcomes of the GI microbiome, researchers and clinicians do not know how to
prescriptively alter (or induce) the GI microbiome to achieve a desired effect. To accomplish this objective will
first require a detailed understanding and map of the myriad interactions between GI bacteria, in addition to the
microbiome and the host – both of which are currently unrealized. This is due in part to the lack of domesticated
bacteria (i.e., less than 1%) from the GI microbiome, and the lack of universal tools that can be used to study
various interactions (selectively and systematically) across species, phylum, and kingdom.
To resolve the gaps in knowledge and related technical ability, over the next 5 years this research will concentrate
on domesticating an additional 2-5% of the GI microbiome (20-50 bacterial species), focused on three major GI
phyla – i.e., Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Domestication will include universal tool development
enabling programmable gain-of-function and loss-of-function within a given bacteria and between bacteria in
defined mock microbial communities. The toolkit will consist of two fundamental operations – (i) synthetic
decision-making, and (ii) synthetic memory – that can be deployed in a multiplexed format for concurrent and
sequential experimental assessment of interactions between cells. Decision-making will facilitate the
programmed regulation of coding and non-coding RNA via a reversible (or transient) modality – e.g., enabling
ON-OFF-ON and OFF-ON-OFF operations. Programmable synthetic memory will facilitate inheritable changes
that will enable mimicry of horizontal gene transfer and evolution within the microbiome. Finally, this research
will enable the development of mock ecosystems to facilitate the general study of microbe host (organoid)
interactions. The bottom-up construction of mock ecosystems will permit the investigation of reduced complexity
assemblages with greater control increasing the ability to define specific interactions and result in faster and
more robust outcomes."
10842745,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is fundamentally important to multicellular life. Focal
adhesions (FAs) are the best characterized cellular structures involved in cell-ECM adhesion, and not only serve
as physical couplings but are important centers of signal transduction. While FAs are well- known and well-
characterized for being enriched in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine
content of FAs is three times higher than phosphotyrosine. Despite this, the kinases that mediate these
modifications and the mechanisms and consequences of their function are poorly understood. We have found
that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a venerable kinase with hundreds of targets throughout the
cellular landscape, is present and active within FAs. Moreover, we have found that PKA binds directly to talin, a
critically important mechanosensitive FA scaffolding protein, in a manner that requires conformational unfolding
of talin. These observations suggest that talin is a mechanically-gated A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) that
couples cellular tension to PKA signaling within FAs. Here, we propose to use biophysical, biochemical, and cell
biological approaches to characterize the regulation and function of this new axis of localized
mechanotransduction. We will delineate how (1) molecular and cellular mechanics regulate the PKA-talin
interaction; (2) PKA-mediated phosphorylation regulates the function and interaction of talin, TAPs, and other
FA proteins; (3) disrupting talin-PKA interaction and associated signaling events impact cell adhesion, cell
spreading, and cell migration; and (4) cell adhesion and contractility regulate FA PKA activity. These
investigations will not only reveal new facets of adhesion-dependent signal transduction, but will also identify
FAs as a new, discrete niche for PKA function and establish a paradigm for mechanical regulation of this
ubiquitous kinase that may play a role in other mechanosensitive cellular structures and events."

distribute consistently high-quality cultured sea hares, Aplysia californica, for biomedical research and
education and to improve the usefulness of this model system by applied research. Aplysia has played a vital
role in fundamental discoveries of how cellular and molecular changes in the nervous system underlie basic
behaviors, learning, and memory, due to unique characteristics of the simple nervous system that provide an
ideal model system for such studies. The 3 aims of the proposed continuation of this Resource program are:
 1. Animal Culture, Distribution and Health Monitoring – The Resource will continue to culture A.
californica and make all life stages, from eggs to large adults, available to researchers at a reasonable cost.
We anticipate sales will continue at a level of 8,000-10,000 animals per year. We will also accommodate
requests by users for separately reared cohorts, specialized diets, or harvesting of specific tissues for RNA or
DNA. We will monitor naturally occurring Aplysia abyssovirus (AAbV) in cohorts to better understand the
potential impacts of this virus and to provide information about virus levels to users. In addition, we will make
available additional specialized animals as developed in our Applied Research programs.
 2. Curation and Informatics – An improved system for management of stocks from egg laying throughout
the lifespan will be created and made publicly available through a web interface. The established website will
be enhanced to include additional content on uses of the Aplysia model system for human health research and
teaching. Our online ordering system will be improved. Training opportunities for graduate students,
undergraduate teaching labs, and public outreach activities using Aplysia will be expanded and enhanced.
 3. Applied Research – We will conduct two applied research projects that will expand the usefulness of this
model system. 3.1 Developing Aplysia as a model of enhanced susceptibility of the aged to cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) – Aplysia is hypoxia-resistant, and likely has adaptations to resist IRI. Markers
of IRI, such as variations in mitochondrial function, will be studied in abdominal ganglia exposed to ischemia
and ischemia plus reperfusion. We will also examine the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI.
Developing this model may allow users to investigate the impacts of IRI on neural excitability and may lead to
novel avenues of research and innovation in therapies. 3.2 Developing Aplysia as a model to study enhanced
susceptibility of the aged to myocardial IRI – Impacts of IRI on cardiac function as well as other IRI markers will
be studied. As above, the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI will be investigated. This aim will
begin to pinpoint what adaptations Aplysia heart employs to mitigate hypoxic damage, and if those adaptations
persist as an organism ages. Developing Aplysia as a cardiac model will potentially expand this model
organism to uses beyond the nervous system."
10849635,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Building the cerebral cortex requires the spatial and temporal orchestration of molecular signals across neural
progenitor cells. Each of these cells is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a medium rich in health- and growth-
promoting factors whose composition changes profoundly across days during brain development. The choroid
plexus (ChP) is likely to strongly contribute to this dynamic developmental regulation of CSF composition, but
the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Here, we will use a suite of modern tools to test the
hypothesis that elevations in calcium concentration in embryonic ChP epithelial cells in response to
extrinsic cues is critical for regulating synthesis and secretion of signaling factors into the CSF. Calcium
activity regulates transcription and secretion in diverse cells ranging from neurons to salivary gland epithelia. We
identified receptors expressed in ChP epithelial cells that mediate calcium entry into the cell, such as the TRPM3
receptor, or that drive calcium release from internal stores, such as the 5HT2C receptor (Htr2c) for serotonin (5-
HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine). Our preliminary data suggest that 5-HT regulates embryonic ChP calcium
activity, transcription, and vesicle release, and that intact signaling via the 5HT2C receptor in ChP is
essential for normal cerebral cortical development. Further, maternal delivery of a selective agonist for the
5HT2C receptor triggers rapid, robust immediate early gene expression in embryonic ChP. Thus, we propose
that ChP calcium activity triggered by signals that activate the 5HT2C receptor (and other receptors such
as TRPM3) regulates ChP transcription and secretion of signaling factors into the CSF and controls
body-brain and maternal-fetal interactions, thereby tightly orchestrating cerebral cortical development.
To test this, we will first investigate the effects of 5HT2C and TRPM3 receptor activation by direct application of
ligand to the apical surface of epithelial cells during calcium imaging in ChP explants (Aim 1a) and by stimulation
of the basal surface following intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of ligands to the maternal dam during in vivo two-
photon calcium imaging of attached embryos (Aim 1b). We then assess the transcriptomic impact of such
stimulation (Aim 1c), and test whether embryonic ChP calcium activity via activation of 5HT2C receptors and
other receptors triggers vesicle release and protein secretion in vitro (Aim 2a) and in vivo (Aim 2b). We will also
analyze the effects of disruption of ChP receptor signaling on cortical development (Aim 3a). Disrupted CSF
volume, composition, and ventricle formation are common to many neurological conditions. Perturbations in
maternal-fetal health can disrupt brain development, in part via dysregulation of serotonergic and other signaling
pathways. Our findings provide a novel platform for elucidating the mechanisms underlying dysregulation of brain
development by environmental perturbations, thereby providing a conceptual and technical roadmap for future
studies on how activity in ChP epithelial cells influences gene expression and protein secretion, with
consequences for many neurodevelopmental diseases."
10849667,"Breastfeeding provides unique and profound maternal and infant health benefits. If 90% of US parent-
infant dyads breastfed exclusively for the first six months and supplemented through 12 months, 2600 excess
maternal deaths and 721 infant deaths could be averted each year. Despite these substantial health benefits
conferred by breastfeeding, only 45% of US birth parents meet this 6-month goal, and parents of color and
those in low income families face additional barriers to breastfeeding success, resulting in double the risk of
infant morbidity and mortality. Clinically-integrated breastfeeding peer counseling (ci-BPC) has been shown to
effectively promote racial and economic equity in breastfeeding outcomes. Despite the demonstrated
effectiveness of ci-BPC, there remain critical knowledge gaps regarding program design and costs. Thus, the
scientific objective of this K01 application is to evaluate the implementation of an effective ci-BPC program
and determine the essential program activities, identify significant patient-level and contextual factors relevant
to implementation, and determine the economic impact of ci-BPC for patients, health systems, and society.
Closing these gaps in knowledge will support wider adoption of ci-BPC by providing a framework for
implementation and evaluation. My central hypothesis is that ci-BPC counselling increases patient
breastfeeding knowledge and social support, leading to increased empowerment and reduced stress, and that
the improvements in breastfeeding rates conferred by ci-BPC will be associated with lower cost of healthcare
utilization for infants in the first 6 months post-delivery. Specifically, I aim: (1) To determine the essential
program activities of an effective hospital ci-BPC program, identify relevant contextual factors, and adapt the
program to optimize breastfeeding outcomes for Black and Latinx patients; (2) To determine whether the
adapted ci-BPC program is more effective at improving breastfeeding outcomes, attitude, knowledge, and
support compared to standard prenatal care, and (3) To determine patient, program, healthcare, and societal
costs for ci-BPC. This project will evaluate an innovative hospital-based ci-BPC program at NorthShore
University HealthSystem that has demonstrated significant reduction in breastfeeding disparities. My intimate
role with this ci-BPC program and my expertise in mixed-methods field-based and clinical research has
equipped me with the skills to undertake such a project, but I need additional mentorship and training in
implementation science, clinical intervention research, and healthcare economics. The training and research
are significant because disparities in maternal and child health in the US are growing, and an evidence-basis
is essential to replicate and scale up interventions that promote health equity. This innovative research will
generate novel data regarding ci-BPC program design and economic impact of ci-BPC that will inform broader
implementation of this intervention. This application is responsive to SEN NOT-HS-21-014: AHRQ Announces
Interest in Health Services Research to Advance Health Equity."
10849793,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic, debilitating disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with
peak onset in adolescence and early adulthood. More than 3 million people are affected in U.S., with an
estimated direct healthcare cost of $6.3 billion per year. IBD are highly heritable, thus, studying the genetic basis
of IBD is a natural path towards elucidating the IBD pathogenesis, which is poorly understood at present.
 Genome-wide association studies have identified over 240 loci associated with IBD. These associations
typically implicate large genomic regions with hundreds of variants due to the linkage disequilibrium (LD). The
latest IBD fine-mapping study resolved the LD and mapped 45 IBD associations to single-variant resolution,
providing insights into how genetic variants contribute to IBD pathogenesis in a tissue specific manner. Despite
of this initial success, most IBD associations and putative causal variants to date were derived from European
ancestries with uncertainty in their transferability to non-European ancestries; and the functional impact for most
IBD causal variants, especially the noncoding variants, is unclear.
 This proposed study bridges these gaps through an integrative strategy combining fine-mapping on a
large-scale multi-ancestry IBD cohort and well-designed functional experiments to investigate the genetic basis
of IBD. This cohort includes subjects of four ancestral populations including African, admixed American, East
Asian and European, with an unprecedented sample size of over 192,600 IBD cases, 3x, 12x, 5x and 3x of the
current IBD sample size for each ancestry respectively. A large amount of exome sequencing (WES) data will
be included, allowing us to investigate the contribution from rare coding variants which have been shown to be
important to IBD and help to link noncoding variants to their gene targets. Extensive quality control and
harmonization will be performed to generate a high quality, high coverage individual-level dataset with minimal
heterogeneity across ancestries, technologies, and batches. A novel fine-mapping method will be developed to
leverage the genomic diversity across ancestries and the WES data with the goal to enhance the fine-mapping
resolution especially in the coding genome. Over 200 new IBD causal variants are expected from this study,
including many that have large effects and directly disrupt protein functions. These variants will be characterized
for their molecular and cellular mechanism in IBD in human T cells using pooled CRISPR activation and CRISPR
interference experiments, and knockins of coding variants for their effects on gene regulation in resting and
stimulated cells.
 The new IBD causal variants and biology from this study will provide new insights into IBD pathogenesis,
make important positive impact and serve as the fundamental resource and basis toward novel IBD therapeutics."
10849878,"Insufficient functional β-cell mass can cause type 2 diabetes (T2D). This application will elucidate how the DNA methylomes in embryonic multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells (mPPCs) pre-determine this mass. During embryogenesis, mPPCs activate pro-endocrine transcription factor (TF) Ngn3 to give rise to endocrine progenitor cells (EPCs), from which β cells are derived. DNA methylation is a relatively stable repressive mark that is laid down by several enzymes including DNA methyl-transferase 1 (Dnmt1). DNMT1 polymorphisms are associated with attenuated β-cell function and human T2D. We show that fetal exposure to maternal low-protein diet, known to compromise functional β-cell mass, enhances Dnmt1 expression in mouse mPPCs. We recently published that both mPPC and EPC pools can be split into subsets that carry different DNA methylation levels at likely instructive gene enhancers, which can bias islet-cell fate choice. Moreover, higher Dnmt1 expression in mPPCs/EPCs favors β-cell differentiation; yet EPC differentiation toward islet cells involves a rapid and substantial downregulation of Dnmt1 and concordant de-methylation in putative enhancers of genes that regulate β-cell proliferation and function (referred to as fitness). The latter includes Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), a gene that promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our model is that the methylomes in mPPCs can influence the evolving methylomes in their descendant EPCs and β cells. Thus, mPPCs with distinct methylomes can give rise to β-cell subsets with different fitness by pre-setting the expression levels of genes that will be activated later for high β-cell fitness qualities. Perturbing the early-stage methylomes, by changed Dnmt1 expression and/or maternal diet manipulation, will shift the portions of β-cell subsets and consequently the functional β-cell mass and the susceptibility to T2D. Consistent with this model, we showed that a portion (~55%) of β cells derived from a subset of Ngn3+ EPCs that co-express TF Myt1 (i.e., Myt1+Ngn3+ or “M+N+”) has higher postnatal fitness than those from M-N+ cells under normal physiology. Here, we will first define the fitness of M+N+ or M-N+ progenitor-derived β-cell subsets under metabolic stresses such as aging, hyperglycemia, or insulin resistance to elucidate their physiological significance (Am 1). We will then examine the transcriptomes/methylomes of the two subsets to define the key methylated loci that can account for their distinct β-cell fitness, including testing if the differential Syt7 expression in the two β-cell subsets (observed by us) contributes to their different insulin secretion activities (Aim 2). Lastly, we will examine how maternal low-protein diet exposure impacts the derivation and fitness of M+N+ and M-N+ progenitor-derived β-cell subsets, focusing on the roles of enhanced Dnmt1 expression in mPPCs (Aim 3). We expect to impact the field by establishing direct mechanistic links between maternal factors and genetic networks that regulate functional β-cell mass and susceptibility to T2D. Our innovative combinatorial lineage marking of β-cell subsets put us in a unique position to study these issues."
10849920,"SUMMARY
Bone fragility and joint disease present major challenges to the skeletal and dental health of the aging population.
However, both conditions face a serious treatment gap. For example, therapies for bone fragility treat low bone
mass, but overlook approximately 50% of fractures that result from impaired bone quality. Therapies to prevent
or reverse joint degeneration remain elusive. The long-term goal of this research is to overcome this treatment
gap by elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that maintain bone quality and joint homeostasis.
Ongoing efforts highlight the critical role of osteocytes in both processes, as well as their contribution to bone
fragility and joint disease. Osteocytes play a fundamental role in skeletal homeostasis and disease through the
process of perilacunar canalicular remodeling (PLR). In PLR, osteocytes secrete acid and proteases to
dynamically resorb, and then replace, the surrounding bone matrix. PLR maintains the canalicular network and
bone matrix material properties, a major aspect of bone quality. Indeed, osteocyte-intrinsic disruption of TGFβ
signaling in TβRIIocy-/- mice results in a 65% decline in femoral work to fracture, even with normal cortical bone
mass. Preliminary and newly published data document profound PLR suppression in human osteoarthritis, and
provide evidence that PLR defects play a causal role in joint degeneration in both TβRIIocy-/- mice and in mice
with osteocyte-intrinsic ablation of the PLR enzyme MMP13 (MMP13ocy-/-). Furthermore, PLR is suppressed in
aging bone in much the same manner as in both mouse models. Although these findings suggest a role for
TGFβ, MMP13, and PLR in the age-related decline in bone quality and joint health, the mechanisms responsible
for PLR suppression in aging, or by which PLR suppression contributes to skeletal disease are mostly unknown.
RNAseq of TβRIIocy-/-, MMP13ocy-/-, and aging bone reveals evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in each model,
a possibility that will be further explored in this project. A computational approach will be used to integrate
genome-wide mouse RNAseq and human GWAS data to improve the identification of novel, clinically-relevant
genes involved in bone fragility and osteoarthritis. These results will prioritize mechanistic gain and loss of
function studies to test the hypothesis that TGFβ-dependent PLR suppression and osteocyte mitochondrial
dysfunction play a causal role in the age-related decline in bone quality and joint health. The proposal pursues
three specific aims: 1) to determine the role of TGFβ and PLR in age-dependent loss of bone quality and joint
homeostasis, 2) to identify PLR-dependent mechanisms implicated in human bone fragility and joint disease,
and 3) to identify mechanisms by which PLR and mitochondrial function are deregulated in aging. These studies
will reveal if PLR suppression in aging represents a common cellular mechanism that drives the temporal decline
of bone quality and joint health, and further, if the unique metabolic control of osteocytes creates opportunities
to specifically target this cell population to improve skeletal and dental health in aging."
10847004,"ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION)
The rapid advancement of novel biomedical technologies to inform the human condition in conjunction with the
explosion of resultant data continues to significantly alter the landscape of research and patient care. New ways
to measure and contextualize physiologic processes – from mobile health (mHealth) through to newer imaging
methods – are transforming our understanding of health and disease. Such techniques now shape our under-
standing of an individual within everyday activities and over time; and when integrated with more conventional
(clinical) assessments, enhance how we approach personalized healthcare delivery. Yet the complexity of these
analyses, especially with emergent types of data, requires a special skillset for which there remains a deficiency
within our biomedical workforce. We need researchers who will continue to be at the forefront of these technol-
ogies and analyses to enable the development and translation of such methods into effective practice.
The UCLA Medical & Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to lead the training of the next generation
of such scientists who will develop the needed computational approaches and applications that enable this fu-
ture. We have coalesced leading experts in different sensing/imaging methods (e.g., from bioengineering, radi-
ology), artificial intelligence (computer science, biomedical informatics), (bio)statistics, medicine, and other ar-
eas. This group actively collaborates to foster interdisciplinary teaching and mentoring of students. Building on
our success of our past decade, we have evolved this training program to promote innovative research through-
out the spectrum of biomedical informatics and data science at the intersection of sensing/imaging and data-
driven analyses, along with an appreciation of team science and pragmatic translational issues via implementa-
tion science. While we continue to focus on imaging across multiple clinical domains (e.g., radiology, pathology,
ophthalmology, etc.), we further embrace new types of sensing and imaging at the cutting-edge of development.
Learning from our past efforts, in this renewal this T32’s training program now involves a streamlined 1-year core
curriculum introducing foundational methods of the discipline, forming a breadth of understanding while reinforc-
ing the technical proficiencies needed by any future scientist working across myriad types of data (e.g., signal,
imaging, clinical, omics). Subsequently, our students specialize via more advanced elective coursework custom-
ized to their research interests. Trainees are challenged to propose, develop, and test new data-driven methods
that will advance the discipline, as well as ultimately change and affect healthcare by tackling real-world prob-
lems. Acknowledging the ongoing shift in career focus from many trainees, our T32 includes several professional
development activities to facilitate a range of research-oriented careers. Through the experiences gained during
this T32 training program, students in this T32 will become independent scientists, prepared to contribute to and
lead medical and imaging informatics as it continues to grow."
10847260,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of the study is to uncover how human somatic cells regulate proper chromosome
organization during development. While pairing of homologous chromosomes can drive meiotic recombination,
mitotic pairing can lead to detrimental consequences such as allelic mis-regulation and genome instability in
humans. However, it remains largely unknown how mitotic pairing and recombination, is prevented in somatic
cells to avoid genomic instability during continuous cellular division in development.
We have recently revealed that: (a) Dividing human primary cells keep two haploid chromosome sets apart to
either side of the centrosome, or nuclear division axis; (b) A diminished zone, devoid of interchromosomal
linkage components, is present along the centrosome axis, forming the boundary between the two haploid
sets; (c) Simultaneous tracking of individual chromosome oscillation and the spindle axis, demonstrates
ipsilateral restriction of chromosome movement of two chromosome sets from mitosis onset to G1 interphase;
(d) High resolution imaging of a translocation mouse with a supernumerary chromosome reveals that a
maternally derived chromosome is positioned to a haploid set based on parental origin; and (e) This haploid
set-based anti-pairing motif is lost in renal carcinoma cells.
These findings reveal a new model wherein somatic cells impede homologous chromosome pairing by keeping
two haploid chromosome sets apart along a diminished zone of interchromosomal linkage components,
coincident with the centrosome axis. The model predicts that compartmentalization of the individual haploid
sets from each other require biophysical inter-chromosomal linkage properties within a haploid set, along with
an association between the two haploid sets. Anti-pairing of homologous chromosomes is essential for genetic
stability and function in human cells, thus, we predict that the spatial segregation of haploid sets is conserved
among all cell types. Our proposal aims to experimentally test these hypotheses. Successful outcomes of this
comprehensive study will generate new mechanistic information for how anti-pairing of homologs is achieved,
maintained, and regulated throughout the cell cycle. These results would allow us investigate the significance
of higher-order chromosome organization in cellular development that will be critically important for elucidating
new mechanisms of human disease."

The USC Multidisciplinary Research Training Program in Gerontology provides predoctoral and postdoctoral
training using a multidisciplinary approach that considers aging from all levels, including cellular, brain
systems, psychology, society, economics, and policy. Trainees become expert in one aspect of aging while
also learning about the theory and methodological approaches of related disciplines so they can incorporate
multidisciplinary thinking and models in their own research. Predoctoral training can be in Biology,
Gerontology, Psychology, Neuroscience, Policy, and Medicine. Postdoctoral students can be appointed in
these fields as well as Economics, Neurology, and several multidisciplinary research institutes. The
overarching goal of the program is to develop future leaders in the field who use multidisciplinary approaches
to investigate factors determining physical and cognitive health in aging. We have three main foci: 1) How the
exposome influences aging; 2) Using geroscience approaches to understand population aging; and 3)
Understanding factors that affect the brain and cognition during aging. USC is at the cutting edge of research
in each of these areas. The training program is housed in the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology which is
devoted to the study of aging. Training is directed by a multidisciplinary faculty across the University who are
linked in many ways because of their focus on aging research. The environment is rich with resources and
research opportunities. Training is accomplished through completion of (1) disciplinary degree requirements for
the Ph.D.; (2) participation in multidisciplinary courses on health and aging and research on Alzheimer’s
disease; (3) training in appropriate methods and analytic techniques; (4) research experience within and
across disciplines; (5) close mentoring relationships between trainees and one or more preceptors; (6)
participation of trainees in training experiences such as courses, workshops, and professional meetings; and
(7) support of trainees to develop individual research profiles, publish papers, and make presentations at
professional meetings. The program goal is to develop scholars with independent research careers who
become leading scholars in the science of aging. The program draws from a large pool of talented students.
Almost all students who enter the program complete it successfully and the program has produced a number of
leaders and emerging leaders in aging related research, a number of whom are diverse scholars. Support is
requested for 5 predoctoral trainees, who will generally be supported for 3 years, and 5 postdoctoral trainees,
who will generally be supported for 2 years."
10848013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Recent FDA accelerated approvals of two anti-amyloid antibody treatments, aducanumab and lecanemab, for
early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provide the first disease-modifying treatments to date, albeit with modest-
to-moderate slowing of cognitive decline, and potentially fatal vascular side effects known as Amyloid Related
Imaging Abnormalities due to edema (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in a subset of patients, especially
ApoE4 carriers. A recent press release reported efficacy and ARIA in a Phase 3 trial of donanemab, another
antibody targeting aggregated amyloid- (A) protein. ARIA is mostly asymptomatic and transient but
occasionally causes more severe cortical edema and hemorrhage, which makes understanding and mitigating
ARIA an urgent unmet need as these antibodies move into the clinic. Strong but circumstantial evidence points
to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Aβ deposits within the brain vasculature, rather than amyloid plaques, as
a cause of ARIA. Patients with CAA in addition to amyloid plaques are at higher risk of ARIA than patients with
plaques but no CAA. Patients carrying an APOE ε4 allele, which predisposes to CAA and impairs Aβ clearance
across the blood-brain barrier, are also at higher risk than patients with ε3 or ε2 alleles. We hypothesize that
infused anti-amyloid antibodies first encounter and bind vascular amyloid and cause ARIA. Testing this
hypothesis requires determining if antibodies that cause more ARIA (e.g., aducanemab) bind more vascular A,
localize earlier and at higher concentrations to vascular A, and cause more immune activation toward vascular
A than antibodies that cause less ARIA (e.g., lecanemab). APOE is likely to play a role as an anti-APOE
antibody, HAE-4, has been reported to clear both vascular and plaque amyloid while restoring vascular function
(Xiong et al., 2021). Complement fixation of the anti-A antibodies at sites of vascular amyloid may lead to
activation of the complement cascade that results in a proinflammatory response, BBB leakage, edema and
microhemorrhage. Therefore, we hypothesize that combining anti-amyloid antibodies with antibodies targeting
poorly lipidated APOE associated with fibrillar amyloid or complement C1s to block complement activation will
mitigate ARIA and perhaps improve efficacy. We propose the following three Aims: 1. We will compare four
anti-amyloid antibodies (aducanemab, lecanemab, gantenerumab and donanemab) for their binding to plaque
vs. vascular amyloid both biochemically and pathologically. 2. We will define the timing of ARIA and characterize
vascular changes after 2, 4 and 8 weekly treatments with recombinant murine aducanemab, lecanemab and
donanemab in aged 5XE4 mice. 3. We will combine the anti-amyloid antibody most prone to induce ARIA in
Aim 2 with the HAE-4 anti-APOE antibody or an anti-C1s antibody to block the activation of the classical
complement pathway to mitigate ARIA in aged 5XE4 mice. If successful, we will have a mechanism for anti-
amyloid immunotherapy-related ARIA. Combination trials targeting amyloid and APOE or C1s in humans could
be initiated to improve the efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid antibody immunotherapy."

10859386,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a crucial immunosuppressive medication that prevents kidney transplant rejection
and prolongs the survival of the transplanted organ. MPA, however, is associated with dose-limiting side effects
of diarrhea and leukopenia. Recent animal studies have shown that MPA-related toxicities are dependent on the
gut microbiota, but our understanding of MPA reactivation in the gut and its contribution to associated toxicities
is incomplete. Understanding the impact of gut-mediated MPA reactivation is critical because transplant
physicians frequently encounter MPA-associated toxicities in clinical practice. Transplant physicians routinely
decrease the dosage of MPA during episodes of post-transplant diarrhea and leukopenia, but large studies have
shown that such actions are associated with acute organ rejection. Thus, it is imperative that we define the roles
played by gut bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes in MPA reactivation, enterohepatic recirculation, and
associated toxicities.
The overall goals of this proposal are to identify the microbial GUS enzymes involved in reactivation of
MPA and to define the relationship between fecal GUS activity, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and
MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients. We hypothesize that specific microbial GUS
enzymes drive the reactivation and enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and that quantitative fecal GUS enzyme
assays will serve as a biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities. Here we will study a cohort of 210 kidney
transplant recipients with and without MPA-associated toxicities. Our center at Weill Cornell routinely performs
approximately 250 kidney transplant recipients per year, supporting the feasibility of recruiting this number of
patients that will sufficiently power the study to successfully test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define the gut
microbial GUS enzymes that reactivate MPA and the drugs that may disrupt them. In Aim 2, we will define the
relationship among quantitative fecal GUS activities, MPA enterohepatic recirculation, and MPA-associated
toxicities.
This project will reveal fundamental data about the gut microbiota's ability to reactivate MPA, influence
enterohepatic recirculation, and impact therapeutic tolerance. Importantly, it will assess fecal GUS enzyme
activity as a novel biomarker for MPA-associated toxicities, allowing for the development of more personalized
approaches to optimize MPA efficacy and minimize MPA-associated toxicities in kidney transplant recipients."

Poor oral health during pregnancy may have long term implications for the oral and overall health of expectant
mothers and their children. For example, children of mothers with high levels of tooth decay have three times
the odds of developing caries before their sixth birthday. Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease of
childhood and particularly acute for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic children who experience more than twice
the rate of untreated decay compared with non-Hispanic white children. While pregnancy increases a person’s
susceptibility to oral health problems, pregnant people are less likely to visit the dentist (44%) than
reproductive-aged people who are not pregnant (65%). The objective of this application is to use quasi-
experimental methods to estimate the effects of Medicaid pregnancy dental benefits on dental care use among
pregnant people and subsequent outcomes among their children and to evaluate whether these policies have
the potential to promote health equity. Our central hypothesis is that pregnancy dental benefits will increase the
use of all service types among pregnant people and increase preventive care but reduce the need for
restorative treatment among young children by delaying or preventing the onset of dental caries. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to examine the effects of Medicaid pregnancy
dental benefits on reported dental visits and claims-based measures of the use of preventive and restorative
dental services among pregnant people; 2) to examine the effects of Medicaid pregnancy dental benefits on
later dental care use among children ages 2-11 who were exposed to the policy while in utero, including
reported dental visits, claims-based measures of the use of preventive and restorative dental services, out-of-
pocket spending on dental care, and unmet needs for dental care due to cost; and 3) to evaluate the effects of
Medicaid pregnancy dental benefits by race and ethnicity and by county-level measures of access barriers and
facilitators including dentist supply, federally-qualified community health center supply and investment,
immigration enforcement, and measures of Black-white disparities in income, education, housing, and the labor
market. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will be among the first to examine
how children’s exposure to Medicaid dental benefits while in utero affects their later dental care utilization, it
will link mothers and their children in a subset of our analyses, and we will apply newly developed methods to
address variation in the timing of state policy changes. The proposed research is significant because pregnant
people and children underutilize recommended dental services, untreated dental caries among children may
interfere with their development, and there are persistent disparities in dental visit rates and oral health by race
and ethnicity. The public health impact of this research will be to provide critical new evidence on whether
pregnancy dental benefits have long-lasting impacts on children who were exposed to the policies while in
utero and to assist policymakers in assessing the full scope of the benefits and costs of these policies."

 Lipids make up half of the brain’s weight and are required for the proper development, structure, and
function of healthy brains. As we age, the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases increases.
This proposal seeks to understand whether aging changes the lipid composition of the brain and whether these
changes contribute to aging and/or predispose us to disease. Unfortunately, the field currently lacks a deep
understanding of lipid composition and dynamics in the aging brain, preventing progress toward this larger goal.
Using a unique approach to lipidomics that integrates chemistry to examine the brain lipidome of aging mice led
to the discovery of the unannotated 3-sulfo galactosyl diacylglycerol (SGDG) lipids as the most significantly
decreased lipids in the aging brain. Furthermore, SGDGs are a novel class of anti-inflammatory lipids, suggesting
that decreased SGDG levels with aging may promote brain inflammation.
 The discovery of SGDGs as age-regulated lipids represent a new frontier at the interface of aging
research and lipid biology. This proposal seeks to answer the most pressing questions about SGDGs and their
role in aging and disease. Specifically, this proposal asks how SGDG levels are controlled during aging and
neurodegenerative disease (Aim 1); determine whether SGDGs are bioactive in vivo and whether they reverse
inflammation or any other age- or disease-associated phenotypes (Aim 2); and measure SGDG distribution in
the brain and myelin of mouse models of aging and neurogenerative disease (Aim 3). To accomplish these goals,
the approach relies heavily on chemistry to synthesize of SGDGs and SGDG analogs and use these unique
reagents for cell biology, in vivo pharmacology and biology, proteomics, genomics, and imaging methods to
elucidate SGDG’s role in aging and neurodegenerative disease.
 These studies will explain how age-related differences in lipids and lipid metabolism can contribute to
aging and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, since SGDGs are also found in human and primate brains,
this information may contribute to the longer-term goal of knowing which age-regulated changes in lipids and
lipid metabolism predispose humans to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration."

The Johns Hopkins Translational ImmunoEngineering NCBIB, JH-TIE, is a multidisciplinary P41 program
focused on the development of tools, methods, and education for the advancement of immunoengineering.
Moving forward into the next five years under a renewed grant, our efforts will span a synergistic multiscale
approach, from the molecular and cellular levels to tissues, organs, and systems, driven by collaborations with
the scientific and clinical communities. JH-TIE’s vision is to control the powerful, yet sometimes competing,
outcomes of immunity by developing advanced technologies to engineer, direct, and ultimately control immune
responses. In the initial funding period, despite pandemic-related shutdowns, we successfully established work
flows between the TR&Ds and CPs/SPs, leading to a total of 54 publications, 18 of which were collaborative
(between TR&Ds or between TR&Ds and CPs/SPs), and nine additional collaborative grants. Over the next five
years, we will develop tools, techniques, and protocols that are broadly relevant to immune and inflammatory
diseases, such as autoimmunity, infectious disease, and cancer. TR&D 1 focuses on activation mechanisms –
the development of platforms that efficiently activate T cells and potentiate antigen-specific effector T cells for
immunotherapy. TR&D 2 extends its strong foundation in antigen delivery with the design of nanoscale packages
to safely convey immunological cargos to precise cellular targets. TR&D 3 realizes a new opportunity to engineer
immune responses on the protein level via signaling cue modulation – an evolution that moves away from indirect
immune control (leveraging the metabolic profile of the cell that characterized the previous version of this TR&D)
to more direct control of specific cytokine interactions. Collectively, the three TR&Ds will generate tools to
exquisitely and selectively control immune outcomes against heretofore intractable targets at the cellular,
subcellular, and molecular levels. Additionally, these innovations may open new avenues to utilizing potent
immune effectors in novel ways – maximizing our understanding of and ability to engineer immune responses.
The broad applicability of these tools, techniques, and protocols will be demonstrated in models of autoimmune
disease, tumor immunotherapy, and infectious disease. JH-TIE will integrate diverse disciplines, with distinct
tools, methods, and expertise, to address a wide range of clinical applications. Our investigators come from
Departments of Pathology, Oncology, Dermatology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and
Materials Science and Engineering. Our diverse interests extend to a relationship with another P41, the
Resource for Molecular Imaging Agents in Precision Medicine (Martin Pomper, PI). Adding in the 15
Collaborative Projects and 11 Service Projects, JH-TIE serves as a hub and a broad research interface, providing
training for scientists, students, policy makers, and the general public through our education and outreach
program, and accelerating the translation of immunoengineering and cellular therapies."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and the most common age-related
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degradation of neurons, inflammation, decline in
memory and behavior, and the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque in the brain, particularly in the
hippocampus and cortex. The roles of microglia in AD are still a matter of intense debate in this disease. Using
the 5xFAD double transgenic mouse model of AD, which expresses mutant human APP and PSEN1, we
demonstrated that single systemic WT HSPC transplantation fully rescued AD leading to the preservation of
memory and neurocognitive performance, reduction of the β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque burden in hippocampus and
cortex, prevention of microgliosis and neuroinflammation, and preservation of the blood brain barrier (BBB)
integrity. We also showed that HSPCs differentiated into microglia-like cells in the brain, replacing up to 40% of
the endogenous microglia in the brain and with a resting and ramified phenotype. In contrast, transplanting
5xFAD mice with 5xFAD HPSCs had limited to no impact on any complications of AD. This work opens new
perspectives for utilizing HSPCs for the treatment of AD. However, the exact mechanism underlying the
significant therapeutic impact observed after transplanting WT HPSCs in the 5xFAD mice remains unclear.
Indeed, WT HSPC transplant fully prevented microgliosis, neuroinflammation and BBB disruption, despite partial
replacement of microglia by HSPC-derived microglia-like cells, suggesting a systemic beneficial impact of WT
HSPCs. In contrast, HSPCs isolated from 5xFAD mice exhibit limited to no therapeutic effect, suggesting that
5xFAD HSPCs and/or their progeny carry an inflammatory phenotype. This was supported by our preliminary
data showing significant decreases in memory and increases in locomotor activity in WT mice transplanted with
5xFAD HSPCs, resembling the behavioral patterns observed in 5xFAD mice. We will investigate the mechanisms
behind the impact of HSPCs, by first assessing the impact of 5xFAD HSPCs on the microgliosis and
neuroinflammation in WT mice and by examining the hematopoietic lineage profile in the peripheral blood to
verify if any skewing towards a specific lineage exists in the mice receiving the 5xFAD HSPCs. We will also
identify the genetic susceptibility that may exist in 5xFAD HSPCs or their hematopoietic progeny using RNAseq
and ATACseq. In addition, we will test the potential effects of mutated APP and/or PSEN1 on hematopoietic cell
lineages and determine whether they could directly trigger a pro-inflammatory state using CRISPR/Cas9
technology to knockout hmAPP and hmPSEN1 in murine Sca1+ HSPCs. Finally, we will determine the ability of
WT HSPCs to reverse neuroinflammation and preexisting complications in AD despite the presence of Aβ
aggregates by transplanting older 5xFAD mice (6 months of age) with WT HSPCs. This work should shed light
on the underlying mechanisms of AD rescue by HSPCs, advance the understanding the pathogenesis of AD,
and evaluate the potential of HSPC-based therapy for the treatment of this disease."

Amyloid β (Aβ) is a believed key toxic agent of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). To develop AD therapeutics, an
improved understanding of the mechanisms of Aβ toxicity is urgently needed. In the brain, Aβ is found mostly
in extracellular deposits that may be taken up by neurons. The purpose of this proposal is to test the central
hypothesis that neuronal Aβ uptake and toxicity are linked.
Aβ forms diverse aggregates with varied neurotoxic profiles. Little is known about how structure and aggrega-
tion state affect neuronal uptake and toxicity of Aβ. This makes it very difficult to devise strategies to block
these pathogenic processes. Efforts to determine how conformation and aggregation state of Aβ affects its’
neuronal uptake and toxicity were hampered thus far by the lack of (a) methods to produce stable samples for
structural analysis and (b) accurate tools to quantify neuronal uptake of different Aβ aggregates. Recent
chirality-based approaches of the Raskatov lab have produced a set of stabilized oligomeric and fibrillary Aβ
forms that will be used here as tools, with the goal to close this important knowledge gap. Proposed research
is cross-disciplinary and collaborative: it includes structural collaborations with Dr. Eisenberg and Dr. Tycko;
Dr. Glabe will consult on neurobiology experiments done in the Raskatov lab.
The purpose of Aim 1 is to complete the structural elucidation of racemic Aβ fibrils by ssNMR, to then use
those structural insights to devise smaller, more drug-like, oligomer-to-fibril converters, and to test the working
hypothesis that oligomer-to-fibril conversion reduces Aβ uptake into neurons, thus suppressing its toxicity. This
will be accomplished using C14-based radioquantitation tools in combination with various cell culture assays to
measure both rapid and slow toxic actions of Aβ against neurons. Aim 2 will test the working hypothesis that
the differences in toxicity between Aβ42-E22e and Aβ42-S26s are due to differences in their neuronal uptake,
and will also test the alternative hypothesis that the peptides traffic to different sub-cellular sites, and that the
differences in peptide toxicity are due to that. CryoEM structures of Aβ42-E22e and Aβ42-S26s stabilized
oligomers will be sought, to identify the structural motifs responsible for their toxicity differences. Aim 3 will test
the working hypothesis that the highly aggregation-prone, N-terminally truncated Aβ-related peptide p3
promotes oligomer-to-fibril conversion in Aβ, thus reducing Aβ uptake efficiency and making it less neurotoxic.
Successful completion will yield a quantitative link between neuronal uptake and toxicity of different Aβ forms.
It may yield the world’s first Aβ oligomer structures, as well as a structure of non-toxic Aβ fibrils. It may yield
smaller, D-peptidic Aβ oligomer-to-fibril converters to be translated to novel AD therapeutics in the future, and
it will also reveal how Aβ toxicity is suppressed by p3 addition. Finally, the proposed studies may uncover
general structural insights on how protein aggregation affects neuronal uptake and toxicity."
10837884,"Professional phagocytes undergo shifts in cell shape in response to a variety of cues, and this plasticity requires
the ability to remodel the cytoskeleton in extreme ways. Historically, many new insights into cell biology have
emerged from studying intracellular pathogens that have evolved to survive by modulating the subcellular
organization and function of host pathways. The goal of this proposal is to better understand how mycobacteria
manipulate the host cytoskeleton and the role of the WASH complex, an Arp2/3 nucleation promoting factor, in
this process. We have discovered an ancient mycobacterial effector, EsxM, that promotes changes to the
macrophage cytoskeleton through a putative interaction with WASHC4, a member of the WASH complex. These
changes enhance the dissemination of mycobacterial disease via migrating macrophages. The striking shift in
macrophage morphology and behavior induced by EsxM have led us to probe the extent of actin rearrangements
during infection (Aim 1) and whether the WASH complex may have unknown roles in regulating cell shape and
motility (Aim 2). Although the importance of cytoskeletal rearrangement in migrating cells is established, little is
known about how mycobacterial effectors may manipulate this axis during infection. Additionally, the WASH
complex has been studied primarily for its role in endocytic trafficking, but less is known about its potential role
in macrophage migration, or as a target of intracellular bacteria. Thus, new investigations into the host
cytoskeleton and the WASH complex are needed to understand their roles in cell migration and immunity. The
overall hypothesis of this proposal is that mycobacterial effector EsxM induces changes in the actin
cytoskeleton that lead to enhanced migratory capacity of macrophages via the WASH complex. In order
to test this hypothesis, I will first take advantage of our established zebrafish model which offers genetic
tractability and optical transparency. In Aim 1, I will utilize an established macrophage F-actin reporter zebrafish
line to observe changes in the actin cytoskeleton induced by EsxM in the context of cell migration and innate
immunity. I will combine high resolution imaging, pharmacological treatment, and genetic tools to functionally
test modes of macrophage migration during these processes. In Aim 2 I will test how genetic disruption of the
WASH complex changes macrophage morphology and migration in vivo using zebrafish knockouts. I will also
take advantage of a mouse line in which the WASH complex is disrupted to study its role in mycobacterial
infection in a mammalian model. Overall, these studies will both take advantage of the zebrafish system to
provide insights into the dynamic actin cytoskeleton in real time, and interrogate a role for the WASH complex in
macrophage migration. The completion of the proposed work will represent a significant advancement in our
understanding of how the actin cytoskeleton is altered in the context of infection, and how the WASH complex
regulates macrophage biology beyond endocytic trafficking alone. The findings will highlight the importance of
studying host-pathogen interactions to elucidate the function of host-factors during infection and homeostasis."
10860064,"10 Project Summary/Abstract
Kidney diseases are a leading cause of death in the United States. Ensuring successful transplants for patients
with end stage renal failure (ESRD) is a major priority of our nation, but a persistent shortage of deceased-donor
kidney donations and high organ discard rates limits access to deceased-donor kidney transplants. To identify
underlying causes of the non-utilization of transplant-quality kidneys, this study aims to investigate clinicians’
idiosyncratic decision-making when considering deceased-donor kidney transplant offers.
Our team’s preliminary research shows that individual doctors have different ways of deciding whether a kidney
is suitable for transplantation. To investigate this further, we have created a unique data set that combines
information about kidney offers with on-call records of doctors who evaluated these offers, to identify the individual
decision-makers evaluating each offer. This novel data linkage opens the door to an opportunity to measure offer
acceptance rates and examine acceptance patterns at the individual clinician level. By analyzing these data,
we discovered that even within the same medical center, where doctors have the same resources and patient
populations, doctors have widely varying acceptance thresholds for donor kidney offers.
The broader phase of our study has three aims. First, we aim to recruit new transplant centers to expand the
individual-level, potential transplant recipient (iPTR) dataset we have begun assembling with initially enrolled cen-
ters. The iPTR dataset will include clinician-level offer decisions, including refusal reasons for declined organs,
as well as medical characteristics of the donors and recipients for each offer. Second, we will elicit clinicians’ be-
liefs about ESRD patients’ quality-of-life while on maintenance dialysis compared to various post-transplantation
health states, as well as the likelihood of kidneys of varying quality leading to better or worse post-transplant
health. Third, we will identify differences in the influence of various clinical factors (e.g., donor age) and non-
clinical factors (e.g, beliefs) on offer decisions across clinicians.
This study investigates individual decision-making on real-world, deceased donor kidney offers for the first time.
By integrating survey data capturing clinicians’ subjective beliefs about ESRD and transplant patient outcomes,
we will better understand how behavioral factors impact the transplantation system alongside clinical factors. This
study has the potential to make a significant impact on the health of our population by providing novel insights to
guide the future development of targeted interventions that can lead to more successful kidney transplants and
improved length and quality of life for kidney disease patients."
10850823,"Project Summary
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a progressive optic neuropathy, causes irreversible blindness. There are
multiple risk factors for this disease, but the only modifiable attribute is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
Elevated IOP results from a blockage in the aqueous humor drainage pathway in the anterior eye. As pressure
builds, stress is exerted on the optic nerve head in the posterior segment, leading to optic nerve damage and a
slow and irreversible decline in vision. The trabecular meshwork (TM) is the tissue responsible for regulating IOP
homeostasis. In response to sustained elevated pressure, TM cells are stretched and they release enzymes to
focally degrade extracellular matrix (ECM), which allows greater aqueous outflow and lowers IOP. Glaucomatous
TM has excess amounts of disorganized ECM compared to age-matched tissue, suggesting that dysfunctional
ECM contributes to increased resistance to aqueous outflow. However, it is currently unknown which ECM
components cause dysfunction. In this application, we focus on one ECM protein called thrombospondin-1 (TSP-
1). We recently reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2228262, which causes a missense N700S
amino acid change in TSP-1, was significantly associated with elevated IOP in a large POAG family. Our
preliminary data show that the TSP-1 N700S variant is present in approximately 9.5% of normal and 38%
glaucomatous TM cell strains. Thus, we have a unique opportunity to study the function of the naturally occurring
N700S TSP-1 variant in a glaucoma-relevant tissue. We postulate that the N700S TSP-1 variant causes changes
in ECM organization and TM cell dysfunction, which contribute to development of fibrotic matrices characteristic
of the glaucomatous TM in situ. TSP-1 is a potent activator of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), which
stimulates ECM synthesis and plays major roles in glaucoma pathophysiology. Yet, there are no glaucoma
therapies directed at modulating TGFβ levels. In this application, we will investigate the molecular consequences
of the N700S variant in normal and glaucomatous TM cells, and use a peptide TSP-1 antagonist to target the
TSP-1-TGFβ pathway. Our overall hypothesis is that modifications to TSP-1 molecular function disrupt ECM
organization and TGFβ activity in the normal and glaucomatous TM. Three aims are proposed: (1) to analyze
ECM composition, ultrastructural organization and TSP-1 protein-protein interactions in wild-type and N700S
variant cell strains derived from normal and glaucomatous TM; (2) to measure the impact of the N700S variant
on phagocytosis, matrix metalloproteinase enzyme activity, and TGFβ activity using endogenous, over-
expressed and CRISPR-edited TM cells; and (3) to use a peptide antagonist, which competitively and specifically
blocks TGFβ activation by TSP-1, to investigate its effects on endogenous and CRISPR-edited N700S TM cells,
as well as to determine its effects on outflow rates in an ex vivo model of IOP regulation. Together, these results
will provide an in-depth analysis of the role of a glaucoma-associated TSP-1 gene variant in the TM and will
explore a novel therapeutic targeting the TSP-1-TGFβ pathway to reduce elevated IOP in glaucoma patients."
10850942,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac fibrosis is a common adverse myocardial remodeling event that worsens heart failure caused by chronic
ventricular pressure overload and other cardiac pathologies such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
Due to our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis, no specific antifibrotic therapy
exists, and affected patients are usually treated by heart transplantation, a therapy that has many limitations.
Motivated by this clinical problem, our research has recently uncovered new insights into the regulation of cardiac
collagen content and fibrosis, and, in this application, we propose to extend this work to gain further
understanding into cellular and molecular mechanisms. In our recent work, we discovered that global deficiency
of SLIT3, a secreted glycoprotein which binds to the ROBO receptors, leads to a marked decrease in cardiac
collagen content, improved diastolic function in adult mice, and decreased cardiac fibrosis and improved survival
after left ventricle (LV) pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). We also found that
SLIT3 stimulates cardiac fibroblast function, intracellular signaling, and collagen production in vitro. Collectively,
these results support a developmental link between SLIT3 and collagen deposition during both normal cardiac
homeostasis and pathologic stress. However, as these studies relied on SLIT3 global knockout mice where
SLIT3 knockout potentially affected developmental programs, the more specific, postnatal functions of SLIT3 -
as well as the details of the cellular and molecular signaling - remain undefined in the adult state. New preliminary
data using SLIT3 floxed mice and inducible Cre promoters, we find that SLIT3, generated by either cardiac
pericytes or fibroblasts, regulates collagen expression in vitro and in vivo in the postnatal state, most likely, by
signaling through ROBO1. Based on these results, our overarching hypothesis is that cardiac pericyte and
fibroblast-mediated SLIT3 regulate fibroblast activation and function via ROBO1 during conditions of
homeostasis and pressure overload. As such, we propose the following aims: (1) Characterize the role of SLIT3
in regulating adult cardiac fibroblast function in vivo. (2) Determine the details of how SLIT3/ROBO1 regulates
adult cardiac fibroblast activation and function in vivo and in vitro. (3) Characterize the role of cardiac pericyte
and fibroblast-mediated SLIT3 on the ROBO1-dependent response of cardiac fibroblasts during LV pressure
overload in vivo. This research will reveal new cellular and molecular concepts of cardiac fibroblast regulation
and will further advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis. The results of this research
may provide the rationale for targeting SLIT3-ROBO1 to mitigate pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis,
thereby benefiting patients with heart failure and other forms of cardiac disease."

computational methods and designs to estimate causal effects in behavioral health. To accomplish this goal,
we will provide rigorous training and high-quality mentorship in: 1) the science of behavioral health; 2)
computational and analytic tools to manage, analyze, and integrate complex data sources; and 3) causal
inference methods to take full advantage of these data. Trainees will receive interdisciplinary team-based
training and will acquire a deep understanding of all three areas. This training program will capitalize on the
rich resources for behavioral health, analytic and computational methods, and biostatistics at the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) and the broader University. The program will be housed
in the Department of Mental Health but the 5 trainees per year will come from any of the four social science
oriented departments at JHSPH: 1) Mental Health; 2) Health Behavior & Society; 3) Health Policy &
Management; and 4) Population Family & Reproductive Health. Further, the training grant will leverage close
connections with data scientists, statisticians, and computer scientists from across the University. Trainees will
obtain the skills and experiences needed to lead multi-disciplinary, collaborative research teams. Trainees will
undertake a rigorous program of coursework in the core domains of public health and behavioral health
including behavioral and social science, epidemiology, biostatistics, data science, population health
informatics, causal inference, and research ethics. In addition, each trainee will take additional elective courses
in social and behavioral perspectives on mental health and substance use, informatics and computational skills,
and causal and statistical inference. Trainees will participate in a year-long seminar on analytics for behavioral
health, a bi-weekly seminar to discuss research in progress and professional development, ongoing mentored
research projects, and integrative activities to complement their didactic curriculum. The focus area of the
program builds on strengths within JHSPH; these areas also are highlighted as priorities by OBSSR, NIMH,
and NIDA. The trainees will be supported by an experienced group of 21 core faculty and each trainee will be
co-advised by one of 9 affiliated faculty with methodological expertise. The training program director, Dr.
Elizabeth Stuart, is a national leader in analytic tools for behavioral health, and will be supported by a 4-
member internal Executive Committee and a 5-member external Advisory Committee. The overarching aim
of the program is to identify and train scholars who will become leaders in using a diversity of advanced

10850950,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors,
which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within
the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase
of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to
maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to
practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.
 Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper
limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the
effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic
stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback
mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.
 This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb
use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the
unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can
capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will
study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully
leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.
 To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of
body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke
survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful
information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of
our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to
deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered
design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth
system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.
 We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and
understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage
of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of
hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a syndrome that is particularly difficult to diagnose and
treat, yet, it is estimated to affect >50% of patients with HF. With >1 million hospitalizations for HF in the U.S.
annually and one-year mortality rates up to 29%, the health and economic impact of HFpEF is substantial. The
early detection of volume overload in the outpatient setting is critical to optimize decongestive therapy prior to
frank decompensation requiring hospitalization. Pulmonary congestion, a hallmark of volume overload in
HFpEF, plays a central role in the progression of decompensation ultimately leading to hospital admission.
However, current diagnostic methods for its detection are insensitive. Our central hypothesis is that the
assessment of pulmonary congestion by lung ultrasound (LUS) in HFpEF will outperform currently available
approaches. LUS is a novel, non-invasive and inexpensive tool in the quantification of pulmonary congestion.
With this study, we will expand our prior work to understand how this method could be utilized in an ambulatory
setting to identify pulmonary congestion in patients with known or suspected HFpEF. Our long-term goal is to
initiate early intervention, improve quality of life, and reduce HF hospitalizations and costs in this population.
Our specific aims are: 1) Determine the prevalence of lung ultrasound findings of pulmonary congestion and
their echocardiographic, biomarker and quality of life correlates in patients with HFpEF. 2A) Investigate the
prognostic value of lung ultrasound-detected pulmonary congestion for adverse HF events in ambulatory
patients with HFpEF. 2B) Develop and validate a congestion-focused risk score for ambulatory patients with
HFpEF integrating clinical, ultrasound and biomarker findings. Our approach is innovative by focusing on new
approaches to volume status assessment in a traditionally difficult to diagnose cohort of HFpEF patients, and
employing an inexpensive point-of-care device paired with a time-efficient, easily learned imaging protocol.
This proposal is significant because it will provide critically important information regarding the incremental
value of LUS for the detection of pulmonary congestion in ambulatory patients with HFpEF. It is therefore a
critical step toward improving the early detection of volume overload in patients at high risk for HF
hospitalizations and the associated morbidity, mortality and cost."
10851694,"The neural crest is a uniquely vertebrate cell type that is thought to have played an important
role in vertebrate evolution by forming peripheral ganglia and jaws, thus facilitating predation
and expansion of the brain. We recently identified a “cranial-specific” neural crest transcriptional
subcircuit in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) that imbues this neural crest population with the
unique ability, absent from trunk neural crest, to form craniofacial cartilage that is critical for jaw
formation. Here, we propose to examine whether homologous genes are expressed in the
cranial premigratory neural crest of lamprey, a jawless basal vertebrate (agnathan). Our
preliminary results suggest that many of these genes are “missing” from the lamprey's
premigratory cranial neural crest, thus challenging the hypothesis that invention of neural crest
in vertebrates gave rise to a “New Head”. Accordingly, we hypothesize that there was
progressive expansion of neural crest derivatives during the course of vertebrate evolution. This
likely occurred by addition of new enhancer elements into the premigratory neural crest that
conferred novel developmental potential onto this cell population. As case in point, lamprey lack
a vagal neural crest that in gnathostomes forms the enteric nervous system. To test this
hypothesis, we will perform lineage analysis, analyze transcription factors and regulatory
regions of selected genes across agnathan and gnathostomes. We will identify putative
enhancers, dissect their regulatory inputs, and test the ability of these regions to drive reporter
expression in lamprey as well as cross-species, in the zebrafish. The results promise to
elucidate how new cell types arose during vertebrate evolution under the umbrella of the neural
crest."
10838467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The high morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19 continues to underscore the importance of effective
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. While a few promising candidates have received EUAs, the emergence of more
transmissible variants which have impacted vaccine efficacy highlight the fact that several challenges remain. A
successful vaccine must: 1. induce robust long-lasting protection when natural infection with coronaviruses
generally leads to relatively short-lived immunity, 2. impart broad immunity as viral mutations accumulate, 3.
provide potent immunity in the elderly, and 4. be safe in light of enhanced disease observed with past coronavirus
vaccines. To address these challenges, this proposal aims to develop a safe, effective, and rapidly translatable
adjuvant system for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using a rationally designed combination adjuvant to target an array
of key innate receptor pathways involved in antiviral immunity. Adjuvants are powerful tools for promoting fast,
durable and qualitative responses most effective for a particular pathogen, especially in immune-challenged
individuals. Natural viral infection stimulates strong immune responses through activation of Toll-, RIG-I-, and
NOD-like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting
adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we will test the hypothesis that using
a combination of agonists that integrate these pathways will lead to improved humoral and cellular responses
towards SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this, we will combine a nanoemulsion-based adjuvant (NE) that activates
TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I (IVT DI). We have demonstrated that simultaneous activation of
TLRs, RIG-I, and NLRP3 with NE/IVT DI induces a synergistic immune response with magnified TH1-biased
cellular immunity. Guided by strong preliminary data demonstrating the effectiveness of this combined adjuvant
approach for improving influenza virus vaccination, and our initial studies with SARS-CoV-2 antigens, we will
develop this adjuvant for use in a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will profile the immune
responses elicited by NE/IVT DI with multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens through parenteral and mucosal routes to
optimize formulations and vaccination routes. In Aim 2, we will determine the protective efficacy and safety of
the optimized lead vaccine platforms in challenge models of SARS-CoV-2 and define key correlates of protection.
Increasing data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 elicits a weak innate response, with poor activation of critical antiviral
pathways, which likely contributes to the large variability in magnitude and durability of immune responses in
recovered patients. With this targeted approach, we expect to drive more robust and durable immunity while
avoiding immune responses promoting vaccine related pathology. The NE adjuvant and several RIG-I agonists
have demonstrated good safety profiles in phase I human trials. Thus, we expect that successful completion of
this work will lead to a rapidly translatable and deliverable adjuvant compatible with multiple SARS-CoV-2
vaccine candidates, and provide much needed insight on the key effectors of protective SARS-CoV-2 immunity."
10838469,"The mitochondrial ATP synthase is a multi-subunit complex that catalyzes the synthesis of >90% of ATP in
mammalian cells. The ATP synthase is also hypothesized to function as the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore (mPTP), a major trigger for necrotic cell death. Except for short-term drug inhibitor experiments, the
functions of the ATP synthase have never been assessed in the heart in vivo. We have created the first mouse
models deficient in the entire ATP synthase complex in cardiomyocytes. To accomplish this, we individually
deleted at 5 weeks of age ATP5L and ATP5J, ATP synthase subunits required for complex assembly. Thus far,
we have analyzed the ATP5L KO mice. Because the half-lives of most mitochondrial ATP synthase subunits
exceed 35 days in cardiomyocytes, the abundance of the complex decreased gradually with 15% remaining at
12 weeks post-deletion. KO mice uniformly developed heart failure (HF) with reduced systolic function and died
between 12-16 weeks post-deletion. Analysis of cardiac mitochondria confirmed reduced ATP synthesis rates
as expected. Unexpectedly, however, ATP concentrations in whole heart lysates, as well as in cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial fractions, were elevated in KO, compared with control, mice. Parallel investigations into the role of
the ATP synthase as the mPTP revealed that, rather than inhibiting Ca2+-induced mPTP opening, deficiency of
the ATP synthase sensitized this event. Moreover, mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deficiency of the ATP
synthase exhibited larger – not smaller – infarcts following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. Finally, we
observed that ATP synthase levels and activity in mitochondria decrease during pressure overload-induced HF
in wild type mice. These results suggest: (a) Loss of the mitochondrial ATP synthase activates marked
metabolic/energetic responses and unleashes previously unrecognized mechanisms that promote lethal HF.
Regarding the latter, our preliminary studies implicate Complex II to I reverse electron transport (RET) promoting
ROS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. (b) Our studies cast doubt that the ATP synthase also functions as the
mPTP and rather suggest that it is a negative regulator. (c) Deficient ATP synthase function may contribute to
acquired forms of HF. We propose studies to understand the mechanistic basis of our observations and to assess
the role deficient mitochondrial ATP synthase function in human HF. Aim 1. To define metabolic/energetic
pathways that are activated and mechanisms that contribute to HF in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deficiency
of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Aim 2. To test definitively whether the mitochondrial ATP synthase is the
mPTP. Aim 3. To assess the role of deficient mitochondrial ATP synthase abundance/function in pressure
overload-induced HF in mice and in human HF. These studies break new ground in investigating functions of
the mitochondrial ATP synthase in cardiomyocytes in vivo. Deliverables include the assessment of RET as a
novel HF mechanism, a definitive determination of the role of the ATP synthase as the mPTP, and a delineation
of the role deficient ATP synthase function in human HF."
10860172,"Project Summary. Greater than 20% of the active US workforce are shift workers who, because of their work
schedules, have disrupted eating patterns, sleep/wake cycles, and light exposure, resulting in circadian rhythm
disruption. Unfortunately, the only aspect that can be modified is the timing of dietary intake. Shift work-related
late night and erratic eating patterns increase the risk of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, and accelerate
disease progression and emergence of complications. Even a few years of shift work results in detrimental effects
on overall cardiometabolic health that persist long after the shift work ceases. Hence, shift workers bear a
disproportionately heavy burden in terms of obesity and cardiometabolic disorders. Exacerbating this problem is
the fact that the vast majority (>99.98%) of studies examining behavioral and pharmacological interventions
actively exclude shift workers. Major challenges to incorporating shift workers into clinical research are their
variable schedules and daytime sleeping habits, making frequent in-person study visits or group-based
interventions (such as diet and nutrition classes) impractical. To overcome this significant barrier to caring for
shift workers, an effective intervention should address and improve eating patterns through lifestyle interventions
that are pragmatic for real-world applications that can be applied remotely. This can be achieved by using
contemporary methods for effective patient education, engagement, monitoring, retention, and the promotion of
intervention adherence. The proposed clinical study makes innovative use of digital and mobile technologies to
study the effect of time-restricted eating (TRE) and TRE with a low-glycemic snack (TRE-LGS) during night shifts
as dietary interventions to improve the health of shift workers, specifically nurses and nursing assistants working
night shifts. TRE is a behavioral eating pattern intervention that combines the in-depth scientific knowledge of
the beneficial effects of fasting with the impact of meal timing on biological rhythms. A well-validated smartphone
app, myCircadianClock, has been used to monitor and facilitate a TRE eating pattern intervention in prior published
clinical trials and will be used in this study. Wearable sensors will be used for longitudinal and periodic
measurements of activity and sleep patterns, interstitial blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight. A
combination of live video consultation and digital educational materials will be used to guide participants through
the intervention. The proposed study will recruit overweight and obese adult night shift workers who will be
randomized into one of three arms: 1) standard of care (SOC) who will be advised to follow a Mediterranean
Diet, 2) SOC + a personalized 10 hours of TRE intervention, of 3) TRE with a provided low glycemic snack during
night shifts. All participants will undergo 6-months of guided intervention and 6 months of self-guided intervention.
All groups will be exposed to the same digital platform for the delivery and monitoring of intervention. It is
hypothesized that TRE and TRE+LGS will be effective and viable approaches to promote weight loss and
improve metabolic health in shift workers."

Wisconsin’s Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) requests
$350,000.00 per year for each of the next 3 years – for a total of $1,050,000.00 across the entirety of
the next 3 year period – in furtherance of our project “MFRPS Maintenance and Continuous
Improvement for Wisconsin’s Division of Food and Recreational Services.” This project is meant to
assist DATCP’s manufactured food regulatory program in maintaining conformance with the federal
Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS), and to thereby help advance efforts
toward an integrated food safety system (IFSS).
Wisconsin is a pioneering MFPRS state, and has long maintained a significant Standards program.
We enrolled in the MFRPS in 2007, even before enactment of the landmark national Food Safety
Modernization Act (FSMA). We have been continuously receiving related Cooperative Agreement
Program (CAP) funding since 2012. Our proven approach to the MFRPS makes us capable of both
identifying obstacles to conformance, and properly directing resources to overcome them. As evinced
in particular by our participation in the Flexible Funding Model (FFM) grant and the related CAP
over the last half-decade – as well as our ongoing work with DATCP’s food Rapid Response Team
and our Bureau of Laboratory Services – we are well positioned to support further capacity
development and activities involving an IFSS. Our approach involves an overall strategy and
methodology that is appropriate and sufficiently well-considered to accomplish the goals of this
project, as detailed throughout our application materials. We have worked, and continue to work,
effectively with the federal and state actors who are our primary MFRPS partners. As outlined in the
budget materials submitted with this application, we intend to dedicate the necessary financial
resources, particularly as to staff and overall programmatic infrastructure, to achieve the CAP goals."
10831031,"Project Summary: While previously unrecognized, it is now documented that having delivered a child within
10 years is an independent predictor of early onset breast cancer and poor outcomes. These cancers, based
largely on work from our labs, is now referred to as postpartum breast cancer (PPBC), and represents a
significant clinical problem. Every year in the US alone, ~15,000 young women (accounting for ~50% of all
young women’s breast cancer cases) are diagnosed during the high risk, postpartum period. Research in our
lab has advanced the hypothesis that weaning-induced mammary gland involution is the driver of increased
incidence and metastasis in PPBC patients. During the transitory window of weaning-induced involution, the
normal involuting mammary gland is skewed towards a pro-tumor microenvironment, as it exhibits increased
lymphangiogenesis, fibroblast activation, and extracellular matrix deposition; as well as enrichment for myeloid
derived suppressor cells (MDSC), M2-skewed macrophages, and Th-17, Th-2 and Treg skewed T cells
compared to nulliparous glands. These discoveries support our hypothesis that sub-clinical, non-life
threatening disease progresses to overtly invasive cancer during weaning-induced involution. In multiple
murine models, we confirm that the tissue microenvironment of the involuting gland increases mammary tumor
incidence and progression. Further, we demonstrate that ibuprofen (IBU) treatment targeted to the involution
window blocks >50% of these tumors from emerging, depending on model. Further, of those tumors that do
emerge, progression to metastatic disease is suppressed. One mechanism by which IBU appears to inhibit
PPBC is through anti-tumor immunity, as IBU increases the number of cytotoxic T cells, consistent with
increased immune surveillance. Importantly, we find the ability of IBU to restore the adaptive arm of the
immune system occurs in the absence of adverse host autoimmune reactions and does not impact the ability
of dams to successfully nurse their young in subsequent pregnancies. These findings support clinical utility of
IBU in the setting of a PPBC prevention trial. Our studies also identify opportunities to improve efficacy, and
vitamin D (Vit D) is proposed based on its anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity, and its safety and
particular relevance in postpartum women, who are at high risk for VitD deficiency. Here we propose to 1)
investigate the efficacy of IBU treatment in combination with vitamin D, in rodent models of PPBC with
improved human relevance, 2) identify the mechanism by which IBU +/- VitD mitigates the pro-tumorigenic
microenvironment of the involuting gland with the goal of identifying additional involution-specific targets; and
3) translate our rodent studies defining the ‘immune composition of the “at risk” involuting mammary gland to
women, by defining the immune milieu in the normal human breast across reproductive states. Only through
understanding how the normal, involuting human breast confers increased BrCa risk, can we identify additional
targets to improve the efficacy of our chemoprevention strategy and lay the foundation for PPBC prevention."
10830962,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an immunotherapy that is revolutionizing cancer treatment, but is
effective in a minority of patients. Across many cancer types, this can largely be ascribed to an insufficient
number or function of tumor infiltrating T cells positioned for reactivation by ICB antibodies. Therefore, there is
a critical need for strategies to increase tumor immunogenicity that results in a greater number of patients that
benefit from immunotherapy. Our long-term research goal is to improve responses to immunotherapy through
the molecular engineering of materials that harness endogenous mechanisms of antitumor innate immunity. To
that end, we have developed STING-activating nanoparticles (STING-NPs) – a new class of endosome-
destabilizing polymer vesicles (polymersomes) that enhance the cytosolic delivery of cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)
agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. CDNs have poor drug-like properties and
therefore suffer from poor cellular targeting, rapid clearance, and inefficient transport to the cytosol
where STING is localized. This has restricted clinical evaluation of CDNs to local, intratumoral administration,
which is not feasible for many cancer patients with advanced disseminated disease. STING-NPs enhance the
potency of CDNs by several orders of magnitude, resulting in increased tumor immunogenicity, inhibition of
tumor growth, and improved response to ICB. Our objective in this R01 application is to further expand the
utility and therapeutic window of STING-NPs by 1) optimizing their properties for safe and effective systemic
administration via an intravenous route, and 2) designing new combination therapies that leverage their
immunopharmacological properties to improve immunotherapy responses in melanoma models that are
resistant to ICB. We will accomplish this through the following Specific Aims. First, we will re-engineer the
polymersome corona to optimize the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile of intravenously administered
STING-NP to achieve maximal CDN delivery and STING activation in the tumor microenvironment. Second,
we will synthesize a new class of modified CDNs that are structurally optimized for increased incorporation and
retention into STING-NPs, and will investigate the effect of CDN structure, loading, and stability on
immunostimulatory activity and therapeutic efficacy. Third, we will develop rationally designed and clinically
relevant chemo- and immunotherapy combinations that target mechanisms of resistance to STING agonists
that we have recently identified. Overall, these studies will advance STING-NPs as a platform for increasing
tumor immunogenicity and improving outcomes of immunotherapy. In doing so, these investigations will also
advance our understanding of relationships between nanocarrier properties, pharmacological behavior,
antitumor immunity, therapeutic activity, and toxicity with potential to inform design criteria that are broadly
applicable to STING and other innate immune agonists."

at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course
epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s
increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific
interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of
research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop
expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the
conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting
women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a
successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr.
Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in
pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr.
Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research,
and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family
epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology,
mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.
 Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies,
and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including
ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the
US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by
2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop
classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body
dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how
HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research
aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the
association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes
include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative
databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience,
and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for
dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The use of developmental funds is crucial for the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC), providing
discretionary support for strategic priorities and augmenting its Research Programs and new initiatives. In the
current grant cycle, funds have supported recruitments, emerging technology Shared Resources (SRs), and
Research Program-aligned and prioritized pilot projects. In addition, the institutional support for additional
resources that expand the research scope and accomplishments has increased substantially over the grant
period. The Specific Aims of the Developmental Funds are to:
 1. Support high impact recruitments across the Center who will establish Research Programs that aim to
 provide basic, translational and/or clinical impact to cancer research in terms of the etiology of cancer,
 prevention, detection and treatment.
 2. Support innovative infrastructure emerging as new Shared Resources that enable investigators to
 conduct high quality transdisciplinary research.
 3. Support new research initiatives aligned with the Center’s Strategic Plan and coordinated through its
 Research Programs that advance new discoveries towards high-impact, and that emphasize
 collaborative efforts across programs and disciplines.
 4. Support early-phase clinical investigation through support for clinical investigators and support for
 clinical trials staff that manage these early-phase studies.
 5. Continue to leverage CCSG developmental fund investments with institutional support to expand the
 program effort and speed its overall impact across the Center.
Use of developmental funds will be aligned with the Case CCC’s Strategic Plan and coordinated through the
Executive Committee. Funds will be used to support the following activities: i) Recruitments: the Center will
identify two recruitments per year with augmented packages; ii) New Shared Resource Initiatives: the Center
will use funds to help develop new Shared Resources; iii) Pilot Grants: grants will be awarded to each
Research Program that are collaborative and interdisciplinary in order to encourage large multi-investigator
initiatives; iv) Early Phase Therapeutics: up to three clinical investigators will be supported at 20% effort each
and clinical trials support staff will be supported to facilitate investigator-initiated clinical trials."
10831579,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT 
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) is committed to the translation of laboratory insights into 
routine clinical care. This requires a deep infrastructure to support the conduct of clinical trials of new 
interventions designed to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, and improve the long-term outcomes for cancer 
survivors. The Clinical Protocol and Data Management services of the Case CCC provide a centralized resource 
for the oversight and management of clinical trials from concept development through reporting of study results. 
Services include assistance with concept development and protocol writing; feasibility assessment; budgeting 
and contracting; research nursing and data management; database development and oversight; regulatory 
management including IND applications; interactions with sponsors; study registration; quality assurance; staff 
education; and reporting of results. Data and safety monitoring to ensure the integrity of data and patient safety 
is a critical centralized function. As our goal is to ensure access to clinical trials for all of our patients, special 
efforts are undertaken to provide the opportunity to participate in clinical trials regardless of sex/gender, race, 
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or age. The Specific Aims are to: 
 1) Provide a highly efficient and coordinated infrastructure to assist clinical investigators in the development, 
 conduct and reporting of clinical trials. 
 2) Oversee data integrity and ensure the safety of patients who participate in clinical trials. 
 3) Provide access to clinical trials for all cancer patients regardless of sex/gender, race, ethnicity, age, and 
 socioeconomic status, and proactively identify and address barriers to clinical trial participation among 
 patients, providers, research staff, and healthcare systems. 
 4) Support a robust portfolio of research studies relevant to children and address special considerations for 
 children with cancer to facilitate their participation in clinical trials. 
In 2016, 2,474 patients were enrolled onto Case CCC interventional trials (73 percent increase since 2012), 
including 866 patients on treatment studies. In 2016, thirty one percent of accruals to treatment studies and 
seventy percent of all interventional accrual was to investigator-initiated trials (peer-reviewed, institutional). There 
is a substantial commitment to support of National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) studies, with 209 patients 
accrued to treatment intervention studies in the third year of the NCTN. Furthermore, in 2016 the Case CCC 
enrolled and biopsied 93 patients on the NCI MATCH trial, supported by the Clinical Trials Units via rapid 
activation, centralized registration, and coordination of tissue acquisition and processing.

10831580,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM 
Abstract 
The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is 
responsible for scientific evaluation, prioritization, and monitoring of all cancer clinical research studies 
conducted at the Center's consortium institutions. The PRMS is independent of and complements the activities 
of the Institutional Review Boards and Data Safety and Toxicity Committee. The PRMS encompasses activities 
of the Clinical Research Disease Teams and Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), with close 
interaction between these entities. The Case CCC Clinical Research Office (CRO) oversees the PRMS, as the 
central coordinator of clinical trials operations (ex, Clinical Protocol and Data Management), and associated 
committees (PRMC, Data Safety and Toxicity, Minority Accrual, and Clinical Research Operations Committee). 
The CRO is a critical resource for clinical investigators across the Center’s clinical sites, Cleveland Clinic and 
University Hospitals. The Specific Aims are to: 
1) Provide scientific review and prioritization of all applicable cancer-related clinical research protocols 
 across Case CCC consortium institutions 
2) Monitor the progress of ongoing studies to ensure that accrual is sufficient to meet scientific objectives 
The PRMC supports the research programs of the Case CCC by providing scientific review and feedback 
(including feasibility assessment), establishing prioritization, and monitoring progress of and patient accrual in 
active clinical research studies. The PRMC membership is selected to ensure diverse expertise relevant to 
cancer clinical research and is composed of clinical investigators, investigational pharmacists, registered nurses, 
biostatisticians, translational PhD scientists, and patient advocates from consortium member institutions. The 
PRMC operates as a single committee across the Case CCC consortium and reviews all new clinical cancer 
research protocols, including those sponsored by the Center, NCI, other NIH, industry, foundations, or other 
sources. These include interventional (ex, treatment, preventive, supportive, diagnostic), and non-interventional 
(ex, ancillary, correlative [tissue-based], and observational studies). The PRMC has authority to close ongoing 
studies that are not meeting accrual or performance standards and are unlikely to accomplish their scientific 
goals, and a structured process for accrual monitoring and evaluation is followed. All new protocols and protocol 
amendments that include scientific changes, such as revisions in objectives/endpoints, eligibility, 
treatment/dosing, biostatistics, and sample collection, are evaluated by the PRMC. In 2016, there were 588 
active interventional studies at Case CCC monitored by the PRMC. The PRMC reviewed 237 new studies (full 
board review: 183; administrative review: 44; tissue-based: 10). The PRMC also reviewed 330 amendments.

By harnessing the power of the immune system to attack cancer cells, adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) holds
tremendous potential to overcome the limitations of traditional cancer therapies and provide more effective and
personalized treatment options for patients. However, the effectiveness of ACT is hindered by T cell exhaustion
and the depletion of stem cell memory T cells (TSCM), highlighting the need to improve T cell phenotypes. In
several ACT trials, positive responses were closely linked with specific transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of
CD8 T cell subsets in the manufactured T cell product. Epigenetic reprogramming of exhausted cells has been
widely postulated as a promising strategy to improve ACT, but we currently lack the knowledge of which genes
and epigenetic programs to manipulate. Our long-term goal is to improve cancer treatment outcomes through
epigenetic programming of immune cells. To accomplish this goal, we have assembled an experienced and
multidisciplinary team with the relevant expertise to address the critical technological challenges and develop
next-generation ACT. The overall objective of this project is to translate epigenome editing technologies to
enable next-generation ACT through the programming of critical epigenetic nodes that govern complex T cell
phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that discovery and targeted perturbation of critical epigenetic nodes can
improve T cell function and tumor control. We will accomplish our objective by 1) prioritizing lead targets via high-
throughput epigenetic perturbation of primary human T cells, 2) identifying key transcription factors and
noncoding regulatory regions driving T cell exhaustion, and 3) investigating the combined effect of master
regulatory factors in complex T cell phenotypes. This proposal is innovative because it translates recent
developments in epigenome editing technologies and high-throughput targeted epigenetic screening to develop
precision interventions that address a fundamental limitation of effective ACT. Collectively, this work will establish
a framework for epigenetic engineering in primary human T cells, providing insights into T cell regulation and
advancing the development of an enhanced ACT platform."
10859294,"This proposal seeks to uncover the biological basis for why sleep apnea patients are more sensitive to opioid-
induced respiratory depression (OIRD) - the primary cause of death due to opioid overdose. Clinically, there
is a pressing need for new therapeutics to counter respiratory depressive effects of opioids without interrupting
their pain-killing actions and without causing unwanted withdrawal effects. We recently discovered that
oxytocin, an analgesic and anxiolytic hormone and neurotransmitter produced in a major apnea-sensitive
respiratory arousal hub, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), can prevent and reverse OIRD
by the most lethal opioid fentanyl. Notably, opioid receptor blockade with Narcan (naloxone, NLX) and
intranasal oxytocin both improve symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Our concept is that sleep apnea
patients have deficient oxytocin neurotransmission caused by an excess of endogenous opioids. This would
explain why both blocking opioid receptors and supplementing oxytocin improve sleep apnea symptoms. Our
central hypothesis is that deficient oxytocin neurotransmission from the PVH to respiratory neurons leaves the
respiratory network unable to mount a sufficient ventilatory defense response to effectively combat OIRD. This
oxytocin deficiency is modeled as an adaptive response to sleep apnea that prevents hyperventilation that
would otherwise result from tonic hyperactivity of hypoxia-sensitive carotid body chemoreceptors. Tonic
chemoreceptor activity is a well-recognized response to sleep apnea that contributes to development of
hypertension. Our working model holds that adaptive upregulation of PVH endogenous opioids by sleep apnea
becomes maladaptive when sleep apnea patients take an analgesic or illicit dose of opioid, leading to OIRD
hypersensitivity. According to our model, PVH endogenous opioid upregulation constitutes Hit #1 in a double-
hit scenario. Administration of exogenous opioid (i.e., fentanyl) constitutes Hit #2, triggering exaggerated
OIRD. Specific aims test the extent to which experimental upregulation of PVH endogenous opioids is sufficient
in normoxic mice to mimic OIRD hypersensitivity in mice exposed to our chronic intermittent hypercapnic
hypoxia (CIHH) model of SA. We will also investigate mechanisms whereby oxytocin receptor signaling
occludes the inhibitor action of opioids on respiratory neurons while also testing whether fentanyl CIHH OIRD
hypersensitivity is normalized by PVH opioid receptor blockade, eliminating Hit #1. Studies will further define
the contribution of endogenous PVH opioids in masking sleep apnea-related respiratory hyperdrive and in
blunted oxytocin excitation of respiratory neurons. Opto- and chemogenetic excitation and inhibition studies
will reveal the capacity of acute and prolonged excitation and inhibition of PVH oxytocin neurons to produce
exaggerated OIRD in normoxic mice and mitigate OIRD hypersensitivity in CIHH mice. Findings will yield new
translational information about a powerful oxytocinergic neural circuit previously unknown to opioid
resuscitation research and reveal new targets to prevent sleep apnea related OIRD hypersensitivity."
10913622,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute Graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a frequent and lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in which donor T cells destroy HLA mismatched host tissues by secreting
inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and/or inducing direct cytotoxic cellular responses. Despite recent
advances, aGVHD still remains a major clinical problem, underscoring the need to elucidate further its
mechanisms to then develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we are investigating epithelial
growth factor like 7 (EGFL7) as a potential modulator of aGVHD. EGFL7 is a repressor of endothelial cell
activation which plays an important physiological role in angiogenesis. Recently, it has also been documented
that EGFL7 plays a significant role in regulating inflammation by repressing endothelial cell activation in
response to the inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. The repression of endothelial cell activation by EGFL7
results in reduced expression of cellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM, and E-Selectin, which
results in reduced adhesion and extravasation of inflammatory cells into target tissues. Based on these data,
we hypothesized that increasing EGFL7 levels after allo-HSCT will diminish the severity of aGVHD by
interfering with the migration of T cells to the target tissues. Our preliminary data showed that treatment
with recombinant EGFL7 (rEGFL7) in two different murine models of aGVHD decreases aGVHD severity and
improves survival in recipient mice after allogeneic transplantation with respect to controls without affecting
graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Furthermore, we showed that rEGFL7 treatment results in higher
thymocytes, T, B and dendritic cells in recipient mice after allo-HSCT. Overall, our preliminary data support a
role for EGFL7 in the modulation of aGVHD. In this proposal, we would like to dissect the mechanisms by
which EGFL7 modulates aGVHD and impact on immune BM reconstitution and to perform preclinical studies
using rEGFL7 as a therapy to prevent and treat aGVHD. We are planning to achieve these goals by performing
the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To dissect the mechanisms by which EGFL7 modulates aGVHD and
impact on immune reconstitution. In this aim, we will systematically assess endothelial cell activation status
and T cell phenotypes in murine models of aGVHD after EGFL7 therapy. Furthermore, we will explore whether
EGFL7 has any direct effects on T cell function and intestinal stem cells. Last, we will investigate the EGFL7
effects on immune reconstitution. Specific Aim 2: To perform preclinical studies using rEGFL7 as a
therapy to prevent and treat aGVHD. In this aim, we would like to perform initial toxicology, pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamic studies to select the best dose and schedule to prevent and treat aGVHD. In addition,
we would like to investigate whether rEGFL7 therapy is effective in a steroid refractory aGVHD murine model.
Impact: The identification of EGFL7 as new therapy for GVHD will benefit primarily patients undergoing allo-
HSCT to cure hematologic malignancies."

Mutations in the genome of somatic cells in multicellular organisms result from DNA repair or replication errors,
causing cancer and other age-related diseases. As DNA mutations are irreversible, they represent the critical
molecular endpoint of the interaction between DNA damage and genome integrity maintenance mechanisms.
Thus, quantifying diverse mutation types in cells and tissues is essential in genetic toxicology for assessing
genetic risk associated with human exposure to environmental and anthropogenic agents. Current techniques
face challenges due to low mutation abundance and indistinguishability from sequencing errors. We propose
optimizing and validating Single Molecule Mutation Sequencing (SMM-seq), a novel approach for accurate,
cost-effective assessment of somatic mutations in normal cells and tissues. SMM-seq detects single-nucleotide
variants, small insertions and deletions, and structural variants, providing a comprehensive tool for somatic
mutational burden assessment. Our research has two specific aims: 1) optimize and validate an integrated
SMM-seq assay for measuring the mutational landscape of normal cells, focusing on protocol consolidation,
automation, and precision and recall evaluation; and 2) assess the mutagenicity of known genotoxic agents on
human primary cells. In this Phase 1, we will establish the technical merit and feasibility of SMM-seq and
develop a prototype platform, and scale up and expand applications in subsequent phases. The resulting
diagnostic product will address a market gap by providing a practical analytical tool for integrated genetic
toxicity/mutagenicity testing and monitoring human exposure to mutagenic agents, supporting the launch of a
successful business venture."

Lipids are transferred between membranes by vesicular and non-vesicular routes. Many microorganisms that
infect mammalian cells subvert the function of these host cellular lipid trafficking pathways to acquire lipids.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that multiplies in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells within
a self-made membrane-bound compartment – the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The PV of T. gondii does not
fuse with host organelles. However, we showed that the parasite’s intracellular survival relies on lipids retrieved
from various mammalian organelles. For example, T. gondii scavenges cholesterol and sphingolipids from host
endocytic organelles and Golgi vesicles, respectively, which raises the perplexing question of how T. gondii can
access the lipid content of these organelles without fusion. To address this issue, our first strategy was to analyze
vesicular trafficking pathways in infected mammalian cells. We showed that Toxoplasma intercepts mammalian
Rab vesicles associated with recycling, endocytic and secretory pathways, and sequesters these vesicles into a
network of membranous tubules appended to the PV membrane. Our second approach was to analyze non-
vesicular routes of lipid transfer, specifically Membrane Contact Sites (MCS). By examining the physical
connectivity of mammalian host organelles with the PV membrane, we showed that Toxoplasma attracts host
ER tubules and lipid droplets to the PV, where they are closely apposed to the PV membrane at distances
reminiscent of inter-organelle contacts. Mammalian ER-resident Vesicle-Associated Membrane Proteins (VAP),
components of MCS, are associated with the PV membrane, suggesting the potential exploitation of Lipid
Transfer Proteins by Toxoplasma for lipid acquisition.
 Based on these preliminary observations, we propose two models for lipid scavenging by Toxoplasma either
mammalian vesicular or non-vesicular lipid transport pathways. We will assess the steps of these models by
defining the molecular machineries and mechanisms involved in the interception of host vesicular pathways by
T. gondii (Aim 1), the formation of a network of membranous tubules in the PV and its role in mammalian
organelle sequestration (Aim 2) and the acquisition of lipids via non-vesicular transfer from mammalian
organelles closely associated with the PVM, possibly through MCS (Aim 3).
 Completing these aims would unravel the complexity of lipid salvage processes mediated by Toxoplasma,
providing mechanistic details and identifying future targets for intervention. Indeed, T. gondii can cause fatal
encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals, and current treatment options for toxoplasmosis are limited.
Furthermore, studying the mechanisms used by Toxoplasma to usurp Rab-mediated vesicle trafficking may yield
valuable insights into how Rab GTPases coordinate membrane transport in mammalian cells. Examining the
potential strategies developed by Toxoplasma to exploit MCS may also provide important information on how
the loss of MCS affect mammalian cellular physiology and organismal function."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and also an age-related neurological
disorder. AD not only causes severe distress for patients and caregivers, but it also becomes a major public
health predicament. However, the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of AD are still unclear, which
is a major challenge for AD prevention and therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that dysfunctional and aging
immune system may be a primary factor/inducer for the development of AD. Accumulated senescent T cells
have been identified in both AD patients and in aged AD onset mice, but the causative relationship between
the increased senescent T cells and AD development and progression is unknown. We recently discovered a
novel suppressive mechanism that human Treg cells can induce responder naïve and effector T cell
senescence. Senescent T cells exhibit active lipid metabolism and possess a unique senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP), producing high amounts of lipids and metabolites. Importantly, our more recent
studies demonstrated that senescent T cells can promote the aggregation of amyloid precursor protein (APP),
amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau proteins in human neuronal cells. Therefore, an improved understanding of the
molecular and cellular processes of senescent T cells in the pathogenesis of AD is urgently needed, which
could lead to the development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies. The central hypotheses of this
proposal are: 1) accumulated senescent T cells with excessive lipid metabolism promote the development and
pathogenesis of AD; and 2) blockage of senescence in T cells via lipid reprogramming is a critical checkpoint
to control AD pathologic processes and progression, which will provide a novel strategy for AD prevention and
immunotherapy. Specific Aim 1 seeks to determine whether senescent T cells with lipid metabolism disorder
are a critical driver for the pathogenesis of AD. We will dissect the causative role of the secretory lipid
metabolites of senescent T cells in reprogramming functions of neuronal cells. We will also identify the
molecular and metabolic signaling responsible for the functional changes in neurons induced by senescent T
cells, resulting in neurodegeneration and AD development. Specific Aim 2 will propose complementary in vivo
studies to identify the causative relationship between the accumulated senescent T cells and AD development
and disease progression in a spontaneous senescence accelerated SAMP8 mouse model. We will then test
our hypothesis and the novel concept that that reprogramming of T cell lipid metabolism to reverse T cell
senescence is a novel strategy to prevent AD development and enhance efficacy for AD immunotherapy. A
positive outcome of these studies should lead to novel strategies for metabolic control of T cell fate and
function for AD prevention and immunotherapy."

Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Its incidence is on the rise with 106,000 new cases expected in
the U.S. in 2021. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of early and advanced
melanoma, with concurrent anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies demonstrating a response in
~50% of patients, including highly durable responses. Unfortunately, there are no adequate biomarkers to predict
response to single agent or combination ICI, and dual checkpoint blockade is associated with significant grade
3/4 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in ~55% of patients. The goals of our PTRC are designed to address
two unmet clinical needs: (i) improve our understanding of mechanisms of resistance to ICIs to design more
effective immunotherapies and combinations, and (ii) identify potential biomarkers to select patients
appropriately for single agent vs combination immunotherapies and to predict and monitor irAEs. In our
Preclinical Arm, we will perform integrated proteogenomic analysis of clinically annotated, pre-treatment biopsies
from melanoma patients who received ICI. The data will be analyzed in the context of clinical annotations to
refine an existing signature of melanoma ICI response identified by our team and to further elucidate mechanisms
of ICI response/resistance and signatures associated with irAEs. In our Clinical Arm, we will analyze clinical trial
biospecimens using MRM-based assays to confirm & extend findings generated in the Preclinical Arm."

 Viruses have evolved a vast array of mechanisms to avoid detection and/or elimination by host
defenses and to establish persistent infections that not only ensures survival in the human population, but can
also contribute to pathogenesis. While we have developed effective antiviral drugs and vaccines against some
important viruses, the threat of viral diseases worldwide remains, largely due to antigenic drift and shift, drug
resistant mutants, emerging infectious agents, and importantly persistent or latent infections. The complexity
and diversity of persistence and pathogenesis mechanisms utilized by viruses pose major challenges to the
development of effective vaccines and chemical or immune-based treatments of virus diseases. To address
these complex problems, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying viral persistence and
pathogenesis, at the molecular level. Thus, there continues to be an urgent need to train a new generation of
independent investigators with the interdisciplinary experience and expertise to address the complex issues of
viral persistence and pathogenesis. A goal of the training program has been, and will continue to be, the
recruitment of undergraduates and recent Ph.D. graduates in related disciplines (biochemistry, biological
sciences, cellular and molecular biology, etc) into advanced studies in mechanisms of viral persistence and
pathogenesis. The training program brings together the expanding number of basic science faculty devoted to
the study of viruses and translational research in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, the
Department of Pediatrics, the Cancer Virology Program, and the Center for Vaccine Research at the University
of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and the Graduate School of Public Health. The Viral Persistence and
Pathogenesis (VPP) training program offers a unique opportunity for the coordinated interdisciplinary research
training of predoctoral trainees within the structure of the Program in Microbiology and Immunology (PMI) and
postdoctoral trainees within the laboratories of the VPP faculty, with additional training via specialized course
offerings, dedicated research seminars, retreats, and participation in national scientific meetings. Importantly,
the VPP program is unique in that it leverages concepts in persistence and pathogenesis from diverse viral
systems with the goal of educating trainees of the diversity of mechanisms, but also enabling the utilization of
common themes for their research. Support for 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees per year is
requested. The VPP program remains committed to the need to increase diversity in trainees, to provide
training in the responsible conduct of research, and to provide career guidance for trainees."
10840899,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Significant health disparities persist in childhood asthma prevalence and morbidity despite existing evidence-
based asthma guidelines that have been shown to improve outcomes. Schools are an integral partner in
asthma management. Prior literature has outlined various targeted school-based interventions with some
positive outcomes; however, these programs focus on individual components of the guidelines and take place
transiently without integration into school processes for sustainability. To more comprehensively impact
asthma care, schools have enacted policies to support guideline-based practices; however, implementation
falls short and thus these policies have not led to effective, systemic practices. Therefore, I aim to bridge the
gap in the implementation of asthma guidelines and policies by developing and evaluating a pragmatic, multi-
component school-directed, child-centered asthma program that builds upon existing targeted interventions
and is integrated in the school to foster sustainability. This innovative project contributes beyond existing
school-based programs by simultaneously and pragmatically implementing multiple components of the asthma
guidelines through school-wide systems and streamlined processes led by lay health workers. I have built a
strong foundation for this novel and important research by developing a strong partnership with a multi-campus
urban school network that serves a minority, low-income population and conducting preliminary research that
highlights the important gaps in asthma care. In this proposal, I will develop and evaluate an innovative multi-
component program in two elementary schools (Aim 1). First, I will pilot guideline-based intervention
components and determine feasibility and efficacy (1A). I will then utilize this data and existing literature about
school-based interventions to implement and evaluate a multi-component program (1B). Key outcomes will
focus on the patient (asthma control), organization (school attendance), and cost. In addition, I will determine
diverse stakeholder perspectives about the program components and the overall program as part of a pre-
implementation assessment to prepare for broader implementation and dissemination in a large, diverse urban
public school district (Aim 2).The results will be used for R01 studies that expand the application of the school-
directed, child-centered model to the large, diverse public school district in Chicago, compare its effectiveness
to other school-based asthma interventions, and conduct a full societal cost-effectiveness analysis. During this
career development award, I will work closely with my mentors and an expert advisory committee of leaders in
health disparities, asthma, community and school-based programs, implementation science, and statistical and
cost analyses. This award will allow me to obtain additional necessary training in advanced research methods
and data analysis, as well as implementation and dissemination research. The proposed research and training
will position me to become an independent investigator and national leader who integrates community-
engaged research with implementation science to advance patient outcomes and reduce asthma disparities."

Economic vulnerability and racial disparities contribute to African-American young adults being
disproportionately infected by HIV. African-Americans account for nearly half of all HIV diagnoses in the U.S.,
and young adults have the highest HIV rates of all U.S. age groups, comprising an increasing proportion of the
urban poor. Economic instability, such as homelessness and unemployment, is associated with higher HIV
prevalence. Experiencing economic instability can create imperatives to engage in survival strategies that
increase HIV risk and diminish motivations to avoid HIV, resulting in sexual risk-taking and low uptake of
preventive medications. Microenterprise interventions (i.e., very small businesses) have improved sexual
behaviors and medication adherence in low-income countries by combining HIV prevention and business
training, mentoring, and grants – primarily in women. Microenterprise reduces HIV risk through increased
economic stability via jobs and employable income-generating skills. This, in turn, decreases financial distress
associated with risk behaviors, while increasing resources to access HIV services and improving non-cognitive
skills (i.e., persistence, grit) associated with healthy behaviors. However, microenterprise studies have largely
been omitted in men and African-Americans with limited longitudinal assessment. Prior studies have also not
leveraged mobile health or behavioral economics (BE) to shape how youth perceive prevention costs and
rewards. Having obtained promising preliminary data from our completed K01 that demonstrated feasibility and
acceptability of a microenterprise pilot, the proposed R01 builds on the K01 by establishing efficacy on two
important HIV behavioral and biomedical primary outcomes: condomless sex and movement along the pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) continuum (i.e., contemplation, clinic appointment, initiation), and on intermediate
and mediating variables related to economic stability. We will implement a peer-driven microenterprise model,
adapted for underserved U.S. communities. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise in prevention science,
sexual health, microfinance, epidemiology, biostatistics, qualitative science, and behavioral economics. We will
randomize participants to experimental group that will receive entrepreneurial, financial literacy, and HIV
prevention education (i.e., condom use, PrEP), microgrants, mentors, text messages informed by BE, and job
announcements or to control group that will receive usual care job announcements. We will use respondent-
driven sampling to recruit high-risk, economically-vulnerable, HIV-uninfected seeds and their peers, aged 18-
24. To leverage peer support, we will randomize by cluster, equal to a seed and their recruits. The specific
aims are to: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on economic stability, condomless sex, and PrEP
initiation up to 24-months post-intervention; (2) Assess heterogeneity of intervention effects; and (3) Examine
mechanisms of change using statistical and qualitative methods. If found to be effective, the intervention has
the potential to be a model of HIV risk reduction and economic empowerment in U.S. urban settings."

Project Description
Recent advances in systems biology have enabled the identification of molecular predictors of treatment
outcomes for complex diseases, including asthma. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the
world, and inhaled corticosteroids are routinely prescribed medications for management of symptoms. While
generally well tolerated, the long-term use of corticosteroids can elicit serious side effects, including adrenal
suppression, an important adverse event with the potential to lead to acute adrenal crisis due to suppression of
cortisol. As 30% or more of asthma patients experience poor steroid responsiveness and require increased
doses to control asthma symptoms, these patients are at increased risk of developing adrenal suppression.
Both corticosteroid responsiveness and adrenal suppression demonstrate repeatable inter-individual variation
that is partly due to genetics; however, the genetic and molecular contributions to both steroid response and
adrenal suppression are not well understood.
Given the potential severity of poor responsiveness to corticosteroids, the ability of clinicians to predict how
asthma patients may respond could mitigate unnecessary drug exposure and reduce the risk of side effects,
including adrenal suppression. This innovation could ultimately allow clinicians to tailor treatment regimens
more precisely to avoid adverse events, thereby addressing an unmet clinical need. Pharmacogenomics bears
the promise to improve asthma care, and focusing on identifying the molecular ‘drivers’ of corticosteroid
response could significantly improve treatment outcomes for patients.
The goal of this study is to identify the genes and metabolites that contribute to steroid responsiveness in
asthma. We will clarify the molecular drivers of steroid resistance in asthma using an innovative, systems
biology-based approach that integrates genomic and metabolomic profiling of large populations with predictive
computational modeling, making the discovery of biologic implications of treatment response more likely, as no
single ‘omics’ approach is likely to lead to translatable findings. These molecular predictors could ultimately
comprise a future clinical or diagnostic test to advance precision medicine efforts for asthma treatment. In
addition, through this research effort, we will increase understanding of how adverse events such as adrenal
suppression are linked to treatment outcomes. This work is anticipated to provide novel information to drive
new treatment paradigms and, ultimately, improve patient risk profiles for asthma."

 The Scholars in HeAlth Research Program (SHARP), launched at the American University of Beirut in
2013, with the main goal to advance the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) agenda in Lebanon and the
region. It has filled a major gap and spans short-, intermediate-, and long-term research training in the region.
SHARP has exceeded pre-set expectations. Several enhancements were implemented since launch based on
our Program Evaluation (see Training Program and Progress Report). The past seven years have also
allowed us to identify few gaps, challenges and opportunities. These are : 1) interest from potential trainees in
the Summer Certificate Program but inability to free full days in a 6-week block to attend on-site; 2) a need for
advanced quantitative methods modules; 3) a need for a formal mentoring plan; and 4) scarce sources for
research fellowship stipends for trainees to support them develop and complete an NCD project. We therefore
build on SHARP’s established and successful core curricula, its solid and multi-disciplinary research training
capacity in all three training tracks, capitalize on the powerful tools in information technology, an enlarged and
multi-disciplinary panel of teaching faculty and mentors, to expand the Program’s depth, breadth, and impact.
 Our new activities are to develop and implement the following: 1) a Blended SHARP Certificate
spanning over 2 semesters, with identical competencies to the on-site version; 2) advanced research methods
modules including data science; 3) the SHARP Career Advancement Network (SHARP CAN) to cultivate a
culture of mentorship at the grassroots; and 4) the SHARP Scholars Research Fellowship Grant Program to
enhance research productivity. Therefore, SHARP continues to deliver all three training tracks, to further
advance its mission. The new Blended Certificate will run in parallel with the established on-site SHARP
Summer Program. Both provide the basis to intermediate or long-term training, including the MSc degree. The
new advanced modules complement and enrich all training tracks. The refined mentoring plan and new funding
mechanism to trainees enriches and strengthens the long-term training experience. Each year, the program
continues to enroll 20-25 on-site certificate trainees and 2-3 MSc trainees. Based on surveys we conducted,
we anticipate an additional 4-8 trainees to enroll in the new Blended Certificate Program, a cohort we expect to
grow steadily over the years, and an additional 4-8 trainees to enroll in any of the advanced quantitative
research methods modules; thus totaling 8-16 additional long-term trainees/year. Almost all trainees are
medical graduates; few may enroll at the post-doctoral degree level. The research capacity outcomes we will
track are: number of trainees enrolled/year, by gender, institution, and region, publications/trainee for the short-
term, number of grants written and secured by the trainees for intermediate-term, and trainees’ ability to
become independent investigators, secure faculty positions in NCD research, address health systems and
national health priorities, for long-term term metrics."
10842256,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Fc g receptors (FcgRs) trigger cell-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms following interactions with
immunoglobulin G molecules clustered on the surface of a target molecule, protecting the host. Extensive post-
translational modifications (PTMs) on both the FcgRs and IgG are required for this interaction, including
asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycans). IgG N-glycans vary in response to stress and disease and
compositional variability of the N-glycan can modify the affinity for FcgRIIIa (CD16a) by as much as 8-fold in
vitro. FcgRs are more heavily modified than IgG with 2-7 N-glycans as well as a handful of other known
modifications, and the Barb lab demonstrated that CD16a N-glycan composition impacts affinity by as much as
100-fold. Thus, FcgR N-glycans impact affinity more than the IgG N-glycans. However, almost nothing is
known regarding FcgR composition within the human body, how composition changes in response to stress, or
how composition impacts the structure and function of the effector cell itself (excluding preliminary descriptions
of CD16a and CD16b). The successful completion of the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide
unprecedented detail regarding the modification of FcgRs and how these modifications impact function of the
immune system. These results will also emphasize the importance of defining PTMs from endogenous tissue
for functional studies as well as provide techniques to overcome common barriers that limit studies of
endogenous receptors.
 In Aim 1.1, we will define the composition of FcgR PTMs, including: CD16a from macrophages, CD32a
from neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, platelets and basophils; CD32b from B cells and basophils; and
CD64 from monocytes and macrophages. In Aim 1.2, we will isolate NK cells and monocytes from patients with
sickle cell anemia, myasthenia gravis and neuromyelitis optica to measure the cytotoxicity of these cells and
define the composition of CD16a and CD64. In Aim 2, we will characterize the structure of the immune
synapse and the locations of specific receptors and co-receptors, the kinetics of cell killing, as well as the
kinetics of synapse formation and receptor motion using NK cells and monocytes from the patients. These
results will be compared to the characterization of PTMs on the cells completed in Aim 1. Aim 2 will also study
how specific FcgR PTMs impact immune cell function using cultured cells. Multiple sources of data from both
Aims will be collected using samples from a single donor to identify variability in the donor population. By
comparing the large amount of data collected, we expect to identify specific features of PTM composition that
impact immune cell function and that represent novel therapeutic targets."
10843306,"RESEARCH INFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE
ABSTRACT
At the heart of research are the data necessary to form and test hypotheses. The Research Informatics Shared
Resource (RI), established in 1995, creates, implements, and maintains applications and databases used by
investigators and Shared Resources at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) to capture, annotate, maintain and
access data in every aspect of research, including laboratory, translational, clinical, and population sciences.
RI’s primary mission is to serve HCI investigators by creating and integrating comprehensive information
systems that enable Cancer Center members to fully mine the data they collect. RI achieves this mission
through two specific aims: 1) to provide state-of-the-art, comprehensive research applications that enable
Cancer Center members to exploit the full power of the data they collect; and 2) to support the scientific
research objectives of the Cancer Center, in particular by centralizing cost-effective capture, integration,
analysis, and sharing of data from local, state, and national sources. The RI Director is Andrew Post, MD, PhD,
who has a broad background in informatics and healthcare data management.
RI designs custom software solutions and integrates commercial software, databases, and laboratory
information management systems for all HCI-managed Shared Resources, Disease Centers, Cancer Center
Research Programs, clinical research (e.g., Total Cancer Care/Oncology Research Information Exchange
Network), and population research (e.g., Utah Population Database). The Resource’s priorities are defined by
HCI senior leadership, who work together with the RI Director and staff to respond to Cancer Center member
research needs and opportunities. A key feature of the Resource is the coordinated nature of its databases,
software, and hardware infrastructure—all systems are designed for integration and interoperability. This
provides a highly economical model for supporting transdisciplinary and collaborative research connecting the
clinical, translational, population, and basic science research missions of HCI. All Cancer Center members
have access to RI services, with request prioritization based on customer needs. Members with peer-reviewed
funding comprised more than 33% of the users, and 148 Cancer Center members have at least one login to
applications managed by the Resource or are principal investigators on clinical trials tracked in RI-supported
systems. Additionally, RI software is essential for other HCI Shared Resource operations.
The Cancer Center and its members rely heavily on this Resource to enable high-quality research through the
customization of query tools and integration of many data sources, providing a comprehensive, well-designed,
and rich data ecosystem. RI provides efficient and reliable access to data, thus enabling and enhancing the
scientific productivity of the Cancer Center members."
10843307,"BIOREPOSITORY AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE
ABSTRACT
The Biorepository and Molecular Pathology Shared Resource (BMP) contributes to cancer research at
Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) by collecting, storing, tracking, processing, and distributing biospecimens
obtained from cancer patients receiving treatment at the University of Utah (U of U). Established in 2000, BMP
provides the critical expertise and resources to integrate biorepository, histology, and advanced molecular
diagnostics services toward the support of the clinical, translational, and basic science research at HCI. The
biospecimens provided by BMP are an essential component of HCI research projects that seek to understand
cancer mechanisms and develop new methods of treatment. BMP’s aims are 1) to serve as a state-of-the-art,
centralized biobanking resource for the collection, processing, storage, distribution, and analysis of human
biospecimens; and 2) to support the scientific research objectives of the Cancer Center by providing
researchers with cost-effective access to high-quality, clinically annotated biospecimens and their derivatives
for research studies. BMP is directed by Chris Fillmore, PhD. Management of BMP within the Cancer Center
ensures that this Resource is focused on addressing the needs of Cancer Center members.
BMP has three sections: 1) Biorepository, 2) Research Histology (RH), and 3) Molecular Diagnostics (MD),
united through pathology-based services on human biospecimens obtained from patients receiving clinical care
at the U of U. The College of American Pathologists accredited Biorepository Section provides investigators
with high-quality, thoroughly annotated fresh tumor samples, blood, and other body fluids with patient-matched
normal controls, using methods that ensure adept procurement, processing, storage, and prioritized
distribution. RH, separate from hospital histology, performs expert histology on all types of frozen and fixed
human tissues derived via the Biorepository. MD provides cutting-edge molecular diagnostic tests utilizing the
latest technologies. It uses biospecimens and histologic preparations from the other two BMP sections for
nucleic acid isolation and genetic analysis. The Biorepository manages a centralized collection of >500,000
samples: 346,000 blood or fluid samples, 116,000 tissue specimens, and 50,000 formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded blocks, all cancer-related. Currently, 6,000 cancer patient samples are collected, processed, and
banked each year by BMP. Over 23% of BMP’s users are Cancer Center members with peer-reviewed
funding, and 92% of users are cancer-related. Since 2014, over 55 publications have included work supported
by BMP. The Resource advances cancer research at HCI by providing services at highly competitive costs.
The Shared Resource adds substantial value to HCI's research efforts and is central to HCI’s goals to improve
cancer diagnosis, treatment, and cures."

10843312,"NUCLEAR CONTROL OF CELL GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION PROGRAM 
ABSTRACT 
The Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation (NC) Program is a basic science program that provides 
innovative approaches that lead to impactful understanding of the mechanistic basis of cancer development. 
The leadership, membership, and activities combine to achieve a particular aspect of the Huntsman Cancer 
Institute (HCI) mission statement—“to understand cancer from its beginnings.” This is accomplished through 
experimentation focused on mechanisms underlying basic nuclear processes and pathways that go awry in 
cancer cells and contribute to oncogenesis. NC members use innovative discovery science and preclinical 
models for the purpose of dissecting fundamental aspects of cell growth and differentiation that occur in and/or 
impact the nucleus. Within these broad goals, research in the NC Program pursues three Specific Aims: 1) to 
decipher the roles of gene dysregulation in cancer; 2) to define relationships between metabolic dysregulation 
and gene networks in cancer; and 3) to reveal altered mechanisms of DNA damage, replication, and repair in 
cancer. Each of these three Specific Aims involves the investigation of both normal nuclear processes, as well 
as their dysregulation in cancer. A deep and fundamental understanding of both states is needed to develop 
the most effective diagnostics, the best tailored therapies, and the clearest and most effective guidelines 
related to prevention—in alignment with the mission of HCI. 
The NC Program has 33 members with academic appointments in 12 University of Utah departments in three 
schools/colleges. Program members are well funded, with a strongly positive funding trajectory that is 
increasingly cancer-focused. Peer-reviewed funding totals $11.1M in direct costs, of which $3.9M (35%) 
derives from the National Cancer Institute. Program members published 329 peer-reviewed papers; 12% 
represented intra-programmatic efforts and 27% resulted from inter-programmatic collaborations. Twenty- 
seven percent of publications were in journals with an impact factor greater than 10. 
As a cancer-focused basic science program, the NC Program has a major positive impact on the Cancer 
Center through innovation and research excellence in gene regulation, cancer metabolism, and genome 
stability—as well as enhancing education and training of HCI trainees in these areas. Thus, NC provides 
discovery science that can be translated to the clinic and population, with special attention to understanding 
basic mechanisms underlying cancers of high incidence in HCI’s catchment area, including melanoma, lung, 
breast, and childhood cancers. NC Program members continue to play leading roles in cancer-focused 
discovery research and partner with colleagues in all four HCI Research Programs for translational impact."
10843313,"CELL RESPONSE AND REGULATION PROGRAM 
ABSTRACT 
The Cell Response and Regulation (CRR) Program is a basic science program at Huntsman Cancer Institute 
(HCI). CRR discovery science supports the Center’s mission “to understand cancer from its beginnings” by 
gaining new insight into basic mechanisms of cancer biology and providing a foundation for addressing critical 
clinical issues according to HCI’s strategic plan. CRR members use scientific ingenuity and the extensive 
Shared Resources provided by HCI to make new discoveries, and they collaborate with members of the 
Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program and the Experimental Therapeutics Program to translate 
these discoveries to the clinic and population in the areas of cancer prevention, target identification, biomarker 
development, prognostics, diagnostics, and treatment development. CRR research is centered on the following 
Specific Aims: 1) to elucidate mechanisms underlying cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival; 2) to 
uncover mechanisms and pathways mediating tumor metastasis; and 3) to understand tumor development and 
response to therapy. 
CRR is comprised of 37 members, representing 15 academic departments and four schools/colleges at the 
University of Utah. CRR members are well-funded, with $8.2M in peer-reviewed grant funding, of which $3.0M 
(33%) is from the NCI. The remainder of the peer-reviewed funding portfolio includes grants focused on cellular 
cancer mechanisms from the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, Susan G. Komen 
Foundation, and the American Cancer Society. Ninety-three percent of full members have current, peer- 
reviewed, cancer-focused funding. In the current funding cycle, CRR members published 266 cancer-focused 
papers; 14% of these represent intra-programmatic collaborations, and 41% stem from inter-programmatic 
collaborations. 
The synergistic aims of the CRR Program create a highly productive, collaborative, and impactful research 
environment that is bolstered by the organizational capacity, infrastructure, and Shared Resources of the 
Cancer Center. CRR fosters excellence in basic science discovery in cancer biology; 28% of this Program’s 
papers were high-impact publications (journal impact factor >10). These discoveries directly led to six new 
investigator-initiated trials in the current funding period. Program Leaders facilitate meaningful, productive, 
interdisciplinary collaborations to achieve the goal of discovering and exploiting new mechanisms that underlie 
tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our success in collaborative intra- and inter-programmatic science is 
underscored by successful competition for nine new multi-principal investigator grants in the current funding 
period."
10843315,"EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM
ABSTRACT
The Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Program at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is the hub that connects and
coordinates discoveries made in the basic sciences with translational research and clinical trials to improve
diagnostics, disease management, and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. This broad-reaching program
coordinates faculty from numerous and diverse departments conducting research on mechanisms underlying
normal and abnormal cellular biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and molecular and cell biology with
physician-scientists and clinical researchers. The overarching goal is to improve patient outcomes by
identifying and validating novel treatment approaches, fostering translational research to adapt laboratory
observations into novel interventions, and conducting clinical research to assess the effectiveness of new
treatment approaches in humans.
ET Program Aims encompass discovery and translation of HCI research into clinical practice through
development of novel treatment interventions, original investigator-initiated trials (IITs), industry trials (including
first-in-human trials), and trials in cooperation with the National Cancer Trials Network (NCTN), all with special
emphasis on cancers of particular relevance in HCI’s catchment area—the State of Utah. The Specific Aims
are: 1) to develop new cancer therapies based on discoveries from HCI science, and 2) to develop innovative
treatment interventions and conduct translational and clinical research, with special emphasis on cancers
relevant to HCI’s catchment area.
The ET Program’s 59 members belong to 15 departments within three University of Utah schools/colleges.
Peer-reviewed cancer-related funding was $4.9M at the end of 2018, with $2.6M (53%) of that from the
National Cancer Institute. Program members also hold $9.8M in industry funding. During the previous cycle,
ET members published 970 peer-reviewed cancer research papers. Of these, 20% resulted from intra-
programmatic collaborations, while 23% represent inter-programmatic collaborations. Further, the Program
houses 288 interventional treatment trials that accrued 676 patients in 2018.
The ET Program is instrumental to the success of HCI’s overall mission to improve the outcomes of cancer
patients. In particular, we: 1) translate deep basic mechanistic understandings and pioneering preclinical
translational research into original clinical trials, and 2) collect and conduct iterative analysis of specimens from
patients on clinical trials to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic sensitivity or
resistance in human beings. Going forward, the ET Program will strive to bring research full circle to fuel a
virtuous cycle of discovery, preclinical translation, clinical testing, and bedside-to-bench analyses."
10843318,"CANCER CONTROL AND POPULATION SCIENCES PROGRAM
ABSTRACT
The Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) Cancer Control and Population Sciences (CCPS) Program integrates the
broad range of research areas that define the cancer control and populations sciences field as it applies to
individuals and families in HCI’s catchment area. These research areas span studies of cancer predisposition
genetics and chemoprevention trials in high-risk patients to studies designed to improve risk communication
and risk-reducing behaviors for the most prevalent cancers. They also include explorations in health
disparities, particularly for minority and rural/frontier populations, and research to understand and improve
disease and treatment outcomes. CCPS Aims cover three broad areas of population sciences research:
cancer genetics, cancer risk reduction, and improving cancer outcomes. These support HCI's overall mission
to understand the basis of cancer and to use that knowledge to create and improve cancer treatments and
prevention measures. The CCPS specific aims are: 1) to translate cancer predisposition genetics and
genomics to the clinic and the population; 2) to develop and implement interventions that reduce cancer risk;
and 3) to explore and improve outcomes related to cancer diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life,
while simultaneously enhancing value in cancer care.
The CCPS Program has 57 members, representing 21 departments and eight schools or colleges, providing a
rich environment for discipline diversity and team science. Cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed extramural funding
in 2018 included 68 projects totaling $9.5M in direct costs. CCPS members direct their research squarely on
problems central to cancer, underscored by an exceptional record of cancer funding, with $4.9M (52%) of the
Program’s extramural peer-reviewed funding deriving from the National Cancer Institute. Between 2014 and
2018, there were 925 cancer-relevant publications from this highly productive and collaborative Program. Of
these publications, 242 (26%) involved intra-programmatic collaborations and 164 (18%) involved inter-
programmatic collaborations. The program also makes exceptional contributions to clinical trials, with more
than >7,400 accruals to investigator-initiated interventional and observational studies.
CCPS Program research has many impacts: 1) genetics and genomics work contributes to understanding
cancer from its beginnings; 2) cancer risk and cancer prevention research works to continue reducing cancer
incidence in HCI’s catchment area; and 3) the broad portfolio of outcomes studies contributes to improving
cancer diagnosis and treatment, while also reducing suffering during recovery from treatment and subsequent
survivorship. Products from these Aims are poised to impact cancer incidence and outcomes in HCI’s
catchment area and cancer care delivery broadly."

Leadership Council, the Research Executive Committee, the HCI Cabinet, and the External Advisory Board.
HCI supports training beginning with formal research opportunities at the high school level with our National
Cancer Institute-funded PathMaker Program and extending through the undergraduate, graduate, medical, and
postdoctoral fellow training phases. At each training phase, we foster multidisciplinary research in an inclusive
and diverse environment that deepens our trainees’ research skills and perspectives on the cancer challenge.
Junior faculty benefit from extensive mentoring opportunities, many in conjunction with the U of U’s National
Institutes of Health-funded Center for Clinical and Translational Science. Through HCI’s award-winning patient
and public education-focused Cancer Learning Center and a variety of outreach activities, HCI engages the
community in discussions and learning about cancer.
Additional strengths of this effort are: 1) Cancer Training 360, a course designed to give trainees a deeper
understanding of the impacts of cancer by focusing on the mechanistic, clinical, population, and psychosocial
aspects of specific cancers; 2) research experiences for high school students and undergraduates from
underrepresented groups; 3) seminars and symposia, including trainee-focused symposia; 4) opportunities for
trainees to appreciate and understand the patient experience via tumor board attendance and physician
shadowing; 5) financial support for training in transdisciplinary research; and 6) HCI postdoctoral trainee
Individual Development Plans, mentorship teams, and representation on the Research Leadership Council.
In the future, our training efforts will include additional career enhancement opportunities, introduction of
fellowship writing workshops for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, and development of additional training
and trainee funding programs that foster multidisciplinary and collaborative research."
10843322,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
ABSTRACT
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Utah, and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is the official
Cancer Center of the State of Utah, pursuant to a 2005 legislative resolution. In recognition of this charge and
the fact that >80% of HCI’s cancer patient population is from Utah, HCI defines its catchment area as the State
of Utah. Further, HCI also serves as the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in the
vast Mountain West region of the USA that includes Utah, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming.
Through thoughtful monitoring of the cancer landscape in Utah, HCI has identified, invested in, and promoted
research, prevention, and policy measures to address pressing needs of our catchment area, with the goal to
achieve the greatest and most sustainable impact. Three primary focus areas of our efforts include: 1)
Melanoma/Sun Safety: Utah has the highest melanoma incidence in the nation; 2) Lung Cancer/Tobacco
Control/Radon Reduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Utah; 3) Rural/Frontier and
other Disparity Populations: Major opportunities to address cancer health equity due to Utah's rural/frontier
geography and demographics. In addition, we have invested in areas with opportunities for innovation and
impact based on features of our catchment area: 1) Top Five Cancers in Utah for Incidence or Mortality; 2)
Inherited Cancer Risk; 3) Pediatric/Adolescent Cancers; 4) Prevention of HPV-Related Cancers.
HCI’s Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) efforts encompass two major components. The Center for
HOPE (Health Outcomes and Population Equity) leads our community-engaged and implementation research
efforts to improve cancer-related population health, and the Community Outreach and Prevention Education
office provides outreach and education about cancer risk, prevention, and care to patients and communities
throughout Utah. HCI has an impressive portfolio of catchment-area relevant research, ranging from basic-
science discovery and investigator-initiated clinical trials in our areas of focus, to a recently submitted
Melanoma SPORE, and large team science grants that engage Utah’s Federally Qualified Health Centers.
Finally, COE efforts align with our educational programs to address health equity, which include our CURE
PathMaker Program and GMaP.
HCI also works closely with two major community partners, HCI’s 38-member Community Advisory Board and
the Utah Cancer Action Network, to establish priorities for services, outreach, education, and research.
Through these and other state-wide and broader partnerships, HCI translates science to the community. We
have been successful in achieving and continue to drive policy improvements at local and national levels, with
particular emphasis on cancer-related topics of relevance to Utah."
10843324,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
ABSTRACT
Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) utilizes Developmental Funds to support critical initiatives identified via
strategic planning and evaluation, with the goal to build capacity at our Cancer Center and to further our
mission. In the coming award period, investments will be focused in four areas:
Faculty Recruitment: During the current review period, HCI doubled its research space via construction of the
Primary Children's and Families Cancer Research Center at HCI (Research South, 225,000 ft2, $119M,
opened June 2017). With the benefit of these new facilities and HCI’s programmatic resources, we aim to
increase our Cancer Center membership through recruitment of six faculty per year over the next five years
(2019-23). HCI requests Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funds for partial support of selected HCI
strategic recruitments.
Research Staff Investigators: HCI Staff investigators are supported through CCSG Developmental Funds to
enable the advancement of key strategic objectives of the Center. Lisa Cannon-Albright, PhD, is a highly
experienced user of our unique biomedical research resource, the Utah Population Database (UPDB). She
educates and collaborates with faculty interested in using UPDB to identify families with undue burden of
disease for studies. Jennifer Doherty, MS, PhD is an expert in team science, who works to enhance
collaborative interactions at the Cancer Center, mentoring both junior researchers and established researchers
in transdisciplinary approaches. She also builds cross-specialty teams that incorporate molecular
epidemiologic research methodologies or integrate epidemiology with laboratory and clinical efforts.
Developing Shared Resource: To meet the evolving research needs of our membership, HCI has created an
emerging shared resource, the Preclinical Research Resource (PRR), focused on the development and
utilization of preclinical models of disease, including patient-derived xenograft models, genetically engineered
mouse models, and organoid models. PRR supports HCI’s mission to advance the understanding of cancer
mechanisms and develop novel cancer interventions. HCI requests CCSG funds to provide partial support.
Pilot Research Funding: To support promising pilot research, HCI provides Research Programs with
institutional, non-CCSG, funding. Funds are lodged in the hands of Research Program Leaders, to directly
empower them to reach their strategic goals and to advance collaborative, transdisciplinary research
approaches. $200K/year/program is awarded to each of HCI’s four Programs. HCI also supports its Disease
Centers with funding for preliminary studies. In total, HCI invests ~$2.3M/year to support pilot research. In
addition, funds have been dedicated to programmatic investigator-initiated trials ($700K) since 2017."
10843326,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION
ABSTRACT
Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) has established leadership, planning, and evaluation processes, which have
a transformative and beneficial impact on our organization’s development, growth, and ability to capitalize on
emerging opportunities. Continued rigorous assessment and evaluation of our Center has fundamental
importance to our ability to strengthen our basic, translational, clinical, and population sciences research, and
our educational and outreach programs, all of which serve the needs of our catchment area, the State of Utah.
Internal boards that serve as decision-making bodies for HCI include the Research Executive Committee and
Research Leadership Council. Sources of information and advice to aid HCI in planning and evaluation
activities include the External Advisory Board (EAB), Internal Advisory Board (IAB), HCI Cabinet, and
Community Advisory Board (CAB). The CAB brings the perspective of the community to HCI’s efforts.
Through these groups, HCI develops coordinated plans, evaluates progress, addresses challenges, identifies
opportunities, and maximizes our potential to impact the cancer challenge. Evaluation is a priority for HCI and
is used to ensure that our resources and efforts are aligned with our priorities.
Based on input from our advisory boards and individual consultants, in the past five years, HCI has adapted its
leadership structure to better serve our needs, strategically reviewed Cancer Center membership, and
evaluated and improved HCI’s Programs and Shared Resources. In that time window, we have also doubled
our physical research space, expanded clinical and translational research activity, and dramatically expanded
our population science focus. An extensive strategic planning process culminated in the release of a new 10-
year plan, which focuses on 13 areas of priority for further growth and tactical development. The senior
leadership of our Center have begun to implement this vision to address the needs of Utahns and reduce
suffering due to cancer.
HCI supports its Leadership, in part, through CCSG funding. Planning and Evaluation at HCI is entirely
supported through discretionary funds. An NCI review of all three activities is requested, as this feedback is
critical to our progress. In the coming grant cycle, HCI will continue to build our already strong leadership team.
Frequent interactions among the Center Director, CEO, Senior Directors, and advisory boards and committees
provide depth and insight to new initiatives for our Center. The broader HCI enterprise, including our cancer
hospital, as well as our home institution, the University of Utah, remain fully supportive of the research
activities of the Cancer Center, ensuring formidable institutional support and a bright future for our Center."
10843327,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
ABSTRACT
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) serves a critical role at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) of
overseeing the successful execution of clinical research. CPDM processes yield efficient and high-quality
outcomes to support the Cancer Center in its mission to create and improve cancer treatments, with the
ultimate goal to relieve the suffering of cancer patients. The leadership of CPDM has both administrative and
clinical expertise to sustain a culture of exceptional clinical research, with clinical trials as the most important
choice of treatment for patients at HCI.
The largest centralized group within CPDM is the Clinical Trials Office (CTO, 129 FTEs), which has a well-
defined mission to support interventional treatment trials at HCI. The primary goal of the CTO is to promote
efficient completion of compliant clinical trials, while ensuring patient safety, study integrity, and streamlined
study activation. The CTO provides robust regulatory, financial, clinical, and data coordination support to
principal investigators in the HCI community. The CTO seeks a balanced portfolio serving our patient
population and encompassing rare disease clinical trials. Currently, the CTO oversees approximately 390
active clinical trials, caring for more than 1,800 clinical trial participants.
HCI conducts Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) for all investigator-initiated clinical trials, commensurate with
their level of risk and as defined in our National Cancer Institute-approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.
Trials overseen include physiologic toxicity and dose-finding studies (Phase I); efficacy studies (Phase II); and
efficacy, effectiveness, and comparative trials (Phase III).
HCI is committed to serving all residents of our catchment area, the State of Utah, including women, children,
and underserved populations. We aim to provide exceptional care and access to the latest advances in cancer
treatment through participation in clinical research. HCI maintains heightened awareness to ensure that
underrepresented minorities in our catchment area receive equitable care and opportunities for clinical trials at
our Center. Underrepresented groups in Utah fall primarily into two categories: 1) minorities based on race,
ethnicity, and low socioeconomic status, and 2) geographically disadvantaged populations consisting of Utah’s
rural/frontier residents, who have significant barriers to access to specialty care and treatment of complex
diseases, including cancer. The demographics of underserved minorities accrued to treatment trials at HCI
parallel the gender, racial, and ethnic demographics of our catchment area cancer population and the
population of new cancer patients seen at our Center."
10843328,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM
ABSTRACT
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) reviews and monitors all interventional cancer-related
clinical trials at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) and the University of Utah (U of U), providing critical support
to the Cancer Center in its mission to create and improve cancer treatments, with the ultimate goal of relieving
the suffering of cancer patients. The PRMS at HCI comprises three committees: the Institutional Protocol
Development Committee (IPDC), the Feasibility Administrative Review Committee (FAR), and the Protocol
Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC). These three committees work in sequence, using a two-stage
review process, with the IPDC and FAR in the first stage and PRMC in the second stage. These committees
ensure that all cancer-related research activities are rigorous, relevant, impactful, meet the scientific priorities
of the Center, and are feasible to complete.
The IPDC reviews concepts of investigator-initiated trials to determine whether they are ready and appropriate
for institutional support for protocol development. The IPDC assesses trial rationale, potential for significance,
and possibility for collaboration and scientific correlates to take full advantage of Center resources. Concepts
approved in this stage are advanced for full protocol development. The IPDC includes representatives from
basic science, pathology, imaging, experimental therapeutics, medical oncology, hematology, radiation
oncology, biostatistics, Investigational Drug Services, Clinical Trials Office, and Research Compliance Office.
The FAR Committee conducts a review of interventional treatment protocols to examine the logistical
operations associated with running the proposed study. The objective of FAR is to ensure all clinical trials
supported by the Clinical Trials Office at HCI can feasibly be conducted at the institution and are resourced
appropriately. FAR approval must be obtained prior to any financial or regulatory activation activities
commencing. FAR does not do scientific reviews. FAR representatives include pharmacy, specimen
processing, coordination and data management, clinical integration, imaging, and satellite site coordinators.
The PRMC provides internal oversight of interventional cancer clinical trials by evaluating the scientific merit,
priorities, and progress of clinical research of the Center. The PRMC has the authority to open trials that meet
the standards and scientific priorities of the Center and to terminate trials that do not demonstrate scientific
progress. The PRMC membership includes broad and extensive expertise in oncology research to ensure that
review of clinical protocols and assessment of progress is conducted at the highest scientific level. The PRMC
monitors accrual trends and sets scientific standards for interventional clinical trials."
10842671,"The Tantillo group applies modern computational chemistry to elucidate and manipulate the
mechanisms by which terpenes (natural products derived from isoprene oligomers) and
terpenoids (functionalized terpenes) are produced in nature. Techniques employed range from
quantum chemistry to automated docking augmented by chemically meaningful constraints. The
terpene/terpenoid class of natural products is the largest and most diverse in terms of both
structures and biological activities relevant to humans (e.g., anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory,
analgesic, anti-convulsive, anti-depressant, neuroprotective, anti-allergic, antibiotic, and others).
The overall vision for the research program is to rationally expand the chemical space of terpenes
and terpenoids using mechanistic insights obtained from computaional chemistry experiments,
thereby providing new input for the testing and development of terpene-like compounds with
potential new biological activities. A bottom-up modeling approach will be employed in which
specific contributions to catalysis and selectivity are assessed using a series of theoretical
experiments designed to reduce complicating factors (i.e., we will characterize inherent reactivity
in the absence of an enzyme using quantum chemistry, then model specific enzyme-substrate
interactions, then model the effect of active site shape using methods developed in-house that
are specific for terpene synthases). Our predictions will be put to the test via synthesis of methyl-
edited substrates and characterization of their reactions with terpene synthases we design. In
addition to providing access to new terpene synthase enzymes that produce terpene-like
molecules with new carbon skeletons and methylation patterns that can be tested for biological
activity, this multi-step, multi-scale modeling approach will hopefully transform how computational
studies on cyclization/rearrangement-promoting enzymes are generally carried out, in that it
avoids the many issues associated with assessing contributions associated with specific effects
from simulations that involve entire enzyme-substrate systems alone."
10842737,"Project Summary
Research into the proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases is undergoing a remarkable
transformation with the detailed identification of biochemical and biophysical pathways that drive
neuron stress and dysfunction. This MIRA project focuses on the cellular prion protein (PrPC), a
ubiquitous glycoprotein protein of the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Misfolding
of PrPC to its scrapie form, PrPSc, causes a range of diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD), Fatal Familial Insomnia and Kuru. In addition, PrPC is now identified as a primary
receptor for Aβ peptide oligomers that drive cytotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease. PrPC is a
Cu2+/Zn2+-binding protein that controls the anatomical distribution of these essential metal ions
in the brain. Our program, initially supported by grant R01 GM065790, elucidated the
coordination features of the metal ion binding sites, evaluated the detailed binding
thermodynamics, and developed new concepts for understanding inherited prion diseases.
Discoveries supported by this current MIRA grant find that copper and zinc promote an inter-
domain interaction in PrPC that regulates neurotoxicity, pointing to fundamentally new molecular
mechanisms of neurodegeneration. With immediate relevance to Alzheimer’s disease, we
further showed that PrPC transports monomeric Aβ to the cell interior through endocytosis. We
also developed a method for artificially glycosylating uniformly 15N-labeled PrPC and new results
show that glycans exhibit surprising control over PrPC structure. The stage is now set for us to
move in four critical directions, all with broad and profound relevance towards understanding the
molecular processes that lead to neurodegeneration and dementia. First, we will elucidate the
specific interactions between disease relevant forms of Aβ and their PrPC binding surfaces, with
particular emphasis on the unexplored role of copper. Second, we plan to use the new method
of microenvironment mapping to clearly identify membrane proteins adjacent to PrPC on the cell
surface. Third, we will develop biophysical approaches geared towards understanding how PrPC
disrupts membrane structure and compromises transmembrane voltages. Finally, we will apply
methods learned from our research on the cystinosin transporter to interrogate the structure and
mechanism of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC), recently implicated in AD."

10842834,"Summary
In the past decade, we have witnessed revolutionary progress in the attainable resolution of macromolecular
assemblies via cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of deep learning algorithms (such
as AlphaFold) that reliably predict atomic structures that can be fitted to cryo-EM maps. Whereas single-
particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving the atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in
isolation, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is widely used in unstained frozen-hydrated samples to capture
the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. The
increasing availability of high-quality maps and corresponding atomic models enables the validation of
computational strategies, yielding rigorous and reproducible modeling technologies for the future. In this
proposal, we have identified research areas for the next five years and beyond, leveraging our computational
modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) to offer the biggest value to
today’s post-revolution EM community. Our vision is to combine the converging advancements in cryo-EM,
cryo-ET, structure prediction, and rigorous validation of modeling methods into a comprehensive research
strategy. We will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and
characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. This will lead to new breakthroughs in the
flexible fitting and refinement of AlphaFold2 models as well as secondary structure prediction for medium-
resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in recent years. Medium- to low-resolution maps are
still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of
cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single-particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit
considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements
and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. As automated segmentation algorithms in cryo-ET continue to
improve, validation of these approaches has become more incumbent. Having a known ground truth on which
to base predictions is crucial to reliably testing predicted structures and modeling approaches. We propose a
software tool for the realistic simulation of “phantom” cryo-ET maps. We describe current and future
applications in the validation of cytoskeletal filament tracing methods. The collaborative efforts supported by
this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal actin filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor
arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely
through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins
for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program."
10842793,"Project Summary
Metabolomics is a rapidly growing -omics technology with vast potential, yet numerous obstacles hinder its full
utilization. The development of bioinformatics tools like XCMS Online can streamline the process of analyzing
and interpreting raw metabolic data, and further developments like integrating orthogonal data sources and
automating metabolite identification are underway. Identifying active metabolites using metabolomics and
systems biology strategies is a particularly interesting challenge that will have a significant impact on
biomedical research. My overarching goal is not only to address these obstacles, as we have a track record of
doing, but also to make our developments freely available and user-friendly and allow the entire community
and non-metabolomics experts from all fields (e.g., cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, virology,
environmental exposure, and so on) to harness the enormous opportunity of metabolomics.
To this end and based on allocated funding we’ve made multiple aspects of our platform downloadable, for
example, METLIN MS2/NL converter, METLIN Avanti MS2 data, METLIN MRM database, METLIN Retention
Time database on 80,000 molecular standards, and the just released METLIN Ion Mobility Spectrometry
database with 27,000 molecular standards (the largest of its kind), XCMS Online, XCMS-MRM and XCMS.
Continued funding will support the development of several interconnected areas of metabolism-related
biomedical research that address crucial gaps in metabolomics. These areas include automating metabolomics
data analysis, enhancing metabolite annotation and identification, integrating metabolic guidance with system
biology data, identifying phenotype-modulating metabolites, and conducting global cooperative quantitative
mass spectrometry analysis. Our research team includes multiple junior faculty investigators, including
Constantinides and Bollong, who specialize in developing approaches for organ repair regeneration treatment
and immunotherapy. For instance, we will focus on identifying potent metabolites that induce oligodendrocyte
precursor cells maturation for multiple sclerosis treatment and metabolites that improve the immunological
response in a T cell exhaustion model. Our goal is to continue promoting biomedical research by leveraging
our cloud-based technologies that currently serve over 50,000 registered users worldwide. Ultimately, we aim
to advance biomedical research by developing metabolomic technologies to their full potential.
In addition to advancing the technology of measuring and analyzing metabolic data, our prime goal is to
correlate these measurements with biological activity. To achieve this, we focus on biomarker discovery,
pathway analysis, systems biology data integration, and cognitive computing, which are crucial for identifying
metabolites that can actively modulate biological systems and ultimately fix biology with biology. Our efforts in
metabolomics development have generated an underlying excitement, as technologists we are no longer
just passive observers but active participants in solving biomedical problems. Through this work, we
strive to contribute to the transformation of biomedical research and to help usher in a new era of precision
medicine.

The overarching goal of this project is to understand how RNA splicing is encoded in DNA sequence and how it
impacts biological function and to use this knowledge to help design treatments or drugs to improve human
health. Achieving these goals requires a comprehensive and deep characterization of mRNA splicing
mechanisms and function, which can only be achieved by developing and applying novel genomic assays,
computational approaches, and analytical framework to study mRNA splicing. In this project, we propose to: (i)
develop computational methods to facilitate studies of RNA splicing in human biology and disease, (ii)
characterize splicing-mediated regulation of gene expression levels, which our preliminary findings indicate is a
common mechanism and can redefine our functional view of splicing, (iii) investigate mechanisms of RNA
splicing modulation by small molecules. Our project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding
of RNA splicing mechanisms and function and will help us leverage mRNA splicing as a target for therapies."
10842715,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mechanisms by which eukaryotes regulate gene expression are important for understanding many
complex biological phenomena including human diseases. Prevention and treatment of such diseases have
been and will continue to be improved by basic knowledge of gene regulation, especially because molecular
mechanisms of transcriptional initiation are highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms ranging from human to
yeast. This proposal will continue to investigate basic issues concerning molecular mechanisms of cleavage/
polyadenylation (3’ end formation), and mRNA stability in yeast, by combining molecular genetic, and
functional genomic approaches. It will take advantage of our novel methodologies for measuring half-lives,
structure (DREADS via chemical probes), protein binding (CLIP-READS), and poly(A) length (A-READS) of
individual mRNA 3’ isoforms. Our previous work identified strong and unexpected mechanistic links between
transcriptional elongation, cleavage/polyadenylation, and mRNA decay. Novel findings include a nucleotide-
level link between elongation and cleavage/polyadenylation, condition-specific 3’ isoform half-lives and mRNA
stability elements, and a compensatory mechanism in which the rate of cleavage/polyadenylation in the
nucleus is linked to 3’ isoform stability in the cytoplasm. The proposed experiments represent a highly
integrated approach to study the generation, structure, stability, and regulation of 3’ isoforms on a
transcriptome scale. In addition to our previous experiments that involved relatively stable cytoplasmic
mRNAs, the new studies will use a metabolically labeling, pulse-chase approach to analyze newly-synthesized
RNAs that are generated in the nucleus prior to transport to the cytoplasm. First, for polyadenylation, we will
(A) define the sequence requirements for 3’UTRs by generating large libraries of yeast cells each of which
contains a genetically modified 3’UTR, B) use the 3’UTR cell libraries to address the mechanism(s) by which
polyadenylation is restricted to the 3' UTR. C) identify factors that are responsible for the wild-type poly(A)
pattern, D) determine the mechanistic basis for how individual proteins involved in transcriptional elongation,
cleavage/polyadenylation, and mRNA decay affect poly(A) profiles of some genes but not others, and E)
elucidate 3'-isoform variation and regulation of poly(A) tail length. Second, for studies of mRNA
stabilization/destabilization elements and half-lives of 3' isoforms, we will A) perform RNA structural analysis
during the degradation process, B) identify proteins that affect/mediate the large differences in mRNA isoform
stabilities C) perform directed genetic experiments to address how secondary structure affects mRNA stability,
D) elucidate our recently discovered compensatory mechanism between cleavage/polyadenylation and mRNA
decay, E) identify isoform-selective mRNA-binding proteins, and F) investigate the mechanism of condition-
specific isoform half-lives and stability elements that we recently identified. Overall, the proposal will answer
fundamental questions about the interlinked processes of transcription, polyadenylation, and mRNA stability."
10842767,"Project Summary
Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic diversity upon which other evolutionary forces—natural se-
lection, genetic drift, recombination—act. As such, mutations impose fundamental constraints on what
phenotypes can evolve, but we lack a theory for understanding these constraints. Two overarching goals
of my lab’s research are to (i) develop a theory for predicting the phenotypic and fitness effects of new
mutations across genotypes and environments and (ii) understand how evolution proceeds on the emerging
“fitness landscapes”. We take three complementary approaches to achieve these goals. Our first approach
is theoretical. Even the simplest unicellular organisms are complex biochemical machines, but it is unclear
how this biochemical architecture constrains the structure of the resulting fitness landscapes and the rules
by which mutations “move” the organism on this landscape. We are developing mathematical theory for
understanding these constraints, focusing initially on fitness landscapes that emerge in complex metabolic
networks. Our second approach is empirical. While we construct the theory from first principles, we will
also use tractable experimental systems, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterium
Escherichia coli to directly measure the effects of mutations on some cellular phenotypes that are im-
portant for microbial fitness, e.g., the transcriptome. Our goal here is to identify broad and hopefully
general statistical patterns in how the effects of mutations vary across genetic backgrounds and environ-
ments that will help us narrow down and parameterize our theory. One practically important outcome of
this work that we hope to achieve is the ability to predict the evolution of collateral antibiotic resistance.
Our third approach is exploratory. If our theoretical and empirical efforts mentioned above are successful,
they will give us a handle on predicting evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in controlled laboratory
conditions. However, by necessity, these conditions lack many of the complexities of natural environ-
ments. We would like to understand how the evolutionary process in such more complex environments
differs from what we can observe and potentially predict in simple controlled laboratory conditions. To
this end, we will apply some of the cutting-edge experimental tools, such as whole-genome time-course
sequencing, to observe evolutionary dynamics in microbial systems of intermediate complexity, in partic-
ular, in a two-species microbial community that we already developed and in a semi-natural marine mi-
crobial system that we plan to develop with our collaborators."
10842716,"The discovery of new medicines requires the synthesis and evaluation of new molecules, and the
incorporation of saturated atoms and three-dimensional (3D) shape is increasingly important in advancing
bioactive leads to medicines. Recognizing this need to incorporate saturated carbons, including stereocenters,
this research will focus on the development of new cross-coupling reactions to enable efficient construction of
bonds to saturated carbon atoms. These methods will rely on alkyl alcohol and amine derivatives as alkyl
electrophiles, because they are widely available (including in enantioenriched form), offer outstanding diversity
of alkyl fragments that is complementary to other alkylating agents, are easily prepared, and can be used in both
early and late-stage functionalization strategies.
 All-carbon quaternary stereocenters and other fully substituted stereocenters are prevalent in bioactive
natural products, but these motifs remain synthetically challenging to prepare in high enantiomeric purity,
especially if they are not near a carbonyl or alkene. On the other hand, tertiary alcohols are readily prepared in
exceptional enantiomeric excess (ee), making them ideal substrates for stereospecific cross-coupling reactions.
Building on strong preliminary results, this program will develop a suite of methods to deliver highly
enantioenriched products from tertiary benzylic alcohol derivatives. These efforts will be bolstered by mechanistic
studies to understand and rationally optimize challenging steps in these catalytic processes.
 Primary alkyl amines comprise an extremely diverse feedstock class, extending from simple building blocks
to pharmaceutical intermediates to biomolecules. By activating them as Katritzky pyridinium salts, the PI’s group
was the first to show that these ubiquitous starting materials can be used as alkyl electrophiles in nickel-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions. This program will now develop new deaminative cross-couplings to provide efficient
access to a tremendous diversity of products, meeting needs in medicinal chemistry efforts for pharmaceutical
discovery.
 The successful development of this research will establish novel methods to deliver 3D molecules with
potential bioactivity from readily available precursors. It will also change the way that chemists use alcohols and
amines in synthesis. The ultimate goal is to develop cross-coupling methods for forging bonds to C(sp3) atoms
that are as useful for the preparation of bioactive molecules as those long known for C(sp2) atoms. By enabling
new methods for the synthesis of novel, potentially bioactive molecules, this research will advance the discovery
of new molecules for the study and treatment of disease."
10842722,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of my laboratory is to understand the role of extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNA) in development and
stress response and how these processes are dysregulated during disease pathogenesis. EcDNA are linear or
circular fragments of DNA separate from the cells normal complement of chromosomes and have been identified
in multiple species and healthy tissues. ecDNA are elevated in cancer where they frequently harbor oncogenes
and can contribute to drug resistance and therefore may be important potential therapeutic targets. However,
we currently lack a fundamental understanding of the biogenesis, regulation, maintenance and selection of
ecDNA. My laboratory seeks to answer these fundamental questions surrounding ecDNA to facilitate
understanding the role of ecDNA in normal biological processes and their dysregulation in disease.
We have uncovered that multiple environmental stress responses cause cells to use targeted DNA rereplication
events to produce ecDNA. This MIRA proposal aims to understand which stress responses utilize ecDNA
production, identify the epigenetic regulators of these loci and develop methods to assess the importance of the
extra gene copies independent from the chromosomal locus. This work will provide fundamental insights into a
relatively unexplored pathway in environmental stress response that is quite commonly dysregulated in cancer.
The work in this MIRA represents roughly 50% of the work in the laboratory. Our other research projects
synergize with this work as they investigate the role of ecDNA in two disease contexts, breast cancer and Down
syndrome (DS). The work in breast cancer leverages newly discovered ecDNAs produced during epithelial to
mesenchymal transition as a potential novel therapeutic target to help reduce metastatic breast cancer. Our work
in DS investigates how cells with trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21; the genetic root of DS) fail to produce ecDNA
from stresses associated with comorbidities for individuals with DS.
In the next 5 years, the combined work from these projects will synergize to provide greater understanding on
the generation of ecDNA and their importance both in normal stress response and dysregulation in disease. We
will uncover novel methods to prevent ecDNA formation allowing us to assess the importance of the extra gene
copies independent of the endogenous chromosomal locus. We will establish a better fundamental
understanding of how epigenetics establish permissive chromatin environments for ecDNA production and have
identified specific enzymes that could be leveraged in the future as potential therapeutic targets. We will identify
signaling and regulatory pathways that control ecDNA connecting stress sensing to ecDNA production."

Enzyme catalysis is one of the most important phenomena in biochemistry and yet is incompletely understood.
New time-resolved serial crystallography methods now allow enzyme catalysis to be observed in real time, in
near-physiological conditions, and at atomic resolution, allowing new classes of experiments to be performed.
The central goal of this proposal is to both develop and use innovative structural biology methods to understand
the underlying physical principles of enzyme function. We will use time-resolved serial crystallography to
determine how catalysis changes enzyme structure and dynamics in cysteine-dependent enzymes. Our initial
focus is on various enzymes in the DJ-1 superfamily involved in parkinsonian neurodegeneration, isocyanide
antibiotic destruction, and carbonyl stress mitigation. A second contributor to enzyme catalysis is quantum
mechanical effects, some of which are becoming accessible to large computational simulations and experimental
characterization. We will determine how neglected quantum mechanical effects affect enzyme catalysis by
incorporating time-resolved crystallography, computation, and biochemistry to investigate pervasive evidence of
quantum mechanical charge transfer in catalysis. These scientific goals will be pursued concurrently with the
development of new methods to expand the scope and power of time-resolved structural biology experiments
by reducing barriers to performing these experiments. In total, this work will use new technologies to improve
the understanding of fundamental enzymatic phenomena and broaden the application of time-resolved structural
biology."

This renewal application (2020-2025) requests support for the Work Environment program at the University of
Massachusetts Lowell to continue its current training program grant with two funded occupational safety and
health training programs: a) Occupational Safety/Ergonomics (OS/E) in the College of Engineering; and b)
Occupational Epidemiology (Occ Epi) in the College of Health Sciences. These programs have been funded by
NIOSH since 1991. They had been housed in the Department of Work Environment until 2016 when that
department was merged with another to form the Department of Public Health. In 2018, Drs. Buchholz and
Punnett, the Program Directors for each of these two programs, moved to the Department of Biomedical
Engineering.
The mission of the program, to train work environment professionals and conduct research on the identification
and evaluation of safety and health hazards and the design of safe and efficient alternatives, thereby
promoting the development of healthy and sustainable workplaces, has not changed. In this mission, we are
guided by an overarching vision to: design and promote systems of production that are environmentally-sound,
safe, healthy and rewarding for workers, communities, and consumers. Our integrated approach to health and
safety strives to answer the basic question, “What is the optimal design of a healthy workplace, and how can it
be achieved?”
Trainees, regardless of discipline, will be required to complete a three-course core: Work Environment Policy &
Practice; Ergonomics & Work and Epidemiology & Biostatistics. In addition, all students will need to complete
an occupational health & safety based project. The program’s integrated curriculum has three broad academic
objectives: (1) recognition and evaluation of occupational safety and health hazards; (2) control and prevention
of occupational safety and health hazards; and (3) development and implementation of workplace interventions
including safety and health programs, as well as other social and economic policies.
Graduates of the Work Environment program include many successful practitioners and researchers whose
careers in occupational safety and health indicate overall success towards these goals. The proposal requests
five years of funding to support a total of six graduate trainees: three trainees each in OS/E and Occ Epi. It is
expected that we will, in general, support masters trainees for two years, but will also occasionally support
doctoral students."

annually. Approximately 98% of the trainees enter the OS&H workforce upon
graduation. This complements NIOSH’s goal of achieving nationwide improvements in
health by filling the regional and national demand for OS&H professionals.
Proposed Training: The main goals of the Training Program Grant (TPG) are to; (1)
provide tuition & fees support to qualified students in the OSEH program, (2) help in
recruitment & retention of qualified minority & underrepresented students, and (3)
supplement student and faculty travel to professional conferences identified by NIOSH
as essential to program objectives.
Industry Advisory Board: Assessment of the OSEH Program relies on the expertise of
industry professionals who generously share their knowledge of today’s work
environment as members of the OSEH-IAB. The members are charged with the
responsibility to provide leadership, program assessment and guidance through their
active engagement in the ongoing refinement of the OSEH curriculum.
 Trainees: All students covered under this program are pursuing a Bachelor of Science
degree in OSEH. Admission to MU is granted without regard to race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, ancestry, age, handicap, marital status or lifestyle. Funding is requested
to support six students with tuition and fees at an estimated cost of $5168/semester per
student for the duration of the project (2020-2025).
Training Facilities: The laboratory facilities dedicated to the OSEH program include
separate areas dedicated to Safety Engineering, Fire Prevention & Control, Industrial
Hygiene, and Ergonomics. These facilities have provided an opportunity to expand the
laboratory component of the curriculum, and to increase opportunities for students to be
involved with research projects at the undergraduate level."

of 65, leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Although the National Plan to address AD
seeks to accelerate research toward treatments, there is a shortage of scientists necessary to conduct a wide
variety of interdisciplinary research projects. The Buck Institute's Support and Preparation for an Alzheimer's
Research Career (SPARC) Program will address this need by recruiting a diverse group of postbaccalaureates
and training them in a geroscience-inspired approach to ADRD research. This interdisciplinary approach will
investigate the contribution of common processes governing aging on the development of ADRD. The diverse
research expertise and collaborative culture of the Buck Institute provide a unique training environment to
ensure the next generation of researchers in the field are provided the knowledge and skills to reduce the
burden of ADRD. The SPARC Program will be designed to increase participation of students from
underrepresented groups in ADRD research and prepare them for additional training in advanced degree
programs or private sector research careers in AD-related disciplines. Recent college graduates will be
recruited using college and university online programs, such as Handshake and Simplicity. Partnerships with
non-profit organizations that support underrepresented students, such as Students Rising Above and Biotech
Partners, will enhance recruiting efforts. A one-month Introductory Training Period will familiarize
postbaccalaureates to core research concepts, and shadowing opportunities in prospective host labs will
ensure strong mentor-mentee matches during the eleven-month mentored research project, which will continue
to be bolstered by training activities. Foremost, a mock grant proposal writing assignment and mock study
section will provide framework for SPARC Researchers to digest literature associated with their project as well
as develop their scientific writing skills. Oral presentation skills will be practiced with presentations to both a lay
and scientific audience. In addition to serving as a training opportunity for SPARC Researchers, the lay
audience presentation also will provide an outreach opportunity to introduce local high school and college
students to ADRD research and career opportunities. The scientific writing and presentation assignments not
only will help SPARC Researchers understand their projects better but also prepare them for discussion of
their research in future applications and interviews. Mentors will provide additional career support both during
and after completion of the program through application feedback, interview practice, and networking
introductions. Training alumni can provide additional peer support through job or advanced degree program
advice, application or interview suggestions, and alternative career options. In summary, the training provided
by the Buck Institute's SPARC Program will recruit and prepare a cohort of students from underrepresented
groups for further advanced studies or a career in geroscience-inspired ADRD research."
10847577,"Project Summary/Abstract
The mission of the proposed U-RISE at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (U-RISE@Wπ) is to develop a research
training and mentorship transdisciplinary program and strengthen our inclusive community to nurture the academic
success of our undergraduate students. The program will guide our undergraduate students — especially from
underrepresented (UR) populations — towards successful enrollment and completion of PhD programs in the
biomedical sciences and engineering with a fun, cohesive structure, and supportive research ecosystem. Our
objective is to bring together faculty from nine departments and leverage our project-based curriculum,
recognized as being the best for combining scholarly research with classroom instruction to meet our goals
through three intersecting specific aims: Aim 1: To create a framework for education: we will leverage
common curriculum elements spanning across multiple degree programs, involve course-based undergraduate
research experiences (CUREs) and individually mentored undergraduate research experiences (UREs), and
culminate in an intensive senior capstone URE. Each project contributes not only to the student’s knowledge
base, but also to research skills such as teamwork, time management, literature reviews, and communication,
both written and oral. Aim 2: To build a supportive community: our programs will build an inclusive community
through coaching, mentorship, personal development workshops, retreats, and cohort experiences. Aim 3: To
strengthen the WPI research ecosystem through training: we will enhance the WPI research experiences for
all students with an evidence-based tiered mentoring and coaching system for faculty and students and provide
training in communication, safety, responsible and reproducible research practices, and applying for fellowships
and graduate school. This program is needed at WPI to level the playing field. While we have made strong
progress in increasing the proportion and success of female students at our science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM)-focused institution, we have had less success with other UR groups in STEM. Most
notably, our Black students have expressed feelings of loneliness and a lack of sense of belonging and have a
disproportionately high failure rate. Our goal is to improve the retention and graduation rates of students from
these UR groups by creating small teams of undergraduate researchers, each with a Faculty and Peer Coach
dedicated to each student’s success, regardless of incoming level, background, and self-confidence. Our
evidence-based approach is focused on mentoring and training with the additional value of coaching methods
which provide guidance, feedback, and resources to help Trainees acquire necessary skills, cultivate their self-
efficacy, and achieve their goals outside of the mentored research and evaluation approach. Trainees will
continuously be guided – with mentorship and coaching – through to completion of undergraduate studies and
onto graduate and fellowship applications in research-focused biomedical higher degree programs."
10852067,"Microvascular insufficiency and in turn, tissue ischemia and necrosis, contribute to a variety of chronic diseases,
and can be an adverse outcome of common reconstructive and plastic surgeries. The goal of this project is to
advance a novel ultrasound-based technology to induce neovascularization directly in vivo, and thereby enhance
local tissue perfusion. Acoustic patterning utilizes radiation forces associated with an ultrasound field to rapidly
and non-invasively organize cells or microparticles volumetrically into defined geometric assemblies. We have
shown that in vitro acoustic patterning of endothelial cells within collagen hydrogels leads to the formation of
three-dimensional microvascular networks, and that acoustic field parameters employed for patterning influence
microvessel morphology. In our recent studies, in vivo acoustic patterning of endothelial cells within injectable
hydrogels resulted in formation of perfused microvascular networks in a murine model, providing the first proof-
of-concept demonstration that non-invasive, acoustic cell patterning can be used to fabricate functional
microvascular networks directly in vivo. An important advantage of ultrasound is its ability to propagate through
tissue as an acoustic beam, thus offering avenues to rapidly translate this technology toward in vivo tissue
regeneration. Research and development in three key areas are necessary to advance acoustic patterning
towards clinical translation: i) development of systematic protocols to fabricate functional microvessel networks
within patterned hydrogels, ii) engineering innovative instrumentation for acoustic patterning in vivo, and iii)
demonstrated efficacy of the technology in a preclinical model. We address these key areas as follows. Aim 1
will identify sets of acoustic parameters, along with hydrogel and cell combinations, that give rise to functional
microvascular networks, in a manner that allows for predictable control over the morphology of three-dimensional
microvascular networks. Aim 2 will advance two acoustic instrumentation systems, a dual-transducer system
and a phase holographic lens transducer, to provide versatile systems for efficient, site-specific patterning in vivo.
Aim 3 will evaluate the efficacy of our in vivo acoustic patterning strategies using mouse models of tissue
vascularization and ischemia. Completion of this project will advance in vivo acoustic patterning technologies for
tissue vascularization to address a range of clinically relevant scenarios of tissue ischemia."
10862620,"The goal of understanding psychiatric disorders and advancing psychiatric treatments requires basic
knowledge of not only what environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors underlie function and dysfunction,
but also how these factors alter the circuit-level computations that are the proximal neural events to behavior.
The advent of research in this area holds the promise of linking core computations of neural circuits to complex
human behavior, with the ultimate goal of developing comprehensive, multilevel transdiagnostic models of
neuropsychiatric disorders. Consequently, the emerging field of computational psychiatry is central to the
NIMH mission. Despite its importance, there are very few opportunities to pursue training in this area.
Consequently, the proposed training program seeks to take recent PhDs, with strong backgrounds in fields
such as neuroscience, engineering, applied math, and computer science, and provide them with the tools to
make important contributions to the nascent field of computational psychiatry. The proposed Training Program
in Computational Psychiatry (TPCP) will take place at Brown University where there is a critical mass of basic
researchers on the main campus and clinical researchers in the Department of Psychiatry and Human
Behavior to conduct such a training program. We propose enrolling six fellows (3 per year) in the TPCP with
the goal of training, more efficiently and effectively, nonclinical research fellows capable of collaborating with
clinical researchers to advance knowledge of psychiatric disorders and treatments. The program embraces an
apprenticeship model in which fellows work with a primary research trainer in a computational field and a
secondary research mentor in clinical psychiatry. In this apprenticeship model, the trainer works closely with
the fellow and a secondary clinical psychiatry mentor, who is conducting research in areas such as
neuroimaging, neurostimulation, and digital phenotyping. These research areas are especially conducive to
addressing important issues in computational psychiatry, whether they be model/theory-driven or data-driven.
The proposed didactic program will include both core seminars and an individualized curriculum including
fellow-selected courses in neuroscience, computer science, engineering, applied mathematics, or psychiatric
disorders. All fellows attend core seminars on grant writing, responsible conduct of research, and rigor and
reproducibility. The short-term final product is an NIH grant application on a computational psychiatry topic.
The long-term goal is to produce a new cohort of academics who can conduct research in computational
psychiatry and train the next generation of graduate students in this emerging field of inquiry."
10862794,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alternative splicing is a key process in shaping the functional complexity of the brain. Accordingly, many
neurologic and psychiatric disorders are caused by mutations in RNA binding proteins or their targets in
alternative splicing. The Rbfox family of RNA Binding proteins regulate alternative splicing during neuronal
development and their mutations have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder and various familial
epileptic disorders. To understand the role of Rbfox in these diseases, many studies have focused on how
individual Rbfox proteins bind to their targets and regulate their splicing. However, Rbfox proteins are also
known to interact with cofactors that influence their function. We previously found that nuclear Rbfox proteins in
the mouse brain are almost exclusively bound to a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR). However, it
remains unknown what the full subunits of the neuronal LASR complex are and how they interact with Rbfox to
regulate alternative splicing in neurons. In this proposal, I will define the neuronal components of LASR,
determine the transcriptome-wide targets of the LASR/Rbfox complex and its subunits in the mouse brain, and
analyze how components of LASR affect Rbfox’s splicing regulatory activity in neurons. These studies will
elucidate how combinatorial interactions between RNA binding proteins in a novel splicing regulatory protein
complex shape the gene regulatory circuit of the brain and will further our understanding of the function of the
Rbfox proteins which have been implicated in epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder."
10837886,"The brain is presence of phosphorylated deposits of the neuropathological hallmark of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, in retrospective studies, TDP-43 proteinopathy was shown to be associated with substantial cognitive impairment that mimicked the Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical syndrome. The co- existence of TDP-43 pathology in brains with neuropathological change of AD (ADNC) has been reported in 30-70% of AD cases, predominantly affecting predominant Recent subtype limbic and associated areas in a pattern called limbic- age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC). studies have shown that LATE-NC is also found in individuals without ADNC, postulating a new ofTDP-43 proteinopathy designated as LATE. LATE is one of the most prevalent subsets of TDP-43 proteinopathies observed in ~30-50% of people who die beyond 85 years of age. When comparing LATE-NC with FTLD-TDP cases, recent studies have shown that besides distinct clinical manifestations, there are also differences in epidemiological, genetic, and neuroimaging features.  From a neuropathological standpoint, LATE-NC and FTLD-TDP individuals share some features of TDP-43 pathology. Since phosphorylated TDP-43 was identified as the major component of ubiquitin-positive inclusions in FTLD-TDP, five distinct FTLD-TDP histopathological distribution and morphological features of TDP-43 aggregates (type between clinical symptoms, genetic forms of FTLD-TDP, and TDP-43 neuropathological subtypes have been established based on characteristic A to E) features . The association in FTLD-TDP brains have been extensively reported. Interestingly, although TDP-43 pathology in some LATE-NC cases resembles FTLD-TDP type A, a distinctive neuropathological feature related to TDP-43 proteinopathy in elderly individuals is type “Alpha” (similar to type A) or type “Beta” (co-mingling with tau tangle structures) pattern of TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the amygdala. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the heterogeneity of the TDP-43 proteinopathies is still unknown. Such heterogeneity supports a “strain hypothesis” wherein unique pathogenic TDP-43 species (a.k.a. strains) with different conformations may play a role in such diversity. Our objective is to isolate pathogenic TDP-43 species present in FTLD-TDP and LATE-NC brains and characterize their biochemical properties and biological activities in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1). We will then generate in vitro brain-derived TDP-43 strains that recapitulate the characteristic features of their human counterparts (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether there are differential pathophysiological signaling pathways associated with neuropathological changes of TDP-43 pathology in the brain by performing spatial profiles between distinct TDP-43 proteinopathies transcriptomic analysis and comparing the expression (Aim 3 )."
10837888,"Project Summary
 How cell to cell signaling networks control stem cell maintenance and development is a
fundamental question in biology. Cell to cell communication and stem cell maintenance are
critical for human development and both contribute to disease states when disrupted. The ability
to manipulate cell signaling pathways or utilize stem cells to treat human disease remain
outstanding goals. As such, understanding how cell to cell signaling networks function is critical
for diverse public health challenges. My lab uses the well-established and tractable model plant
system, Arabidopsis, to take a multi-level approach to dissect the receptor kinase pathways that
control development and stem cell proliferation. Arabidopsis offers many technical benefits which
make the dissection of such signaling networks feasible. In addition, stem cell niches and other
developing tissues can be monitored live in whole organisms and are easily accessible and
amenable to experimental manipulation in a manner not feasible for many models.
 The proposal will support a series of projects that collectively aim to understand the function of
peptide receptor kinase signaling in stem cell regulation and development. The projects will
identify downstream components in receptor signaling pathways, examine how these pathways
control cell division across diverse tissues, characterize different classes of proposed
transcriptional regulators in these pathways, identify the target genes these regulators control,
and examine how these pathways integrate with hormone and temperature signaling inputs. The
projects will compare diverse stem cell niches and developmental processes to gain insight into
how peptide signaling pathways shape divergent cellular behavior in different contexts. The
proposal will train scientists at the post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. This work
will benefit from collaboration with expert groups, including a group that works on peptide
receptors which function in pathogen peptide detection during immune responses, thus allowing
us to compare receptor kinase signaling mechanisms across development and immunity.
Ultimately, the project aims to understand these pathways at a level that will allows us to engineer
novel synthetic pathway components which could be used to reprogram plant growth and even
be deployed in heterologous animal systems, potentially leading to future human therapeutic
applications."

Due to massive vaccination, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been partially under control.
However, emerging contagious variants such as Delta are still fueling new waves of infections
around the world. Vaccine-escape (or vaccine-breakthrough) variants pose renewed threats to
our battle against COVID-19. Understanding viral mutagenesis and evolution is of preeminent
importance. By integrating genomic analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), computational biophysics,
advanced mathematics, and experimental data, the PIs have built a comprehensive program with
the experimental level of accuracy and population-level of reliability for predicting SARS-CoV-2
variant infectivity and antibody disruption. It remains challenging to forecast future emerging
vaccine-escape variants, to develop the next-generation of vaccines, and to design mutation-
proof antibody therapeutics. These challenges are tackled in the proposed project. New
mathematical tools and AI algorithms will be developed to further improve the current state-of-
the-art in predicting mutation-induced viral infectivity changes, vaccine breakthroughs, and
antibody disruptions. Vital mutations in future emerging variants will be forecasted based on
molecular mechanisms, natural selection, and evolutionary effects. New mutation-proof antibody
drugs will be designed and tested based on those antibodies that had gone through earlier clinical
trials. The predictive models will be implemented into a user-friendly platform with online servers
for researchers to design mutation-proof new vaccines and antibody therapies. The proposed
methods will be applied to forecast emerging variants in the flu and improve the efficacy of
seasonal flu vaccines."
10837802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no
consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for
understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome
heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy
have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI
imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which
may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal
will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long
term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment
responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle
MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in
the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a
leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state
of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification
schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the
framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial
using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich
resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center
of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both
renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized
myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has
recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific
expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These
include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr.
Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and
Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed
to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in
advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal."
10837810,"To tell a story, give directions, or describe the layout of a house, speakers must generate multiple utterances in
sequence. Because most psycholinguistic research on speaking is based on paradigms designed to elicit
single utterances, little is known about multi-utterance language production in children and adults. Linked to
this empirical focus on single utterances is the widespread use of a method in which subjects describe simple
visual images containing just a handful of objects shown in straightforward spatial arrangements. In contrast,
real world scenes contain multiple objects in various relationships that can be described in numerous ways,
and so the attentional and language systems face a challenging set of decisions concerning where to begin the
description, how to cluster objects and capture their relations, and what information to include or omit. This
project uses complex, real-world scenes as a tool to examine the linearization of complex thoughts into
sequenced utterances, focusing on adults at this investigate stage in order to establish developmental
benchmarks. Image and semantic characteristics of complex scenes will be precisely quantified and used to
generate predictions about the allocation of attention as a scene is viewed and described. The project
examines the conditions under which scene image features exogenously draw the eyes to specific visual areas
which the linguistic system then describes, and under what conditions the cognitive system guides the eyes to
meaningful regions of the scene, allowing the language system to prepare a description even before the
relevant object or region has been fixated. On this latter view, the language and cognitive systems use scene
meaning interactively to formulate a linearization plan for coordinating the production of multiple utterances. To
address these theoretical issues, the project focuses on three Specific Aims: (1) To use computational tools
from the field of visual cognition to measure image and meaning properties of complex scenes, which will
permit the precise quantification of features controlling attention during speaking tasks as well as the selection
and sequencing of linguistic content. (2) To determine the extent to which viewers predict the presence of
objects and their locations and use those predictions to get a head-start on linguistic encoding even before an
object is attended. (3) To extend our approach to the production of utterances describing events by applying
the same methods for quantifying scene image and meaning properties that have been developed for nonevent
scenes to scenes depicting events with and without animate agents. The project tests an innovative
theory of multi-utterance language production which assumes that speakers formulate a linearization plan to
guide the allocation of attention and linguistic decisions concerning inclusion and ordering of information. This
approach will lead to a deeper understanding of language production, which will lead to identification of
testable, rigorous hypotheses concerning the emergence of these processes across development."

The main goal of this grant proposal is to investigate the interaction between regulatory T (Treg) cells and
reactive astrogliosis in the context of brain metastatic disease, and their impact on the brain metastatic process.
Brain metastasis represents the final stage of cancer, for which very limited treatment is available. Inevitably,
patients with brain metastasis succumb to disease in a very short time. There is a strong resistance to the initial
development of brain metastasis, and the activation of astrocytes represents one of the earliest events observed
during the establishment of brain lesions. Their dual role first opposing and then favoring brain metastatic
progression has only started to be investigated. Treg cells colonize and expand in the inflamed brain tissue, and
have been shown to inhibit reactive gliosis in a model of stroke. We have demonstrated that Treg cell ablation
in early and late brain metastasis results in significant reduction of the brain tumor burden, and leads to extensive
expansion of reactive astrogliosis. In this research proposal, we use a combination of in vivo genetic modeling,
ex vivo brain organotypic slice cultures, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and single cell RNASequencing
to investigate the hypothesis that Treg cells promote the establishment and progression of brain metastasis by
modulating the highly heterogenous and plastic reactive astrocyte population. Results from the proposed studies
will illuminate the mechanisms of brain metastatic disease, and will provide novel opportunities based on a largely
unexplored therapeutic niche."
10838471,"Project Summary
The worldwide human population continually faces the challenge of seasonal influenza and other aggressive
respiratory virus infections. While the focus of research is usually on pulmonary manifestations, there is emerging
evidence that virus-induced “cytokine storm” as well as direct infection of cardiac tissue causes heart dysfunction
during influenza and other respiratory virus infections. A therapeutic approach that mitigates virus-induced
inflammation and restores cardiopulmonary integrity is urgently needed to treat virus-induced multi-organ
injuries. MG53 is a member of the TRIM protein family and plays an essential role in cell membrane repair. We
show previously that systemic administration of recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein protects against
injuries to the heart and lung in rodent and large animal models. Here we present new data that reveal a vital
role for MG53 in cardiopulmonary protection associated with virus infection. In addition to facilitating tissue repair,
MG53 also has an anti-inflammatory role in immunity. Human macrophages express MG53 and loss of MG53
leads to increased type I interferon and IL-6 production in virus infection due to hyperactivation of NF-κB. MG53
knockout mice infected with influenza virus display increased tissue inflammation and morbidity even though
virus titers are comparable to wild type mice. Intravenous administration of rhMG53 prevents death of wild type
mice subjected to a lethal influenza virus challenge, by reducing cytokine storm and preventing tissue damage
through inhibition of pyroptosis. These findings establish a new paradigm for treatment of infectious disease and
identify MG53 as a new target for control of virus-induced tissue injury. We hypothesize that the dual function of
MG53 in tissue-repair and limiting inflammation will combat cardiopulmonary injury caused by influenza virus.
We will dissect the roles of MG53 in preserving heart and lung function following influenza virus infection using
custom-generated MG53 loss of function and gain of function mouse models. We will elucidate the molecular
underpinnings and interplay between MG53 inhibition of both pyroptosis and NF-κB signaling as host-defense
mechanisms in the heart and lungs upon exposure to influenza virus. We will further establish the dosing and
timing strategies for administration of rhMG53 in mice to establish the prophylactic and therapeutic windows for
ameliorating virus-induced multi-organ failure. Since MG53 is not directly antiviral, potential exists for
combination therapy of rhMG53 with antivirals to effectively treat virus-induced cardiopulmonary injury. Thus, we
will quantify synergistic effects of treating influenza virus-infected mice with rhMG53 and FDA-approved anti-
influenza drugs on cardiac and lung viral titers, pathology, and function."

A key goal of evolutionary biology and human genetics is to understand the ways in
which natural selection has shaped genetic and phenotypic variation within and among
populations. The vast amount of population-genomic data, ancient DNA sequence data,
and genotype-phenotype mapping data being generated bring an unprecedented power
to address long-standing questions about the impact of adaptation in human evolution
and the role of migration and selection in driving genome-wide evolutionary change.
Our lab brings new tools from the intersection of population genetics and statistics to
address these questions, capitalizing on a range of new approaches, from building
genomic predictions of traits to the construction of genome-wide evolutionary
genealogies. To maximize the potential of these new data and approaches, we propose
to develop novel population-genomic models and statistical tools that address the roles
of natural selection and population structure in shaping population-genomic variation.
Specifically, the proposed work will: 1) Clarify how GWAS and population genetics can
be leveraged to both robustly identify signals of polygenic adaptation and problems with
confounding in GWAS; 2) Use genome-wide genealogies to estimate recent histories of
dispersal and selection; and 3) Estimate the proportion of allele-frequency change
driven by linked selection and the time scales over which selection acts, genome-wide.
The results of these projects will address fundamental questions about the structure of
human genomic variation."
10831049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eccrine glands are the major appendage of human skin and required for human thermoregulation. Despite their
importance, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of their development are poorly understood. This proposal
builds on our work implicating the transcription factor Engrailed-1 as a unique determinant and driver of eccrine
gland formation to define genetic and cellular mechanisms that induce the specification and differentiation of
eccrine sweat glands in the skin. Accordingly, the goals of this proposal are to identify the transcription factors
that directly modulate Engrailed1 expression during eccrine gland development (Aim1) and to define the
downstream Engrailed 1-dependent transcriptional program that then executes eccrine gland formation (Aim2).
This proposal integrates in vivo testing and high-throughput discovery of cellular and molecular components of
eccrine gland development using both newly generated and existing mouse models combined with mechanistic
dissection in cultured human skin cells and cross-validation between novel mouse and human single nucleus
transcriptomic datasets. As such, the proposed experiments will delineate the eccrine gland developmental
program, inform efforts to establish an in vitro system in which to study eccrine glands, and enhance
understanding of how ectodermal appendage fate and formation are established in the skin more broadly. From
a clinical perspective, our findings will provide a molecular blueprint for future studies to regenerate eccrine
glands in vivo and also offer novel points of intervention for repair of eccrine glands when these organs are
pathologically altered or damaged."
10859896,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance is a major threat to global health, with only about a third of the half million
drug-resistant TB patients enrolled into treatment, highlighting a critical gap for diagnosing drug resistant TB. To
address this challenge, investigators from Princeton, Rutgers, Fudan, and Harvard University have convened
clinical, technologic, laboratory and epidemiologic expertise to develop and evaluate a new platform to address
critical unmet TB drug susceptibility testing needs. To improve accuracy and comprehensiveness within rapid,
simplified workflows for TB drug susceptibility testing, we will leverage a highly-multiplexed CRISPR platform
called CARMEN. Our project benefits from optimization of CARMEN over the last 4 years for viral, bacterial, and
single nucleotide polymorphism-based variant and drug resistance detection, machine-learning based design
strategies, and ongoing advancements in simplified workflows. The project further benefits from a large bank of
MDR-TB strains and sputum samples for assay optimization and validation and a team with complementary
expertise in molecular TB drug resistance, technology development and validation, and clinical implementation.
This proposal will test the hypothesis that a TB DST based on the CARMEN platform will meet or exceed minimal
WHO performance and operational targets for high-priority first and second line drugs. Specific aims are to
develop a comprehensive CRISPR-based TB drug susceptibility test to achieve accurate genotypic and
phenotypic predictions for: (1) resistance to high-priority first-line drugs, (2) resistance to high-priority second
line drugs, and 3) to further simplify the manual workflow, speed, and instrumentation to exceed operational
criteria for use in peripheral laboratories."
10859370,"SUMMARY
Insulin is a pancreatic peptide hormone that is of critical importance for glucose homeostasis. Disruption
of insulin production or function can result in diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy is the only effective treatment
for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is used by many people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and some individuals
with gestational diabetes (GDM). Despite major advances in insulin therapy, achieving efficient glycemic
control to prevent short- and long-term complications remains a major challenge in diabetes management.
This is in part due to the fact that insulin and its current therapeutic analogs self-associate into dimers and
hexamers that form subcutaneous depots, which delays their onset of action and leads to prolonged
duration of action. Our recent discovery of specialized monomeric insulins from the venom of fish-hunting
cone snails that rapidly lower blood glucose in animal models of diabetes provides the unique opportunity
to address these persistent limitations of current diabetes therapeutics. Furthermore, shaped by millions
of years of predator-prey evolution, venom insulins have evolved unique ways of engaging with the
vertebrate insulin receptor (hIR), thus providing a unique toolset to study diverse molecular modes of hIR
activation. Proof of concept for the high translational impact of this proposal is provided by Con-Insulin
G1, our first discovered venom insulins that revealed the existence of a minimized insulin binding motif at
the hIR and has already led to the design of a new therapeutic prandial insulin candidate. Our recent
preliminary data demonstrates that Con-Ins G1 is only one of > 20 diverse insulins evolved by fish-hunting
cone snails. We hypothesize that each one of these insulins represents a novel scaffold for the rational
design of improved insulin therapeutics. The aim of this proposal is to survey the entire chemical diversity
of naturally evolved insulin analogs (so-called evologs) for the discovery and development of new insulin
drug candidates with advantageous properties over existing analogs (i.e., improved stability profiles, faster
onset of action, reduced rates of post-injection hypoglycemia, and potentially improved metabolic
signaling). We anticipate that these candidates have the potential to significantly improve diabetes therapy
and enhance the performance of closed-loop systems in the future."
10850326,"In this application, we propose to acquire the first commercial optical tweezers-single molecule super-resolution
fluorescence microscope and house it in an open-access, shared-use facility at the University of Michigan (U-M)
to serve a broad user base at the U-M and beyond. The proposed LUMICKS C-Trap Dymo will be placed into
the well-established Single Molecule Analysis in Real-Time (SMART) instrumentation Center to make it available
to the entire biomedical research communities of the U-M, Michigan State University, Oakland University, and
the Van Andel Institute across the state of Michigan. The C-Trap will advance a significant number of current

folding and function to the role of phase separation in disease, from biophysics to cell biology. New users will
be trained and guided in their research by the highly experienced SMART Center Manager Dr. Damon Hoff, who
earned his PhD on optical tweezers as applied to biomedical problems. The SMART Center has existed since
2010, has a well-practiced intake, training and affordable recharge system, leverages university support as a
Core facility of the Center for RNA Biomedicine, and already serves a broad biomedical research community at
Michigan. If funded, the C-Trap will complement existing single molecule instrumentation at SMART and expand
the Center's reach, enticing researchers at the U-M and other institutions to utilize the combined optical tweezers-

fluorescence microscopy, Comstock is an expert in optical tweezers combined with single molecule fluorescence
observation. Comstock's expertise in particular will be leveraged to help guide the research on the C-Trap and
subsequent data analysis in the most productive scientific directions. An Advisory Committee of complementary
biomedical experts will regularly meet to help optimize use of the C-Trap and further ensure scientific rigor and
significance, assisting Walter and Comstock in this task. The proposed state-of-the-art C-Trap is equipped with
quadruple laser tweezers, a three-wavelength, single-photon-sensitivity laser scanning confocal fluorescence
microscope, and stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution fluorescence capability (i.e., a STED
nanoscope), thereby accommodating the broadest range of research. In addition to best-in-class force sensitivity
and imaging capabilities, the proposed C-Trap offers a most user-friendly software and experimental workflow
among optical trapping systems, allowing novice users to quickly perform sophisticated experiments.
Successfully establishing the C-Trap in the SMART Center is expected to advance the goals of 7 Major and 10
Minor, robustly NIH-funded Users, spanning many departments and schools across the U-M and state of
Michigan. Overall, the C-Trap will lead to high-impact publications in top tier journals, more competitive
proposals for extramural funding, and better training of the next generation of single-molecule experimentalists."
10852821,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow obstruction, increased mucus
production, and predisposition to recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. It affects ~5% of the US
population, ranking third as a cause of mortality. This high prevalence and disease chronicity results in
frequent hospitalizations, and need for lifelong therapies. In spite of this high disease burden, there have been
no new FDA approved therapies in the past two decades. Chronic cigarette smoke exposure, the commonest
cause of COPD, leads to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased mitochondrial
ability to handle these ROS, and cell death, with the latter leading to breakdown of alveolar surfaces, blebbing,
and decreased pulmonary surface for adequate oxygen exchange. Cilia are tubulin-containing hair-like
projections on the cell surface of epithelial cells lining the tracheobronchial tree that beat in a coordinated,
metachronal wave to sweep inhaled pollutants and pathogens away from the lungs. In COPD, these cilia are
sparse, stunted, and beat with lower frequencies than in healthy lungs leading to poor mucociliary clearance
(MCC) and recurrent infections. Mitochondrial dysfunction due to overwhelming ROS production is also
associated with defective cilia formation. Our prior work led to identification of a 12-amino acid peptide that we
termed Cardiac Targeting Peptide due to its ability to transduce normal mouse heart tissue after peripheral
injection. An alanine scan with sequential, single alanine substitutions led to the discovery of two alanine
mutants (S7A and R11A with serine at position 7 and arginine at position 11 substituted with alanine) that
instead of the heart robustly transduced lung epithelial tissue after a peripheral injection. A key player in
ciliogenesis is Notch, a transcription factor that determines pluripotent Club cell fate and differentiation into
mucus producing goblet cells at the expense of multi-ciliated cells. We have shown that treatment of reciliating
mouse tracheal and human nasal epithelial cell cultures with 2nM DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-
alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester), a small molecule Notch inhibitor, led to significant increase in degree of
ciliogenesis, cilia length, and ciliary beat frequency compared to controls. In this grant, we are proposing to
develop these novel lung targeting peptides as vectors to deliver a number of different ROS scavengers
(Szeto-Schiller peptide, Mitotempo, reduced glutathione) to lungs of mice with smoke-induced COPD. We are
also proposing to utilize DAPT in vivo in these mice to improve ciliary function with the ultimate goal of
improving MCC. Our overarching goal is to target novel pathophysiological pathways in COPD by enhancing
mitochondrial function and ciliogenesis to improve MCC."

The accumulation of mutant myocillin leads to decreased aqueous humor outflow and results in ER
dysfunction. Grp94 is a major chaperone localized to the ER that is responsible for modulating ER stress and
the folding of select client proteins to maintain proteostasis. Through a number of key studies, it has been
shown that Grp94 attempts to fold mutant myocillin, but instead co-aggregates and creates a toxic gain of
function for Grp94 that results in POAG. Recently, we discovered Grp94 selective inhibitors and demonstrated
both in vitro and in vivo that they reduced aggregation and restore intraocular pressure, providing a new
mechanism for the treatment of POAG. Therefore, we propose in this application to optimize our lead
compounds, determine their mechanism of action, and provide additional data to support their development as
topically administered therapeutics not only for POAG, but also steroid-induced glaucoma."

Among individuals who survive ≥5 years from a cancer diagnosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading
cause of death. Black adults with cancer have twice the risk of poor CVD outcomes as White adults with
cancer. This disparity is partially due to a higher CVD prevalence among Blacks in the general population, and
greater incidence of cardio-toxic effects from cancer therapies among Blacks, but we hypothesize that social
determinants of health (SDOHs) (e.g., area-level structural racism and individual socio-economic position) are
also responsible for Black-White CVD disparities. We have shown that having ≥1 adverse SDOH increases
one’s risk of cancer mortality, and Blacks are more likely to have ≥2 SDOHs than Whites (44% vs. 24%). Apart
from cancer, ≥1 SDOHs increases one’s risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. Underlying
mechanisms of SDOHs that lead to CVD disparities in cancer survivors are not well understood. Structural
racism has policy implications and understanding its role in Black-White CVD disparities can point the way to
solutions to reduce disparities. We will use the World Health Organization’s Commission on SDOH framework
to investigate relationships between SDOHs and CVD outcomes in Black and White cancer survivors.
The objective of this proposal is to determine the role of SDOH (structural racism and individual socio-
economic position) on CVD outcomes among a community-based cohort of 8,000 male and female adults with
cancer. We seek to leverage a novel link between data from the REasons for Geographic And Racial
Disparities in Stroke (REGARDS) study to cancer registries from the Virtual Pooled Registry Cancer Linkage
System (VPR-CLS). REGARDS is a national, prospective, longitudinal cohort study that recruited 30,239
English-speaking individuals, at least 45 years of age from the 48 contiguous US states (42% Black; 55%
female) in 2003-7 and follows participants today. The VPR, coordinated by the North American Association of
Cancer Registries, includes 45 registries covering 95% of the U.S. The novel combination of data sources will
leverage area-level structural racism measures and individual-level measures of socio-economic status, cancer
biologic factors, health behaviors, self-rated health, and expert adjudicated CVD outcomes to determine
among cancer survivors: 1) associations between SDOH and CVD outcomes; 2) the role of cancer biologic,
behavioral, and psychosocial factors in the relationship between SDOH and CVD; and 3) the role of cancer
and non-cancer health service use in the relationship between SDOH and CVD. Our long-term goal is to
develop strategies to eliminate White-Black disparities in CVD outcomes in cancer survivors. We have
assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts in CVD and cancer epidemiology, health services research,
cardio-oncology, biostatistics, SDOH, and structural racism. Together, we will generate evidence to inform and
develop interventions to eliminate Black-White CVD disparities in cancer survivorship."

Myelination facilitates rapid axonal conduction, enabling efficient communication across different parts of the
nervous system. Demyelination associated with CNS trauma or diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and
glaucoma contributes significantly to behavioral deficits. Despite tremendous progress in understanding
regulatory mechanisms of myelination, there are no pro-myelination treatments in the clinical setting. In our
recent studies, using optic nerve/tract injury models, we discovered that injured axons could regenerate
following intervention to elevate the regenerative ability of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), yet these regenerated
axons fail to be myelinated. Further, we showed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) do proliferate
but fail to differentiate and mature into myelinating oligodendrocytes in response to ONC. With these unique
models, we further demonstrated that blockade of muscarinic receptor 1 (M1R, or Chrm1) or GPR17 promoted
OPC differentiation while depleting activated microglia facilitated the maturation or survival of newly formed
oligodendrocytes. Thus, at least two overarching mechanisms contribute to the observed myelination failure:
OPC intrinsic mechanisms preventing OPC differentiation, and microglia-relevant factors inhibiting the
formation of mature oligodendrocytes by unknown mechanism(s). Importantly, treatments acting on these
mechanisms promoted de novo myelination of regenerated axons and point to potential translatable pro-
myelination strategies. In this application, following up with these initial findings, we will investigate the
following questions: how do M1R and GPR17 regulate OPC differentiation? Do they work within the same
signaling pathway(s)? How do activated microglia affect oligodendrocytes? Does treatment-induced de novo
myelination improve behavioral outcome(s)? We expect that our studies will inform the mechanisms and
therapeutic potential of myelination regeneration and visual restoration."

The ability of the heart to contract continuously is vital to the organism and is dictated in part by the sarcomeres,
the functional units of the contractile apparatus. Consequently, any errors in the formation, composition or
homeostasis of the sarcomere structure lead to congenital heart defects (CHD) or various forms of
cardiomyopathy. While the highly complex structure of the cardiac sarcomere and its function have been studied
extensively for decades, comparatively little remains known about how the sarcomere structure is established in
the first place, during de novo sarcomerogenesis. Current knowledge is largely qualitative as in depth
mechanistic studies are challenging at such early stages of development. Here we will use human pluripotent
stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) to interrogate our hypothesis that de novo sarcomerogenesis
occurs via a mode of assembly that involves formation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs) with distinct
biophysical properties. In Aim 1 we will interrogate the biophysical properties of Z-bodies and Z-discs during
early heart development and identify individual candidates and biological processes that dictate Z-body formation.
We will use super-resolution and time-lapse microscopy, FRAP analysis and transmission electron microscopy.
To identify drivers of Z-body formation we will use CRISPRi for candidates identified in the ACTN2 interactome
and likely to be involved in formation of MLOs. Lastly, we will assess if Z-bodies possess distinct biochemical
functions, including the presence of specific mRNA transcrips and/or local translational activity. In Aim 2 we will
determine the mechanisms that underlie Z-body initiation at the onset of de novo sarcomerogenesis. We have
described a role for WNT and RHO signaling in Z-body formation and we will identify additional mechanisms
using small molecule screening. The successful completion of this comprehensive and detailed mechanistic
study of Z-bodies holds the promise of delivering an unprecedented level of characterization of this critical stage
of de novo sarcomerogenesis. It will encompass a thorough understanding of the formation and function of Z-
bodies as a biomolecular condensates, as well as the identification of novel candidates involved in this process
and their role in cardiac function."
10859614,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor, is the most aggressive diffuse
glioma of the astrocytic lineage. Despite recent advances in multimodality therapy for GBM incorporating
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and supportive care, the overall prognosis remains poor, and long-term
survival is rare. Immunotherapy has the potential to harness the immune system to kill brain tumor cells;
however, the outcome of ongoing clinical trials with immunotherapies for GBM has been unsatisfactory. The
highly immunosuppressive nature of GBM represents a key resistance mechanism to immunotherapy as
glioma cells escape effective antitumor immunity by programming the tumor microenvironment (TME). The
inability of immune-based therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents another roadblock to the
success of immunotherapy in the treatment of GBM. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the development of
immunomodulators of the GBM TME that can cross the BBB. Chitinase-3 like-protein-1 (CHI3L1) is a key
mediator of an immunosuppressive GBM microenvironment by reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs). The binding of CHI3L1 to galectin-3 (Gal-3) selectively promotes TAM migration and infiltration with a
protumor M2-like, but not an antitumor M1-like, phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Silencing CHI3L1 in syngeneic
GBM mouse models results in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor size reduction, and
improved animal survival, which is reversed by the overexpression of CHI3L1. However, there are no drug
candidates in existence that can block the immunosuppressive function of CHI3L1 in GBM. We aim to
establish a new immunotherapeutic strategy for GBM based on targeting CHI3L1/Gal-3 interaction with small
molecules, which may synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors to effectively promote tumor regression for
GBM patients. We hypothesize that small molecule-based blockade of CHI3L1/Gal-3 will reverse immune
suppression and attenuate tumor progression in preclinical models of GBM. Our hybrid expertise in the
development of small molecule immunomodulators, hit-to-lead optimization, translational drug discovery
research, and immunopharmacology uniquely positions us to achieve this goal. We propose to perform
optimization studies of a small molecule inhibitor of CHI3L1/Gal-3 interaction to develop optimized leads with
single-digit nanomolar potency in cell-based assays (Aim 1). Subsequently, we will perform in vitro and in vivo
pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of the optimized leads in order to select the top three lead compounds for
further assessment of their therapeutic potential using two mouse models of GBM (Aim 2). The proximal
expected outcome of this work is the introduction of clinically translatable small molecule inhibitors of
CHI3L1/Gal-3 interaction that can be further implemented in combination therapy approaches to overcome the
immunosuppressive nature of GBM."

Influenza A virus (IAV) constitutes an ongoing threat to global health. IAV infection is especially problematic
in aged individuals, with estimated close to 90% IAV-associated deaths occurring in the elderly. Alveolar
macrophages (AMs) are the primary lung macrophage population that are important in lung homeostasis,
anti-viral immunity and tissue recovery. AMs exhibit stem-like features of self-renewal, but also can rapidly
produce pro-inflammatory mediators upon stimulation, which could potentially contribute to pulmonary
inflammation and injury during IAV infection. Little is known currently about the mechanisms modulating AM
proliferative and inflammatory fate decisions in vivo, and the subsequent effects on tissue inflammation and
recovery following IAV infection. In this application, we hypothesize that the interplay of b-catenin, HIF1-a
and TCF-4 modulates AM self-renewal and inflammatory activity, thereby regulating pulmonary
inflammation and tissue repair during IAV infection. Furthermore, we hypothesize that exaggerated b-
catenin-HIF1-a expression dictates the aging-associated defects in AM self-renewal and function, thereby
leading to severe pulmonary diseases and/or defective lung repair following IAV infection in aged hosts.
Three specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1: To elucidate the associated-mechanisms by which b-
catenin/HIF1-a complex modulates AM inflammatory activity and self-renewal, and subsequent effects on
host diseases and recovery from IAV infection. Aim 2: To define the underlying mechanisms by which TCF-
4 regulates AM development, self-renewal and/or inflammation during homeostasis and following IAV
infection. Aim 3: To determine the roles of dysregulated AM b-catenin/HIF1-a axis in contributing to aging-
associated defects in AM function and regeneration, thereby causing severe IAV-associated diseases in
aged hosts."

 The long-term goal of this research is to improve patient safety by establishing simulator training and
evaluation of surgical skills as essential components of orthopedic residency programs. Many orthopaedic
surgeries involve the challenging integration of fluoroscopic image and video interpretation with skillful tool
manipulation to achieve well-defined objectives. Simulation has proved beneficial in this context for surgical
trainees, but programs have been slow to embrace this advance, and methods for evaluating operating
room (OR) performance of these skills to document improvement have been lacking. Objectively measuring
skill in the OR is a critical step toward this goal because it allows skills training to be linked to performance
in surgery. This is an important missed opportunity. The proposed research will advance objective
measurement techniques that are critically needed to speed improvement in resident performance on
technical skills, ultimately reducing costs while enhancing patient safety. The long-term goal will be
achieved by partnering with the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) to more tightly integrate
surgical skills training and simulation into pre-certification policies. For this reason, researchers at the
University of Iowa are leveraging the skills and experience of existing ABOS grant-funded research groups
at the University of Rochester and the University of Texas Health in Houston to pursue this goal.
 The proposed research approach is based on our multi-institution simulation studies with novel surgical
simulators and on our previous, AHRQ-funded, ground-breaking analysis techniques for assessing task-
specific, detailed, OR performance. Our central hypothesis is that orthopedic surgical skill competence can
be objectively, quantitatively, and reliably measured from behaviors observable in fluoroscopy and video
routinely collected in the OR. Our research team is well poised for this work; our core multi-disciplinary team
of engineers, surgeons, psychometricians have collaborated for nearly a decade to improve orthopedic
residency training. Our team is now partnered with the ABOS to advance simulation as a tool for training
orthopaedic residents and assessing performance prior to qualifying for certification. Aim 1 of the proposed
research is to measure differences in resident OR performance from objective analysis of surgical imagery,
and speed up these measurements. Aim 2 is to determine how differences in simulator training correlate
with skills demonstrated in the OR, and use this information to improve training programs. Aim 3 is to
identify individual differences in skills among residents, both in the skills lab and in the OR, and use this
knowledge to improve individual training. This research is innovative because it demonstrates and
disseminates new skill assessment techniques critically needed to hasten improvement in orthopedic
resident performance, ultimately reducing costs while enhancing patient safety."

Advances in computational and experimental protein engineering have ushered in a new era of biomolecule
development, providing new functional binding proteins, improved enzymes, and rationally designed synthetic
receptors. Despite such progress, established techniques lack the ability to develop and study synthetic receptors
and inhibitory molecules in high throughput, instead relying on rational or function-agnostic engineering
approaches followed by low-throughput characterization for the desired activity. This deficiency in approach
results in 1) the development of suboptimal candidate proteins and 2) a costly development process.
My long-term goals are to 1) establish new platforms that incorporate protein function as a selective pressure
to engineer new molecules and 2) utilize these new platforms to understand the roles of natural and synthetic
proteins in cell signaling responses in both normal and disease pathologies. I hypothesize that the
incorporation of protein function as a selective pressure in protein engineering campaigns will result in the
efficient development of new classes of functional proteins capable of answering key biological questions. The
goals during this proposal period are to establish high-throughput screening platforms for inhibitor
engineering and for synthetic receptor engineering, as well as develop combined computational and
experimental protein engineering pipelines to aid the study of important proteins. Continued work in the
described areas has immense potential to aid the study of basic and synthetic biology through 1) greatly
expanding the availability of molecules to empower studies of the importance of individual molecules in cell
signaling responses, 2) providing a new toolkit for understanding synthetic receptor function, and 3) providing
modular platforms to aid discovery of functional engineered molecules. We will pursue three primary directions:
Direction 1: Establish a tethered inhibitor engineering platform with yeast surface display.
Current directed evolution approaches often lack protein function as a selective pressure, resulting in majority
development of passive binding proteins. We will incorporate the concept of tethering from the small molecule
screening community to drive yeast-displayed protein selection toward active inhibition.
Direction 2. Establish combined computational and experimental protein engineering pipelines.
Current protein engineering approaches typically rely on widespread mutagenesis or in-depth
computational/rational design to develop functional proteins. We will incorporate accessible computational
approaches for protein mutant library design and investigate these approaches for basic mutational studies.
Direction 3. Establish a high-throughput platform for studying synthetic receptors. Synthetic
receptors have made measurable impacts in both basic and clinical science, but no effective platform exists to
study their development in high throughput. We will establish a high-throughput screening platform with
proliferation from receptor functions as a selective pressure for engineering new synthetic receptors."

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the large intestine with a rising global incidence.
MC primarily affects older adults, in whom it accounts for a significant proportion of cases of chronic diarrhea
and fecal incontinence. The growing burden of the disease is primarily thought to be related to its increased
recognition, an aging population and polypharmacy. Yet, the exact etiology remains largely unknown. This
proposal will expand upon emerging evidence from our group and others that medications such as proton pump
inhibitors (PPIs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and exogenous hormone use are associated
with increased risk of MC and that among patients with chronic diarrhea, the gut microbiota in active MC is
characterized by dysbiosis and unique compositional and functional changes. Our central hypothesis is that the
pathogenesis of MC is, at least in part, related to pharmacologic-induced perturbations in the aging gut
microbiota. To test this hypothesis, we have assembled the first nationwide gastrointestinal histopathology
cohort, with a validated definition for MC (n = 14,000) and over 20 years of follow up as well as a highly-
phenotyped colonoscopy-based cohort (n = 1600) with detailed questionnaires and biobanking of blood and stool
samples. Our specific aims include: 1) identification of key pharmacologic determinants of MC (Aim 1); 2)
identifying novel microbial signatures of MC in older adults with chronic diarrhea (Aim 2); 3) characterizing the
structure and function of the gut microbiota according to MC disease activity (Aim 2); 4) identifying microbial
communities and metabolites that mediate the relationship between medication-related risk factors and MC (Aim
3). The proposed work will have significant clinical and mechanistic implications. First, current guidelines
recommend discontinuing “potential” pharmacologic triggers as an adjunct therapy, particularly in recurrent or
refractory disease. However, as this approach may lead to unnecessary discontinuation of important medications
such as antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, that have been linked to MC in some studies, findings from
our high quality pharmacoepidemiologic studies could directly inform clinical guidelines. Second, the results of
our microbiome studies could provide valuable data on use of gut microbiota signatures as a non-invasive
biomarker for diagnosing MC in older adults with chronic diarrhea. Lastly, the proposed work is significant as it
enhances our fundamental understanding of the relationship between commonly prescribed medications, the
aging gut microbiota, and gut inflammation in older adults. The proposal is innovative in its assembly of high-
level multidisciplinary team with complementary set of expertise and use of start-of-the-art computational
methods to characterize the relationship between medications and the gut microbiota in MC. Given the aging
U.S. population, the growing incidence of MC and the lack of FDA-approved medical treatments for patients with
established disease, this proposal addresses an area of great unmet need in aging research and is a topic of
high priority for the current grant announcement (PA-18-738)."

Environmental perturbations that occur during early postnatal life, such as exposure to maternal high fat diet during lactation (MHFD), may alter how interosensory signals are centrally processed and transmitted in adulthood, leading to dysregulation of feeding behavior. Although MHFD is known to alter feeding behavior in offspring, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain largely unexplored. The overarching premise for the proposed studies is that, MHFD exposure causes significant changes in the organization and activity of neural pathways conveying convergent interoceptive information to key components of neural circuits known to regulate feeding behavior. Because the architecture of neural pathways transmitting interosensory information is a state defining feature of how the brain integrates interoceptive sensation, understanding how MHFD impacts quantitative changes in the input/output structure and activity of these circuits will provide mechanistic insight into developmental programming of metabolic phenotype. Viscerosensory information is transmitted centrally by the vagus nerve to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), which contains neurons known to convey regulatory signals to the hypothalamus, as well as to other brain regions involved in the control of feeding. Similarly, circulating levels of leptin signal the state of systemic energy stores and regulate neurons in multiple brain regions. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) contains AgRP neurons, which play a key role in the regulation of feeding and distribute leptin and other metabolic signals to downstream components of feeding circuitry, such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH). In contrast, the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) shares strong connections with cerebral cortex and plays a key role in consummatory aspects of feeding. For the proposed studies, tissue clearing and light sheet fluorescence imaging will be used to label, image and register the brain-wide distributions of neurons that provide inputs to the ARH, PVH and LHA in order to test the hypothesis that MHFD exposure causes permanent changes in the multiregional convergence of projections to distinct components of feeding circuitry. (Specific Aim 1). Calcium-based microendoscopy will be used to determine how MHFD impacts the ensemble activity of neurons in the PVH, and LHA, within the context of feeding behavior (Specific Aim 2). Together, the studies proposed in this 3-year project will identify neural substrates that integrate diverse metabolic signals required for coordinated control of feeding behavior, as well as contribute to our understanding of the developmental neurobiology of metabolic programming."

Project Abstract
Delaware PRAMS 2021 Project Summary/Abstract PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System) is a federally funded, state- specific, population-based
surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected maternal behaviors and
experiences before, during, and after pregnancy. The purpose of the project is to enable
public health programs to target specific maternal and child health populations for
improved health outcomes. For children this would be a reduction in infant morbidity and
mortality rates, which for Delaware are above the national average. States have used
the PRAMS surveillance data for program planning and evaluation, and changing public
health practice and public health policy for state maternal and child health programs.
The high quality of the PRAMS data enables states to more efficiently develop and
evaluate existing programs such as Newborn Screening, SUID awareness, and the
Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (Title V). PRAMS also provides a system to
monitor the state’s progress towards achieving the Healthy People 2020 goal of
reducing infant and maternal morbidities and mortality. The PRAMS project funds
implementation of a state-wide surveillance system of women of childbearing age.
Surveillance includes analysis of women’s behaviors, practices, and experiences during
pregnancy, childbirth, and two to six months post-partum. A random, stratified sample of
women at least two months post-partum is selected annually for inclusion in the project.
The sampled participants are surveyed to assess behaviors, practices, and
experiences. Descriptive and analytic statistics will provide information on the highest
risk populations in the state, including minorities and women who deliver a low birth
weight baby. Focusing on these groups will enable DPH to better target existing
programs in Maternal and Child Health. Targeting programs at high-risk populations will
impact the rate of morbidity and mortality among women and infants born in the state."

The long-term objective of this project is to understand how vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) adapt
during bloodstream infection (BSI) to better tolerate antibiotic and host immune defenses. Enterococci have
evolved over hundreds of millions of years to colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals, and they are well
adapted to reside there. VRE causing BSI, however, face substantially different selective pressures, such as
antibiotics in high concentrations, nutrient restriction, and host immune defenses. At our center over the past five
years, patients with VRE-BSIs had a 30-day mortality rate of 36%, which was higher than BSIs due to all other
ESKAPE pathogens. Additionally, VRE-BSIs are often difficult to treat, and nearly one third of patients with VRE-
BSI experience either prolonged bacteremia (≥5 days), or recurrent infection within one year. Here we propose
to study the population-level evolutionary dynamics of VRE sampled from the GI tract and blood of patients with
VRE-BSI, and to characterize bacterial adaptations that promote VRE-BSI. Our central hypothesis is that VRE
isolated from BSIs possess genetic adaptations that enable them to survive in the blood environment. In Aim 1,
we will use bacterial population-level whole genome sequencing to identify genetic adaptations associated with
VRE-BSI. We propose to collect matched samples from VRE GI tract surveillance specimens and VRE-BSI from
approximately 150 patients, and to sequence them deeply to assess the diversity of the VRE population at each
body site. We will also compare VRE-BSI populations collected over time from patients that have persistent or
recurrent VRE-BSI. We will utilize comparative genomics and selection-based analyses to identify bacterial loci
that are candidate targets for selection. In Aim 2, we will quantify the effect of mutations in VRE transcription and
translation genes on antibiotic resistance and tolerance. We have already identified candidate adaptive
mutations in RNA polymerase subunits, ribosomal proteins, a ribosome methyltransferase, and several
transcriptional regulators. We will investigate: 1) The connection between antibiotic exposure and the occurrence
of these mutations in the GI tract and blood of VRE-BSI patients, 2) The effects of these mutations on VRE
transcription and translation, and 3) The contribution of these mutations to resistance and/or tolerance of
antibiotics used to treat VRE-BSI. In Aim 3, we will determine whether mutations in the capsular polysaccharide
(cps) and enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (epa) biosynthetic loci augment VRE growth and survival during
BSI. We will investigate the impact of mutations that alter these cell surface-associated polysaccharides on VRE
survival in whole human blood, in the presence of human neutrophils, as well as in a mouse model of VRE
infection. Overall, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of how antibiotic-resistant bacteria
adapt during human infection. In addition, the identification of bacterial genes and pathways under selection
during VRE-BSI will lay the foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies that target antibiotic-resistant
Gram-positive infections, which have high mortality and place a large burden on healthcare systems."

evolved over hundreds of millions of years to colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals, and they are well
adapted to reside there. VRE causing BSI, however, face substantially different selective pressures, such as
antibiotics in high concentrations, nutrient restriction, and host immune defenses. At our center over the past five
years, patients with VRE-BSIs had a 30-day mortality rate of 36%, which was higher than BSIs due to all other
ESKAPE pathogens. Additionally, VRE-BSIs are often difficult to treat, and nearly one third of patients with VRE-
BSI experience either prolonged bacteremia (≥5 days), or recurrent infection within one year. Here we propose
to study the population-level evolutionary dynamics of VRE sampled from the GI tract and blood of patients with
VRE-BSI, and to characterize bacterial adaptations that promote VRE-BSI. Our central hypothesis is that VRE
isolated from BSIs possess genetic adaptations that enable them to survive in the blood environment. In Aim 1,
we will use bacterial population-level whole genome sequencing to identify genetic adaptations associated with
VRE-BSI. We propose to collect matched samples from VRE GI tract surveillance specimens and VRE-BSI from
approximately 150 patients, and to sequence them deeply to assess the diversity of the VRE population at each
body site. We will also compare VRE-BSI populations collected over time from patients that have persistent or
recurrent VRE-BSI. We will utilize comparative genomics and selection-based analyses to identify bacterial loci
that are candidate targets for selection. In Aim 2, we will quantify the effect of mutations in VRE transcription and
translation genes on antibiotic resistance and tolerance. We have already identified candidate adaptive
mutations in RNA polymerase subunits, ribosomal proteins, a ribosome methyltransferase, and several
transcriptional regulators. We will investigate: 1) The connection between antibiotic exposure and the occurrence
of these mutations in the GI tract and blood of VRE-BSI patients, 2) The effects of these mutations on VRE
transcription and translation, and 3) The contribution of these mutations to resistance and/or tolerance of
antibiotics used to treat VRE-BSI. In Aim 3, we will determine whether mutations in the capsular polysaccharide
(cps) and enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (epa) biosynthetic loci augment VRE growth and survival during
BSI. We will investigate the impact of mutations that alter these cell surface-associated polysaccharides on VRE
survival in whole human blood, in the presence of human neutrophils, as well as in a mouse model of VRE
infection. Overall, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of how antibiotic-resistant bacteria
adapt during human infection. In addition, the identification of bacterial genes and pathways under selection
during VRE-BSI will lay the foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies that target antibiotic-resistant
Gram-positive infections, which have high mortality and place a large burden on healthcare systems."
10840519,"ABSTRACT:
Since 2000, the PI has been awarded continuous NIH funding to contribute to the RNA field by building a broad
research portfolio focused on dissecting the mechanisms of the nanoscale RNA machines of gene expression –
ranging from small ribozymes and riboswitches to the RNA silencing machinery – by single molecule
fluorescence microscopy. Building on this expertise, the two long-term goals of the current MIRA renewal
proposal are to: 1.) Apply our established mechanistic enzymology approaches to an ever broader set of RNAs
involved in regulating mRNA transcription and translation, while seizing opportunities arising from the continuing
discoveries of new RNA functions. 2.) Push the technical limits of our approaches to be able to probe
increasingly complex biological machineries and mechanisms since unexpected discoveries – as we found –
often await where RNA nanomachines interact. In pursuit of these goals, we will address the overarching
hypothesis that both secondary and tertiary structures of RNA determine the outcomes of gene expression, in
often enigmatic and poorly understood ways that were traditionally overlooked by a field rooted in genetics,
where genes to this day often are drawn as sequence strings without structural features. Such thinking is
countered by, for example, the fact that nascent RNA structures have a significant impact on transcription in the
form of regulatory riboswitches embedded near the 5' ends of bacterial mRNAs that respond to specific ligands
by forming transcription terminator hairpins. In addition, the time-ordered, 5'-to-3' directional RNA synthesis
during transcription often yields kinetically trapped RNA folds distinct from the most thermodynamically stable
structure of a refolded full-length transcript. Encapsulating the power of our pursuit, we are combining our
signature single-molecule, biochemical and computational approaches to show that bacterial transcription
pausing frequently occurs at sites immediately downstream of both transcriptional and translational riboswitches,
which allows riboswitch ligands to affect transcription and transcription-translation coupling, respectively. In
addition, we are interrogating the mechanism of mammalian RNA silencing using single particle tracking both in
cultured human cells and reconstituted in human cell extracts. We posit that our work will continue to discover
more examples of intimate structural and kinetic coupling between RNA folding and gene expression, leading to
the exquisite gene regulation underlying all life processes. Ultimately, we anticipate that our studies have the
potential to transform our understanding of RNA structure-function relationships in general, and of how RNA
secondary and tertiary structure is governing the function of cellular gene expression machines in particular."
10840530,"Project Summary: The value of chemical synthesis in health-related research is closely tied to the ability to
efficiently generate medicinal agents from readily available materials. This MIRA application seeks to continue
our efforts centered on the development of innovative synthetic transformations of fundamental building blocks.
The long-term goal of this program is to identify promising new modes of chemical reactivity that facilitate the
rapid discovery and development of small molecules for biomedical applications. The overall objective of this
application is to develop a diverse set of enabling transformations featuring widely available synthetic
feedstocks. Site-selective transformations of aliphatic C–H bonds hold enormous promise in streamlining drug
synthesis and expediting access to novel analogs of biologically relevant compounds via late-stage
functionalization. Despite this potential, synthetic capabilities remain limited to a narrow subset of possible C–H
transformations. Moreover, site- and chemoselective derivatization of the functional group rich substrates most
relevant to drug development remains a challenge. We seek to develop intermolecular aliphatic C–H
functionalizations that open access to new chemical space with drug-like substrates and proceed with high
levels of reagent-dictated site selectivity. This research is based on the hypothesis that radical-chain,
intermolecular C–H functionalizations using tuned heteroatom-centered radicals can proceed with exceptional
levels of efficiency and selectivity on complex, medicinally relevant substrates, enabling otherwise inaccessible
C–H transformations. Our approach will leverage the reactivity of tuned heteroatom-centered radicals with a
range of unique coupling partners to achieve new site- and chemoselective transformations.
 Another major goal is to develop new catalytic platforms of earth-abundant metals that enable valuable
transformations of diverse synthetic feedstocks. Hydrocarbonylations of alkenes have demonstrated utility in
the synthesis of medicinally relevant compounds, yet many attractive transformations remain inaccessible
owing to limitations in catalysis. The development of catalytic C–C bond constructions that use easily-accessed
alkyl electrophiles is another major challenge. We seek to establish new reactivity manifolds in earth-abundant
metal catalysis which we hypothesize will enable solutions to these challenges. Our objectives include the
development of both new hydrocarbonylations of alkenes that feature a range of common nucleophiles and
catalytic C–C bond-forming couplings of unactivated alkyl chlorides. The rationale of the proposed research is
that the practical and selective reactions produced will facilitate access to diverse synthetically and medicinally
valuable small molecules. Our proposed research is innovative because it develops several new modes of
chemical reactivity to generate new, powerful bond-forming reactions. These contributions are significant
because they will offer a range of transformations for the discovery and development of next generation,
biologically active natural products and medicinal agents."
10842218,"SUMMARY
Particulate matter (PM) associated cardiorespiratory and vascular dysfunction (CaRVD) poses a significant
global health burden. The World Trade Center (WTC) destruction on September 11, 2001 led to an intense
deposition of particulate matter (WTC-PM) into aerodigestive system. WTC associated morbidities include
respiratory, gastrointestinal, chronic rhinosinusitis, cancer, mental health concerns and more recently a focus
has been on cardiovascular disease. Our proposal will investigate the development of WTC-cardiorespiratory
and vascular dysfunction (WTC-CaRVD) which is firmly within the purview of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health
and Compensation Act.
WTC-PM exposure causes heterogeneous obstructive airways disease (OAD) patterns, which include airway
hyperreactivity (AHR) and loss of FEV1. Early diagnosis and therapeutic options are few, in part due to our limited
understanding of their pathogenesis. While pulmonary vascular changes are classically thought to occur due to
the hypoxemia of late OAD, recent investigations show that vascular dysfunction occurs early in OAD. This
vascular hypothesis of OAD postulates that pulmonary vasculature remodeling leads to loss of lung function.
Early evidence of WTC-CaRVD includes increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as
metabolic syndrome, elevated pulmonary artery/aorta ratio, and cardiovascular biomarkers (such as CRP).
Murine models of WTC-PM exposure show inflammation, AHR both acutely and persistently and reflect what is
seen in FDNY 1st responders. Airway and cardiac remodeling were also persistent features of WTC-PM exposure
in our murine models. Therefore, we will focus on Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a mediator of oxidative stress,
known to stimulate collagen formation and is also induced after WTC-PM exposure. Furthermore, pathways and
mechanisms of WTC-CaRVD warrant further study and are the focus of our 5-year proposal.
Our HYPOTHESIS is that WTC-PM exposure causes WTC-CaRVD mediated by HO-1. First responders with
AHR will have features of WTC-CaRVD, and will demonstrate a unique biomarker profile compared to controls.
Innovative aspects of this application include novel imaging modalities and multiOmic
(radiome/metabolome/methylome) assessments. These hypotheses will be explored in three AIMs.
AIM 1, we will explore the translatability of our findings in the FDNY WTC cohort. AIM 2 will phenotype serum
biomarkers/metabolites, epigenetics, histology and in vivo imaging (echocardiography, MRI, and µPET/µCT) of
WTC-CaRVD. Furthermore, we will utilize mice genetically deficient in HO-1 and exogenously attenuate HO-1
in our murine WTC-PM model, AIM 2 and 3. AIM 3 will quantify end organ involvement and loss/gain of function
of HO-1 by myography and immunohistologic expression of vascular markers. Confirmation of the relevance of
the vascular and airway remodeling of WTC-PM associated AHR would allow us to then focus on early detection
and tailor our therapeutics in the WTC-PM exposed cohorts on mediators of oxidative stress."

Despite the availability of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine that can prevent over 34,800 HPV-related
cancers in the US every year, only 51% of girls and boys were up-to-date by 2018. Rural populations are the
most impacted by HPV-related cancers. Best practices like the Announcement Approach training and systems
communication have proven effective in increasing HPV vaccination, but rural providers struggle to access and
implement such best practices. These data prompt the question: “How can academic centers support HPV
vaccination in rural primary care practices?” Although never tested for HPV vaccination, the ECHO (Extension
for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Model is a promising implementation strategy (practice facilitation) that
allows “experts” at academic centers to connect with primary care providers to discuss best practices in care
and complex cases managed within local practices. The objective of this R01 is to test two ECHO-delivered
HPV vaccination communication interventions in rural primary care clinics. The first will provide Announcement
Approach training (HPV ECHO); the second will provide this approach plus systems strategies to communicate
with parents who initially decline vaccination (HPV ECHO+). The rationale for the project is that ECHO is a
robust, highly-accessible platform to deliver best practices to rural providers and address the context-specific
communication needs of parents. Our long-term goal is to improve HPV vaccination rates in rural clinics and
reduce the health inequity rural populations experience in cancer outcomes. Aim 1 is to evaluate the impact of
HPV ECHO and HPV ECHO+ on HPV vaccination among adolescents. We will conduct a 3-arm cluster
randomized trial with 36 primary care clinics in rural Pennsylvania. Clinics will be randomized to: HPV ECHO,
HPV ECHO+, or control. Our primary outcome will be change in HPV vaccine initiation (≥1 doses) among
adolescents, ages 11-14, at 12-month follow-up. Aim 2 is to evaluate the impact of HPV ECHO and HPV
ECHO+ on implementation outcomes. Guided by implementation science frameworks, we will conduct a
mixed-methods evaluation to compare interventions on acceptability, adoption, cost, penetration, and
sustainability. Aim 3 is to evaluate the impact of interventions’ vaccine information on secondary acceptance of
HPV vaccination at the clinic level. We will also follow a subset of 200 vaccine-declining parents for up to 12
months to assess exposure to and impact of vaccine information from study arms versus naturally-occurring
sources (e.g., social media) on secondary acceptance. Our expected outcome is to demonstrate the
effectiveness of a highly efficient and scalable implementation strategy, ECHO, to support HPV vaccination in
rural clinics. This study is innovative in leveraging existing infrastructure at academic centers to deliver best
practices for HPV vaccination where they are needed most and in developing a greater understanding of the
influences on decision making among vaccine-declining parents. We expect the project to have a significant
impact on HPV vaccine uptake as we address the communication needs of both rural providers and parents."

10842376,"Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel
mechanisms in post-liver transplant (LT) NASH fibrosis. Although LT is an effective therapy for NAFLD cirrhosis,
the risk of post-transplant NAFLD is alarmingly high, particularly for recurrent non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) with an incidence of up to 70% at 5 years. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment
and prevention of post-LT NASH fibrosis. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ
injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for post-
LT NASH fibrosis. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized
peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome
in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in post-LT NASH fibrosis. We
will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome of post-
LT NASH with fibrosis.. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features
independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be
predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel
established NAFLD/NASH. 2) To develop clinically-actionable predictive models of NASH and fibrosis post-LT.
Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall
outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will
therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types
to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The
resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers
that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of post-LT NASH
(hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining post-LT
NASH fibrosis. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the
ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion
of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify
biomarkers and conditional biomarkers. (2) Mechanistic understanding of post-LT NASH fibrosis: our models will
generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will
provide insights on the proteins that are involved and potentially new druggable targets. (3) Algorithm
development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include time-course
variables to be validated using a large prospective LT cohort."

The auditory system is posed with answering a challenging question: Does sound arriving at each ear originate
from a single source or multiple sources? To accomplish this perceptual feat, central auditory neural circuits
must accurately assess the spectral and temporal profile of bilateral sound signals to bind and integrate related
acoustic objects. Failure of this bilateral integrative process can account for many of the perceptual and
behavioral impairments that accompany auditory disorders, such as tinnitus, presbycusis and central auditory
processing disorders, which most of the population will experience over the lifespan. Surprisingly, the neural
mechanisms that enable this bilateral integration of acoustic information remain largely unknown, but likely
depend on an intricate balance of excitatory and inhibitory connections that link the two halves of the auditory
brain. Although commissural pathways have been well studied in auditory brainstem centers, much less is known
about the functional organization of commissural circuitry in higher centers of the auditory brain. Thus, the long-
term goals of our research are to understand the functional organization of the commissural pathways in the
processing of bilateral auditory information. Our primary objective here is to test a largely overlooked, yet
substantial, commissural auditory projection system, i.e. the pathway from the inferior colliculus to the
contralateral medial geniculate body. Our central hypothesis is that the medial geniculate body integrates
functionally and topographically aligned inputs from both the ipsilateral and contralateral inferior colliculi at a cell-
type specific level. Further, we hypothesize that the disruption of such bilateral tectothalamic convergence
results in deficits to the spectral and temporal processing of acoustic information in the medial geniculate body,
which contributes to disorders of the central auditory system. We will test our hypotheses by assessing: 1) the
functional neuroanatomy and 2) the neurophysiological impact of these contralateral tectothalamic pathways on
auditory processing, by employing modern, cell-type specific neuroanatomical and neurophysiological
approaches. As such, these studies are innovative since they address the unknown and unexplored functional
organization of the contralateral auditory tectothalamic pathways. Finally, the proposed experiments are
significant since they are expected to reveal mechanistic features of auditory processing that will have a positive
impact for neural diagnostics and treatments for central auditory impairments."

Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) affects ~3 million adults in the United States. These patients have a
poor quality of life due to chronic presyncopal symptoms and tachycardia that occur upon standing. Our
research has shown that meals rich in carbohydrates significantly exacerbate presyncopal symptoms in POTS,
however, the underlying mechanism that explains this clinical observation remains unknown.
Accordingly, our group conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the pathophysiology of POTS’ excessive
orthostatic tachycardia after glucose intake; we surveyed the hemodynamic and neurohormonal changes that
occurred after a 75-gr oral glucose challenge for up to 2-hrs (postprandial period) in POTS patients and healthy
controls. Compared with fasting conditions, the ingestion of glucose worsened upright tachycardia in POTS
patients, which was associated with a more robust reduction in upright stroke volume compared with healthy
controls. With regards to the disproportionate decrease in upright stroke volume in POTS patients, this could,
in part, be explained by a significant blood pooling in the splanchnic circulation. The splanchnic circulation is
the largest blood volume reservoir of the human body, storing ~25% of the total blood volume. Upon standing,
there is a significant blood pooling, which occurs mostly in the splanchnic veins. Finally, our study has also
shown that 30-min after the ingestion of 75-gr of glucose, POTS patients had a selectively increased secretion
of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) hormone compared with healthy controls. This
hormone has vasodilatory properties in the splanchnic circulation. Importantly, the increase in GIP secretion
was time-dependently associated with a fall in upright stroke volume after glucose intake in POTS.
Consequently, these findings point to the potential contribution of GIP in the pathophysiology of the increased
postprandial orthostatic tachycardia and presyncopal symptoms in POTS patients. As such, the overall goal of
this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation of orthostatic tachycardia and
POTS presyncopal symptoms in response to glucose ingestion. Specifically, we will evaluate the contribution
of GIP on the changes in the splanchnic venous capacitance after oral glucose and during upright posture in
POTS patients."

Biological macromolecules work together in a complex network to carry out essential cellular functions in living
organisms. Understanding this complex network of interactions at the molecular level by developing necessary
computational tools is an all-encompassing goal of our laboratory. This proposal aims to continue such efforts
particularly on CHARMM-GUI for the biomolecular modeling and simulation community, G-LoSA-related tools
for structural systems pharmacology, and GlycanStructure.ORG for glycan modeling and simulation and glycan
binding site prediction. First, CHARMM-GUI has become an essential web-based cyberinfrastructure for
constructing complex biomolecular simulation systems. We will further develop and expand its functionality to
support more force fields, QM/MM interface for enzymatic catalysis reactions, more advanced simulation
methods, API development, and DOI assignment. Second, we will continue to expand the application of our
local-structure centric computational toolset, G-LoSA (Graph-based Local Structure Alignment), for the studies
of protein-ligand interactions at the proteomic level. Our local structure refinement method will be extended to
include protein-protein binding interfaces to further elucidate conserved local surface regions of protein-protein
interactions that are crucial in biological processes. Third, our glycan modeling and simulation toolset will be
extended to glycan binding pose prediction, glycan binding site prediction, and glycan binding site optimization
for rational design and refinement of a known or potential glycan binding site. The successful completion of this
project is expected to provide a large and unique scope of research software tools for the biomedical research
community to carry out innovative and novel biomolecular modeling and simulation research for the prevention

Over evolutionary time, species access innovations that evolve in parallel lineages. The mitochondrion and
chloroplast genome-transfers provide stunning examples. The experimental transfer of DNA has begun to
provide a glimpse at—and a handle to explore—this fundamental process. C. elegans, whose rapid life cycle
calls upon the germline to function every few days, is an ideal animal in which to investigate transgenerational
systems that regulate information. This project will explore the following questions: 1) How do cells distinguish
‘licensed’ from potentially dangerous ‘unlicensed’ information? 2) How do Argonautes and chromatin regulators
coordinate to propagate gene-expression states? 3) How do distinct Argonaute systems integrate to achieve
surveillance and how is transcriptome surveillance organized spatially? A remarkable feature of RNA surveillance
in the worm germline is that both silenced and expressed states are communicated to offspring via small RNAs.
These small-RNA signals comprise approximately one million different guide-RNA species that engage a dozen
different germline Argonautes. Initiators of silencing—e.g., dsRNA, piRNAs, and recently intronless mRNAs—
have been relatively easy to identify. Yet, insights into mechanisms that ensure pathway specificity have been
elusive. Moreover, the coordination between small RNA pathways and heterochromatin remains murky.
Preliminary studies suggest that peri-nuclear nuage domains marked by RNA-binding proteins differentiate from
each other to direct distinct RNA-silencing tasks, and nuage domains appear to communicate or associate with
the small-RNA source loci in the nucleus. This compartmentalization could dramatically simplify the math for
whole transcriptome silencing. Instead of millions of guide complexes in each nuage domain, only about 20,000
distinct guide-RNA species would be needed to silence adjacent heterochromatin. Understanding the cascading
effects that shift the balance of RNA binding and surveillance in nuage and heterochromatin could shed light on
related perturbations that cause a myriad of human disorders."

This R35 application requests support to expand research funded via NIGMS in the Peters laboratory during the
past five years (JCP as PI: R01-070757; JCP as co-investigator (Greg Fu as PI): R01-109194), where we have

protoncoupled electron transfer (PCET) steps that may level the turnover-limiting potential of N2R. Exciting new
tools to electrochemically and photochemically initiate PCET steps to Fe–NxHy species are described, as are
studies to control catalytic selectivity (NH3 vs N2H4 vs H2) via new reagent and catalyst development motivated
by mechanistic data. These varied pursuits promise increasingly efficient models of biocatalytic N2R. New
research on photoinduced, Cu-catalyzed C–N (and other C–C and C–heteroatom) couplings is also described.
As most all medicines and drug candidates contain at least one carbon–nitrogen bond, the continued
development of diverse methods for the formation of C–N bonds is needed. Our discovery of photoinduced,
Cu-catalyzed C–X couplings (in partnership with the Fu laboratory) has led to a fascinating range of catalytic N-
alkylations and related couplings that include (but are not limited to) secondary alkyl bromides and iodides,
and activated tertiary chlorides, as electrophiles, in combination with a range of N–nucleophiles (e.g., anilines,
amines, amides, carbazoles). These methods include examples of enantioconvergent couplings. We now describe
research towards well-defined copper(I) complexes featuring chelating LX-type ligands that engender favorable
photophysical properties (i.e., long-lived and strongly reducing excited states) to engage, via electron transfer,
unactivated alkyl chlorides, thus furnishing organic radical R× intermediates key in C–N cross-couplings. This
research may lead to more universally applicable copper(I) photoreductants in this coupling chemistry. Finally,
oxidative catalytic pathways to C–N bond constructions are also proposed, including C–H aminations and
aziridinations, directly from amine (RR’NH) precursors. Such transformations most typically require
preoxidized nitrogen sources. Based on our recent ammonia oxidation (AO) catalysis studies, (2 NH3 « N2 +
6H+ + 6 e–), we hypothesize oxidative transformations directly from amine substrates to form C–N bonds
mediated by polypyridyl iron complexes."

10842769,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of my research program is to elucidate redox signaling mechanisms underlying disease
initiation and progression and develop therapeutic strategies that target deregulated pathways. In a physiological
context, the reversible oxidation of reactive cysteine residues within proteins elicits a spectrum of structural
alterations that allow cellular oxidants production to be coupled with changes in protein activity and cell function.
Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are such proteins whose function is transiently inactivated in response to
regulated and localized rises in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cells. PTPs dephosphorylate and modulate the
activity of protein kinases and other signaling proteins, underscoring the importance of physiological mechanisms
that inhibit specific PTPs through reversible oxidation. While we know that the inactivation of specific PTPs is
essential to regulate phosphorylation-dependent signaling, we have recently shown that the underlying
mechanisms that regulate the oxidation and reduction of PTPs are far more complex than anticipated. Building
on our seminal discoveries on PTP regulation, we have uncovered novel oxidation and reduction mechanisms
that regulate PTP activity in vivo. Based on published and pilot studies, we propose to characterize and further
explore the broad mechanistic and biological impacts of projects in which we show: 1) oxidation relay-mediated
reversible oxidation of PTPs; 2) non-canonical allosteric PTP reduction by cholesterol; and 3) approaches to
leverage our mechanistic insights to develop small molecules that activate specific PTPs and fine-tune
exacerbated phosphorylation-dependent signaling. Based on our productive track record working on the redox
regulation of PTPs, my research program proposes ways to elucidate the underlying mechanism by which PTPs
are turned off in cells and novel means to specifically activate members of this large, understudied, family of
enzymes. PTPs are an untapped resource, and understanding the complexity of their catalytic regulation by
redox mechanisms will generate knowledge and resources with high potential for translation into therapeutic
modalities."
10842780,"Characterizing the Molecular Basis of Supergene Mimicry in Butterflies
Project Summary
Why is life on Earth so diverse? How do these diverse forms arise, both over evolutionary time and during
development? What are the functional molecular and genetic changes that underlie the fantastic organismal
diversity we see in the natural world? My research focuses on these big questions related to the origin of
biodiversity, but I do so through the lens of mechanism. Butterflies, and butterfly wing patterns in particular,
offer an excellent system to unlock the functional molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for
organismal evolution because of their natural diversity, a long history of research that puts this diversity in a
much-needed ecological context, and our success at establishing genomic and genome editing tools for
butterflies. My research team and I study diversity using multiple approaches, including molecular and
population genetics, genomics, developmental biology techniques, functional genomics, genome editing,
neurobiology, behavioral experiments, and computation. The ultimate goal of this work is very fundamental: I
strive to characterize the functional mechanisms responsible for historical evolutionary processes while also
uncovering basic principles of biological patterning, development, and behavior. Much of our research is
focused on the phenomenon of sex-limited polymorphism, which is widespread in animals but is not well
understood in any organism. “Supergene” mimicry in the swallowtail butterfly Papilio polytes stands out as a
particularly striking example of sex-limited polymorphism and one that is amenable to functional
characterization. While much theoretical work has explored the evolutionary dynamics of supergene mimicry,
we are just beginning to unpack its molecular and developmental basis. Previously we determined that the
gene doublesex controls the mimicry switch in P. polytes and we have studied the origin and evolution of
mimicry, behavioral aspects of mimicry, natural selection in nature, and we have developed tools and methods
for CRISPR and multiple functional genomics assays. Using these tools, we have begun to characterize the
cis-regulatory architecture of doublesex, as well as the gene regulatory networks that are modified by
doublesex to produce novel mimetic wing patterns. Over the next five years, we will investigate the functional
basis of supergene mimicry in P. polytes by integrating genomics, functional genetics, molecular and
developmental biology, providing the single most comprehensive investigation of its kind. Furthermore, we will
greatly expand the scope of our analyses by branching out on the butterfly phylogeny to functionally
characterize parallel evolution of supergene mimicry in other butterflies. Our work will greatly expand the
known role of the sexual differentiation pathway and generate general insights into fundamental evolutionary
genetic processes of convergence, cis-regulatory evolution, and gene co-option."

My lab has pioneered studies defining how cells initiate and maintain a quiescent state in the face of nutrient
deprivation and quantifying the role of copy number variation in rapid adaptive evolution. In this proposal, we
have outlined two central areas of research that extend this work. The first project is aimed at investigating
how protein expression programs and cellular biology is remodeled in quiescent cells. Cell quiescence
is the dominant state of all cells, but the most poorly understood. Our prior research has defined the genetic
requirements for quiescence and quantified genetic interactions with evolutionarily conserved signaling
pathways that are required for quiescence. In our proposed research we will study the dynamics of gene
expression remodeling in quiescent cells at the level of protein expression using metabolic labeling and mass
spectrometry. We will define the role of key signaling pathways by studying defects in gene expression
remodeling in strains mutant for TORC1, PKA, AMPK, and PHO85. To study remodeling of the cellular
environment in quiescence we will use genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) and live cell
imaging to quantify changes in cellular crowding in quiescent cells. We will also study mutants in vacuole
biogenesis to test the role of this organelle in reorganizing the cellular environment in quiescence. We will
define genetic factors that contribute to drug tolerance in quiescent cells and leverage this information to test
approaches to increasing antifungal drug effectiveness in quiescent cells in the fungal pathogens Candida
albicans and Candida glabrata. Our second project is aimed at understanding the dynamics of copy
number variation in evolving populations and their functional consequences. Copy number variants
(CNVs) are a prevalent source of genetic variation in humans, in which they underlie both heritable diseases
and pathogenic somatic variation. CNVs underlie phenotypic variation in a range of organisms and often
confer resistance to therapeutic treatment in pathogenic microbes. Our studies have demonstrated that CNVs
are frequent drivers of rapid adaptive evolution during microbial experimental evolution in chemostat cultures.
We have developed a combined CNV reporter and lineage tracking system that enables accurate
quantification of CNV dynamics in efficient methods for multiplexed mutant analysis. Using a combination of
these approaches, we will study the dynamics of CNV-mediated adaptive evolution in fluctuating environments.
We will then test the fitness effects of CNVs in conditions in which they have been selected, in which we
expect them to confer a fitness benefit, and a diversity of additional conditions, in which we expect them to be
neutral or deleterious. By incorporating known features of CNVs, we will build a quantitative model of their
fitness costs and benefits. To investigate the functional effects of CNVs we will quantify their gene expression
consequences at the level of mRNA abundance and ribosome occupancy and test their effect on gene
expression heterogeneity using single cell RNA sequencing."

This project focuses on elucidating the mechanisms of evolution at the molecular and population-genetic levels
by integrating theoretical and experimental work in a wide phylogenetic framework. The molecular focus is on
cellular rates of error production in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, in particular erroneous protein
production resulting from messenger RNA mistranslation. This work will test the drift-barrier hypothesis, which
postulates that the level of refinement that natural selection can achieve with any trait is limited by the power of
random drift but enhanced by the effective genome size and/or number of molecular transactions. Newly
developed methods in proteomics will yield rigorous estimates of the apparently high rates at which erroneous
amino acids are incorporated into proteins, complementing prior work at DNA and RNA levels.
 The genetic mechanisms of evolution will be clarified by integrating population-genomic surveys of 1000s
of genotypic isolates of the model microcrustacean Daphnia pulex and related species with functional analyses
of key genes known to be involved phenotypic divergence. This work will reveal the relative magnitudes of drift,
mutation, and recombination in a collection of ~30 populations, far beyond that for any other species. Combined
with a long-term temporal survey, the results will enable a test of the hypothesis that variation at the level of gene
structure and genomic architecture is directly driven by the local population-genetic environment. The D. pulex
system has unique features for gaining insights into major unsolved mysteries in evolutionary genetics, including
the causes and consequences of the loss of meiotic recombination, the genetic mechanisms of sex determination,
and the coevolutionary constraints within and among mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genes as determinants
of ribosome structure and bioenergetic capacity.
 A third project develops evolutionary theory, which combined with the empirical observations, is
designed to clarify how phenotypic divergence emerges among isolated lineages. Special attention will be given
to the joint roles played by genetic drift and fluctuating selection in driving adaptive and nonadaptive patterns
of evolution, as well as to matters of molecular coevolution that form the basis of most intracellular features.
 Because cellular integrity depends on the production of proper proteins, our work on translation fidelity
has broad significance for diverse human-health issues, including matters related to cellular toxicity and protein
aggregation. By integrating direct observations on the relative power of drift, mutation, recombination, and
fluctuating selection, the population-genomics work will yield insight into the factors driving the efficiencies and
mechanisms by which all species respond to natural selection. Elucidation of the molecular/cellular mechanisms
converting sexual reproduction to asexual propagation via unfertilized eggs and the separate mechanisms
preventing male production will open up possibilities of clonal propagation in diverse species as well as possible
strategies for pest control."

Chromosome inheritance during cell proliferation is fundamental for living systems. Failures in this process
cause diverse diseases, such as cancer. Through the development of various innovative methods and the
exploitation of the unique Xenopus egg extract cell free system, our research program studies structure,
function, and regulation of the nucleosome - the fundamental structural unit for chromosomal DNA - in
chromosome inheritance and integrity.
1) Roles of nucleosomes in mitotic chromosome structure, integrity and function. High resolution 3D structural
analysis of nucleoprotein complexes on functional chromosomes has been impossible. We propose to combine
an innovative cryo-EM method and nucleosome manipulation method that we developed in Xenopus egg
extracts to study how nucleosome dynamics and integrity are regulated on mitotic chromosomes.
2) Centromere-associated repeats and DNA methylation. Mutations in DNMT3B, ZBTB24, CDCA7, and HELLS
cause Immunodeficiency, Centromere instability and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome. We have demonstrated
that CDCA7 is a critical activator for the nucleosome remodeling by HELLS. Expression of HELLS, CDCA7 and
its paralog CDCA7L are linked to various cancers. While multiple roles of HELLS, including DNA methylation,
loading of macroH2A, and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), have been reported, it is not clear how CDCA7
contributes to these diverse processes and how they are related to immunodeficiency and cancers. We will
address this question through dissecting the molecular function of CDCA7 and HELLS.
3) Mitotic regulation of cGAS. cGAS is a critical innate immunity pattern receptor targeting pathogenic DNA.
cGAS binds to DNA and becomes activated to synthesize cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP activates
STING, which then triggers signal transduction pathway to promote inflammation. How does cGAS avoid being
activated by the host’s chromosomal DNA? We gave an answer to this question by demonstrating that the
nucleosome directly binds cGAS to block its DNA-dependent activation. However, when cGAS binds to
chromosomes during mitotic arrest, cGAS slowly becomes reactivated and induces apoptosis. Using Xenopus
egg extracts where we can precisely control nucleosome assembly, DNA, and cell cycle stages without being
confounded by downstream events, we will dissect the mechanism of mitotic suppression and reactivation of
cGAS."

The aim of this Shared Instrumentation Grant application is to provide the growing structural biology
community at UT Health San Antonio (UTHSA) with access to High-Performance Computing capabilities. The
UTHSA Structural Biology Core Facility (SBC) enjoys a rich 25-year history in structural biology with a
consistent group of NIH-funded researchers using structural techniques (cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, and
NMR) as a hallmark of their research programs focused on drug discovery and basic mechanisms aiming to
improve human health. While the SBC has managed to provide users with adequate computational and
storage resources to process X-ray crystallography and NMR data over the years, a severe computational
bottleneck for SBC users has arisen due to: 1) the recent addition of cryo-EM to the suite of structural biology
tools available at UTHSA and 2) the emergence of AI-based software used to process experimental structural
biology data and for modeling of large protein complexes. Both of these use cases require powerful hardware
that is currently unavailable anywhere on campus and is cost prohibitive for most individual investigators,
thereby creating a barrier to entry that limits the impact the SBC has on its users’ research programs.
These computing needs of the SBC are best served by dedicated hardware specifically tailored to meet the
system requirements of workhorse software used for cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, and NMR data
processing. The proposed equipment prioritizes shared memory, high-throughput architecture, and storage
and consists of a GPU cluster of 6 nodes with 24 RTX A6000 GPUs with 48GB RAM in addition to a single
node with 4 state-of-the art A100 GPUs with 80 GB RAM. Each node comes with 2x Intel Xeon scalable 16-
core processors. For further parallelization and for less computation-heavy processes, a CPU cluster of 4x
Intel Xeon Scalable Gold 6330H Processor 24-Cores is included along with 1.5 petabytes of raw storage
capacity. This state-of-the-art configuration will allow SBC users to tap into all of the latest software for
structural biology data processing and is particularly well-suited for computationally intensive cryo-EM and AI-
based data processing that is sorely needed on our campus.
The proposed High-Performance Computing Cluster will be housed in the University’s Advanced Data Center
and will provide cost-effective resources for 15-20 UTHSA SBC users to simultaneously process cryo-EM, X-
ray, and NMR data using current state-of-the-art software while also opening up AI-based processing capability
to an even larger cohort of investigators on campus. The cluster will provide a boost to the productivity and
accessibility of our new cryo-EM laboratory at a crucial time in its development, while extending the capabilities
of longstanding SBC infrastructure. From a broader perspective, the cluster will accelerate the research efforts
of NIH-funded investigators, enrich the intellectual and scientific environment at UTHSA, foster development of
joint grant applications, and create new training opportunities for postdoctoral and graduate trainees."

Relapse of leukemia occurs in nearly half of patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). While there
are a growing number of therapeutic options for leukemic relapse after HCT, we lack a clinical assay capable of
simultaneously detecting disease and triaging patients to treatment which will most likely benefit them. In this
application, we propose to rigorously evaluate and employ novel single-cell genomic methods and their
accompanying computational approaches to detect disease at low levels, inform mechanisms of relapse, and
direct future therapy. In Aim 1, we will optimize computational methods for detecting natural genetic variation
between donor and recipient, a diagnostic maneuver we believe will improve the sensitivity of detecting malignant
cells after HCT. We will then validate these methods using samples from patients in a retrospective fashion. To
provide insight into mechanisms of relapse, we have developed a novel molecular approach for identifying
perturbations in HLA and related genes, a common means by which leukemia evades the immune system after
HCT. In Aim 2, we will validate this method in a manner that explores the lower limit of detection for HLA-
perturbed cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we will build on decades of work using flow cytometry to assess the
heterogeneity of myeloid neoplasms by integrating our single-cell molecular measures with cell-surface
immunophenotype. Using this approach, we seek to define common molecular signatures in leukemia-initiating
cells (LICs), a subset of cells in myeloid neoplasms thought to be a chemo-resistant reservoir of leukemia. The
proposed studies will establish a new method for surveillance of residual disease after HCT, which we believe
will provide a deeper level of confidence and insight into leukemic relapse post-transplant. We expect these
studies to form the foundational preclinical data for a single-cell genomics clinical assay capable of risk-stratifying
patients with early evidence of leukemic relapse after HCT."

TITLE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The choice of vasopressors to prevent
postoperative acute kidney injury after major non-cardiac surgery: a multicenter
pragmatic cluster cross-over randomized trial (the VEGA-2 trial)
Title ( max 81 characters )
Norepinephrine vs Phenylephrine for preventing postoperative acute kidney injury
Abstract (30 lines)
Around 50 million patients have surgery every year in the United States. Postoperative acute
kidney injury (PO-AKI) is a major complication after surgery, occurring in 10 to 40% of cases
after major surgery. PO-AKI is associated with higher risk of chronic kidney disease,
cardiovascular events, prolonged hospitalization, higher costs, and mortality. Prevention of PO-
AKI is considered a major outcome in perioperative medicine. Intraoperative hypotension has been
repeatedly associated with an increased risk of PO-AKI and hypotension is a major contributing
factor to PO-AKI. Prevention of hypotension is recommended to decrease the risk of PO-AKI.
Vasopressors are the key pharmacologic intervention for the management of hypotension due to
vasodilation induced by general anesthesia or the systemic inflammation triggered by the surgery.
Phenylephrine and norepinephrine are the two most common intravenous vasopressors used for
this purpose. However, the optimal choice of vasopressor to treat hypotension during surgery under
general anesthesia is unknown. Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 agonist (vasoconstrictor), whereas
norepinephrine has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects (vasoconstrictor/inotrope).
Norepinephrine increases cardiac output and cardiovascular coupling and decreases inflammation-
induced vascular permeability. Norepinephrine increases renal blood flow in vasodilatory shock.
While several experts have recommended using norepinephrine as the first line vasopressor,
randomized trials are missing, preventing to draw strong recommendations. Given the number of
patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery under anesthesia in the United States each year and
the burden of PO-AKI, this is a major unaddressed question. We propose to perform a multicenter
cluster-randomized, open-labeled, multiple-crossover trial of phenylephrine versus norepinephrine
as the first-line infusion vasopressor in adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with general
anesthesia within the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG). This trial follows a
pilot cluster-randomized trial (VEGA-1 trial, NCT04789330) that showed the feasibility of the
trial in enrolling 3626 patients and provided key preliminary data. This study will provide the
highest level of evidence regarding the best vasopressor to use and perfectly aligns with the
mission of NIDDK to prevent kidney disease and improve health in the surgical population. This
evidence generated by this trial will inform clinical guidelines and ultimately impact patient
outcomes.

10859747,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The maintenance of genome stability across generations is critical for human health and relies on the
efficient repair of spontaneous DNA lesions and the faithful duplication of all chromosomal DNA prior to cell
division. The highly conserved DNA sliding clamps PCNA and 9-1-1 are critical for these genome maintenance
mechanisms in eukaryotic cells by acting as mobile hubs for the assembly of the protein complexes mediating
the signaling and repair of DNA damage and conducting the faithful replication of the nuclear chromosomes.
The dynamic association of PCNA and 9-1-1 with chromosomal DNA is controlled by a set of four conserved
and related ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes that each perform non-redundant genome maintenance
functions in the cell. How eukaryotic clamp loaders target their client clamps to sites of DNA replication and
repair and load the clamps around DNA has been the subject of intense investigation for several decades.
Using advanced biochemical reconstitution approaches and cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM), we
have recently determined the first structures of active eukaryotic clamp loader:clamp:DNA complexes, which
revealed the molecular basis for the substrate specificities of the yeast RFC and Rad24-RFC complexes and
resulted in a significant revision of current clamp loading models. Building on this work, here we propose to
extend and advance the approaches established by us for the yeast RFC:PCNA and Rad24-RFC:9-1-1 clamp
loader systems to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the yeast and human orthologues of Ctf18-
RFC:PCNA, Elg1ATAD5-RFC:PCNA, and RAD17-RFC:9-1-1. The innovative approach leverages the expertise
of Dr. Remus’ laboratory in the biochemical reconstitution of eukaryotic DNA replication and the expertise of
Dr. Hite’s laboratory in the characterization of the conformational landscapes of protein complexes by cryo-EM.
The proposed studies will determine the mechanistic basis for the functional specialization of CTF18-RFC
(Aim 1), uncover the currently unknown mechanism of PCNA unloading by Elg1ATAD5-RFC:PCNA (Aim 2) and
visualize the spectrum of conformational states of the human RAD17-RFC:9-1-1 complex to reveal the
evolutionary conservation or divergence of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp loading mechanism (Aim 3).
Collectively, this work will provide novel mechanistic insight into fundamental genome maintenance pathways."
10859381,"ABSTRACT
Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) experience early onset and a higher burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
compared to community controls. Such health disparity is largely attributable to cancer treatments at a young
age. While the increased risk and high burden of CVD among CCS have been described extensively, there is
little information available from mechanistic investigations that illuminate causal pathways leading from cancer
treatment exposures to development of CVD. To better understand the pathogenesis of CVD, there is an urgent
need for research that employs an integrated approach to unravel the influence of, and complex interplay
between, prior therapeutic exposures, inherited genetic susceptibility and modifiable health behaviors. In the
current grant proposal, we will focus on seven common cardiometabolic outcomes, including five modifiable CVD
risk increasing conditions (abnormal glucose metabolism, obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and
hypercholesterolemia), and two outcomes of end-organ damage (cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction)
among aging CCS. Our research framework will address the roles of genetic and epigenetic associations with
cardiometabolic risk within the context of cancer treatment exposures and post-treatment health behaviors.
Specifically, we will characterize rare pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants (PGV) in genes of DNA
repair, immune responses, especially inflammation response pathways, and drug metabolism, and evaluate the
associations between PGV carriers and cardiometabolic conditions while adjusting for common genetic variants
expressed as a polygenic risk score (PRS). We will investigate variations of DNA methylation and hence altered
gene expression as a mechanistic link between exposures (cancer treatments, and/or health behaviors) and
cardiometabolic conditions. Furthermore, we will integrate multiple aging biomarkers (clonal hematopoiesis,
leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age) and evaluate them as additional predictors for cardiometabolic
risk. Our study will leverage the singular resource of the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) with a three time point
longitudinal study design, and novel findings will be validated/replicated among survivors from the Childhood
Cancer Survivor (CCSS) cohort. Of note, multi-omics data generated from this study will not only fulfill the specific
aims for this proposed project and will also allow us to generate a functional genomic database encompassing
methylation quantitative trait loci, expression quantitative loci and expression quantitative trait methylation. This
reference database will have a meaningful impact on future genetic and genomic studies conducted on CCS.
Taken together, we will investigate both “nature” (i.e., inherited genetics) and “nurture” (i.e., exposomes) to
comprehensively evaluate the landscape of the cardiometabolic risk factors/predictors in CCS. The successful
completion of this project will provide translational pathways towards surveillance and intervention strategies for
improvement of survivorship care as well as generate new hypotheses for future basic science research."

The U.S. and Mexico share similar population disease patterns such as high rates of chronic diseases (e.g.,
heart disease and obesity). Individuals residing in border regions often travel back and forth between the U.S.
and Mexico, which exposes them to both different and similar obesogenic, socio-cultural, and physical
environments. This frequent transnational interaction has led researchers to classify border cities as one region
that should be studied as a whole. As such, it is important to systematically study border populations and develop
effective interventions and public policy for this region. This study will test the efficacy and sustainability of a 12-
month family-centered behavioral cluster randomized intervention, Athletes for Life (AFL), plus a 1-year active
sustainability phase in community recreation centers in San Diego, California (U.S.) and Mexicali, Baja California
(Mexico). This study will also assess intervention implementation outcomes, including program acceptability and
feasibility by families and community recreation center staff. A total of 8 community recreation centers and 290
parent/child dyads (4 in San Diego and 4 in Mexicali) will be randomized to either a control group consisting of
standard recreation center classes (delivered by regular recreation center staff) or an experimental group
consisting of the multilevel AFL behavioral intervention (delivered by study staff). This study aims to increase
total habitual physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular fitness (CVF) in a U.S.-Mexico transborder population
that experiences disproportionately high rates of obesity. We will harness our research team's extensive
experience in developing multi-level interventions to promote behavior change among Latinos, and leverage a
strong community-academic collaboration that maximizes community impact and sustainability. The long-term
goal of this project is to reduce cardiovascular disease and cardiometabolic risk factors among underserved
children and their families in the US-Mexico border region. This research will provide novel empirical evidence
for the efficacy, scalability, and sustainability of a multilevel fitness- and lifestyle-oriented family approach
delivered in collaboration with community centers among underserved Latino families in the U.S.-Mexico border
region."

Throughout recorded history, humans have used natural products for medicinal purposes. With the onset of
modern analytical and pharmaceutical methods, the active ingredients in some of these “natural remedies” were
identified and became foundational chemicals in drug development efforts. Among the numerous examples,
aspirin (bark of the willow tree), capsaicin (chili peppers), and opioids (opium poppy plant) are notable for their
analgesic properties. Similar to these other natural products, Cannabis sativa has long been used for medicinal
purposes, including pain relief. The cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa/indica) contains over 100
phytocannabinoids as well as over 500 other identified chemicals, including the terpenoids that give cannabis its
distinctive flavoring and aroma. Beyond 9-THC and CBD, however, difficulties in identifying, isolating and
purifying minor phytocannabinoids in quantities sufficient for in vivo evaluation have hampered adequate
investigation of potential therapeutic uses of individual phytocannabinoids. Recently, we have secured access
to purified minor cannabinoids synthesized via a patented biosynthetic process in quantities that allow for
preclinical in vivo testing. The goal of the proposed project is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of these
compounds alone, and in planned combinations, to determine their potential efficacy as analgesics. In addition,
we will conduct a parallel investigation of selected terpenes that have been identified in the cannabis plant. Novel
analgesic strategies are needed to combat over-reliance on opioids and the resulting secondary consequences
of dependence and morbidity/mortality."
10859653,"Project Summary/Abstract
Here, we propose to study cancer etiology in the context of DNA damage caused by a methylating agent, N-
nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen that has been found in water, food, and drugs.
NDMA is both mutagenic and toxic, and our overriding hypothesis is that its biological consequences are shaped
interactions among three repair pathways: direct reversal, mismatch repair (MMR), and homologous
recombination (HR). One of the key DNA lesions created by NDMA is O6MeG, which mispairs readily with
thymine. The direct reversal protein O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) removes the offending
methyl group, restoring the structure of guanine. Interestingly, O6MeG can become toxic when acted upon by
Mismatch Repair (MMR), although the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated in vivo. Normally,
MMR recognizes mismatches behind the replication fork and removes the newly synthesized strand to give the
cell another chance at accurate replication. In the case of O6MeG, it has been posited that MMR removes the
strand opposite the lesion forming a single strand gap that upon the subsequent replication cycle becomes a
broken fork (i.e., a double strand break [DSB]) that requires HR for repair. Despite the prevalence of this model
in the literature, these predicted processes have been largely untested in vivo, a key gap in the literature that will
be addressed in part by using an in-house genetically engineered mouse model, namely RaDR, for which HR
yields a fluorescent signal. An advantage of RaDR is that it can also be used for lineage tracing, which makes it
possible to monitor clonal expansion. Using the RaDR mice, we made the remarkable discovery that MGMT
strongly suppresses clonal expansion. Our overriding hypothesis is that MMR promotes toxicity and
inflammation, providing selective pressure for clonal expansion. Specific Aim 1 is to test the MMR model by
measuring the replication dependence of DSBs and HR to elucidate possible dependence on two cycles of
replication, which would be consistent with gap-driven fork breakdown. Specific Aim 2 is to quantify clonal
expansion, to leverage 2-photon microscopy for whole-organ 3D imaging of clonal outgrowths, and to peer into
clonal outgrowths via spatial transcriptomics to reveal underlying mechanisms of clonal expansion. Specific Aim
3 is to quantify the impact of MGMT, MMR, and their interaction on NDMA-induced inflammation and cancer in
the liver. The proposed work will not only elucidate the ways by which interactions among DNA repair pathways
modulate susceptibility to DNA damage, but it will also be one of the first studies of how DNA repair shapes the
risk of clonal expansion, a fundamentally important step in carcinogenesis. Together, these studies will have a
significant and lasting impact by advancing our understanding of the molecular forces that shape disease with
important implications to public health and the clinic."
10859654,"Cardiovascular (CV) therapeutics remain dangerously understudied in children: of 1055 FDA pediatric label
changes under BPCA and PREA since 1998, only 29 were in CV drugs, and >90% of the sickest children with
CV disease in intensive care units are exposed to ≥1 off-label drug, a practice known to worsen outcomes.
Modern approaches to pediatric drug labeling are based on pharmacometric models to evaluate drug exposure
response relationships, and when appropriate correlate them with adult findings. A lack of pediatric CV patient-
oriented scientists trained in these methods is the primary obstacle to more widespread labeling of CV drugs.
With my unique background in pediatric cardiology and critical care, biostatistics, clinical pharmacology, and
innovative early-phase clinical trial and real-world data utilization, I am exceptionally well positioned to close
this training gap in junior CV patient-oriented scientists. Now in my 10th year on faculty at Duke and the Duke
Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), I built an NIH, FDA, and foundation funded research portfolio of early-phase
pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic trials, regulatory compliant pharmacometric modeling and simulation,
and innovative real-world-data utilization to study pediatric CV drug development. I systematically leveraged
my portfolio to create opportunities for training and mentoring for 23 trainees to date. With the support of this
K24, I will expand my mentorship and training program to a larger number of more diverse trainees, and
obtained formal skills in mentorship, novel modeling techniques, and innovative real-world-data applications. I
have developed and secured funding for an innovative, point-of-care, electronic health record data enabled
multi-drug platform PK/PD trial, OPTIC, designed specifically for training and mentorship. In this platform trial,
each trainee owns a single CV drug studied within a multi-drug protocol which I oversee, and will receive
hands-on training from protocol writing through enrolling of subjects and data analysis for their drug. Coupled
with an expectation for formal didactic coursework towards a master’s or PhD degree in quantitative sciences
at Duke or the University of North Carolina (UNC), my trainees will receive rigorous training to prepare them as
independently funded patient-oriented investigators focused on pediatric CV clinical pharmacology. In addition
to my own funding, the proposed training program is supported by an exceptional research environment at
DCRI including the NICHD funded Pediatric Trials Network focused on pediatric drug development, and my
leadership roles as Director of the DCRI Pharmacometrics Center, and Program Director of a joint Duke-UNC
T32 training program in clinical pharmacology. DCRI’s unique pipeline of NIH funded clinical research training
programs, ranging from R38 summer programs for undergraduate students to early-career faculty K12 awards
are ideal to recruit trainees. While rigorous and demanding, the feasibility of my proposed training program is
supported by my success with funding and career development of current trainees including: 62 first-author
publications with me, multiple early-career and NIH awards; >80% of graduates in academic positions."
10859206,"Bacterial Vaginosis (BV), a disorder of the vaginal microbiota characterized by low levels of protective
Lactobacilli and higher abundance of a variety of anaerobic bacteria colonizing the vagina, is the leading cause
of vaginal complaints in cis-gender women and associates with increased risk of preterm birth and HIV and STI
acquisition. Recommended first-line BV therapies include oral or vaginal metronidazole or vaginal clindamycin,
although most are treated with metronidazole; clindamycin is much less frequently used. It is well known that
60% of BV recurs within 1 year after antibiotics. What is less appreciated, however, is that a significant
proportion of patients may experience poor outcomes (either persistent, refractory BV [refBV] or early
symptomatic recurrence [erBV]) within 6 weeks after standard BV therapy. Defining vaginal micro-
environmental factors at the time of symptomatic BV (sBV) diagnosis that associate with subsequent ref or
erBV, could provide critical insights into disease pathophysiology and inform the development of candidate
clinical biomarkers to predict these conditions. In the long term, this could change clinical practice by
identifying a priori those for whom standard BV treatments are likely to be inadequate, who may need more
aggressive initial therapy with regimens currently reserved only for those with demonstrated recurrent BV (≥3
recurrences in 12 months), [e.g. alternative or higher dose antibiotics, intra-vaginal boric acid, suppressive
antibiotics, or novel bio-therapeutics currently under development.] Early data suggest vaginal microbiota
features, or a disordered immune response may predict ref or erBV. Additionally, virulence factors of specific
BV-associated bacteria may lead to vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) damage, revealing deeper (immature) VEC
layers and resulting in decreased glycogen to support Lactobacillus growth, increasing risk of ref or erBV. Long
term, deciding which adjunctive treatments to use or to develop for those at risk of poor outcomes early after
therapy will depend on understanding underlying biologic mechanisms driving disease. The focus of this grant
is to identify vaginal microenvironmental factors associated with ref or erBV. Our work will also establish a
sample repository to be used for future studies to characterize the pathophysiology of ref and erBV. We
propose to recruit a cohort of patients diagnosed with acute BV and follow them over 6 weeks to accomplish
these Aims: 1. Establish a prospective cohort and specimen repository from individuals with refBV, erBV and
early remission. 2. Using advanced metagenomic techniques, compare the vaginal microbiome at sBV
diagnosis prior to treatment in those who experience ref and erBV vs. early remission. 3. Assess mucosal
immunologic profiles, vaginal glycogen and VEC maturity at sBV diagnosis in those who experience ref and
erBV vs. early remission. The study will be fully powered to assess aims in those initiating metronidazole (the
most commonly used therapy) for acute BV. This research will identify candidate predictive biomarkers for ref/
erBV, and, long term, will provide data to inform mechanistic and interventional studies to improve BV care."
10837485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to organophosphate (OP) nerve agents leads to quick overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors, causing substantial mortality and morbidities associated with damages to the brain.
Current medical countermeasure drugs, such as midazolam, atropine, diazepam, and 2-PAM, are of doubtful
utility for civilian populations as they must be administered within minutes of an attack to be effective. Nor can
they prevent the long-term neurotoxicity and behavioral comorbidities due to the persistent neuroinflammation
and aggravated brain injury. Although inhibition of acetylcholinesterase is the conventional mechanism
underlying the acute neurotoxicity of OPs, several lines of evidence support essential contributions of
uncontrolled inflammation to pathogenic changes within the brain after OP intoxication, in which prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) is widely believed to play a pivotal role. As such, blocking cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme
responsible for the initial step of PGE2 biosynthesis, was previously considered as a promising strategy to
reduce pathogenic PGE2 in the injured brain but turned out to be problematic due to side effects related to the
reduction in other COX-derived prostanoids that may be beneficial. In this proposal, we focus on the
microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), an inducible enzyme that is responsible for the terminal
step of PGE2 biosynthesis in response to various brain insults. The goal of this project is to evaluate the
feasibility of pharmacologically blocking mPGES-1 by novel, brain-penetrant, cross-species, small-molecule
inhibitors to mitigate OPs-triggered brain damage and long-term behavioral comorbidities in animals following
exposure to diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), the prototypical OP. Upon successful completion of this project,
we will have established a proof of concept for mPGES-1 inhibition as an effective delayed countermeasure
against the neurological sequela of cholinergic receptor hyperstimulation caused by OP agents. Anticipated
results will justify future studies on the lead optimization, efficacy, safety, and combined treatment, aiming to
develop novel therapies for OP-based nerve agents-triggered long-term neurotoxicity and functional deficits."
10837487,"The goal of the current proposal is to determine the role of monocyte Delta like-4 (Dll4) in cerebral small vessel
disease (CSVD) and its impact on cognition in people with HIV (PWH). Dll4 is a Notch ligand usually restricted
in endothelial cells (ECs). However, monocytes can express DII4 under pro-inflammatory conditions. This is
relevant to the current era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), where persistent systemic inflammation
is a driving force for the progression of comorbidities.
 Our preliminary data strongly suggest that DII4-Notch signaling is implicated in altering cerebrovascular
function. In vitro, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (often increased in HIV infection) induce a robust increase of Dll4 expression in
human monocytes and Dll4 secretion (extracellular Dll4, exDll4) from monocytes. Monocytes with high Dll4
expression trigger Notch1 activation to promote a pro-inflammatory status. In vivo, mice injected with exDll4
show impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebrovascular remodeling. Of interest, exDll4 inhibits Notch1
activation in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and Notch2/ 3 activation in human brain
vascular smooth muscle cells (HBVSMCs).
 In clinical specimens, we have found sex differences in exDII4 plasma levels of PWH on cART, elevated in
males but not in females compared to HIV uninfected study participants. However, membrane-bound DII4 levels
were similar in males and females, suggesting novel pathways that may contribute to the previously reported
sex differences in cerebrovascular disease. Based on the observations above, we hypothesize that monocyte
DII4-Notch signaling contributes to a monocyte pro-inflammatory phenotype in both male and female PWH. Pro-
inflammatory monocytes are more likely to interact with endothelial cells (ECs) and cross the BBB differentiating
in perivascular macrophages, thus contributing to neuroinflammation and CSVD. In addition, male PWH have
increased levels of exDII4 in circulation, which could further affect the BBB through inhibition of Notch1 signaling
in ECs and Notch3 signaling in pericytes. exDII4 also increases vascular remodeling in small arteries and
arterioles, leading to ischemia as reflected by lacunae and white matter hyperintensities, typical manifestations
of CSVD. We will test these hypotheses by addressing the three aims listed below:
 Aim 1. To determine, in a longitudinal study, the role of monocytes derived DII4 in brain microcirculation
and microstructure integrity.
 Aim 2. To determine, in an integrated approach, the effects of HIV status, imaging metrics, exDII4, and
mDII4 levels on cognitive performance.
 Aim 3. To define the role of mDll4 on molecular mechanisms of monocyte transmigration and the
mechanistic role of exDll4 on vascular cell function."

 Despite concerted efforts to develop an effective vaccine over the last 40 years, the HIV pandemic
remains a profound global public health challenge, with 75 million people infected and an estimated 32 million
deaths from AIDS-related illnesses since 19811. The discovery of patient-derived broadly-neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs) has raised hopes that the immune system is capable of producing antibodies that might
prevent HIV-1 infection2. However, efforts to elicit similar antibodies through vaccination schemes have been
stymied, likely due to the combination of requirements for rare precursors, extensive somatic hypermutation
(SHM), and uncommon heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) lengths in previously
targeted bnAbs2.
 Recently, a novel epitope centered on the heavily glycosylated “silent face” (SF) of gp120 was found to
be targeted by multiple antibodies derived from different germlines that were capable of cross-clade
neutralization of tier 1, 2, and 3 HIV-1 viruses3–5. Importantly, the two glycans that form a majority of the SF
epitope are >85% conserved, suggesting that antibodies targeting this epitope can in theory achieve
neutralization breadths comparable to bNAbs against the highly-conserved CD4 binding site. Importantly, the
relatively limited SHM (~20% amino acid) and ability to arise from multiple germlines in different donors
suggests that SF-targeting antibodies may represent a more achievable target for elicitation via
germline-targeting vaccination approaches; additionally, these antibodies also possess a complementary
breadth and potency to the more well studied V3-targeting bnAbs making them an attractive addition to a
potential poly-epitope targeted vaccine immunogen.
 Thus, the central goal of this proposal is to develop HIV-1 Envelope (Env) trimer immunogens
capable of binding to the inferred germline versions of SF-targeting antibodies in vitro, which we
hypothesize will be capable of eliciting a primary B cell response to the SF epitope in vivo. To test this
hypothesis, I will (i) use yeast display to select for gp120 mutations that improve binding to SF-targeting
germlines, (ii) express these mutations in stabilized trimeric Env immunogens to decorate nanoparticle vectors,
and (iii) vaccinate knock-in mice transgenic for SF inferred germlines and characterize the naïve human B cell
response to our germline-targeting immunogens.
 The long-term goal of this work is to validate the SF epitope as a target for germline-targeting vaccine
approaches. Further outcomes include a better understanding of the germlines capable of responding to this
epitope, which could help guide further rational immunogen design for an HIV vaccine."

Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel
mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple
organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained
unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic
extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to
take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in
biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’).
We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and
mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes
in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses
will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce
significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of
ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic
graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the
peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately
predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic
graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into
a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions
between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new
mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as
a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with
established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict
outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1)
Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic
understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different
scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm
development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored
variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH
that may also translate to other liver diseases."

Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is the current standard of care for first-line
therapy for EGFR mutant lung cancer patients. While osimertinib is effective in inducing tumor regressions,
improving quality of life and prolonging survival in most patients, it is not curative. Early studies of acquired
resistance suggest that even after standard histologic and genomic assessments for resistance mechanisms, a
substantial portion of osimertinib resistance remains uncharacterized. This incomplete understanding of
osimertinib resistance poses a significant barrier to developing new and effective therapies for clinical use. We
hypothesize that, in contrast to earlier generation EGFR inhibitors, non-genomic mechanisms are driving the
majority of acquired resistance to first-line osimertinib. To date, assessments of EGFR TKI acquired resistance
mechanisms have focused on genomic resistance mutations, amplifications, and fusions, in part because these
can be readily detected in tumor tissue or in blood-based ctDNA liquid biopsies. In this project we seek to
discover the spectrum of non-genomic osimertinib resistance. Our main objective is to identify both tumor intrinsic
mechanisms of osimertinib resistance as well as tumor extrinsic microenvironmental resistance mechanisms. In
Aim 1, we will use RARE-Seq, a novel blood-based assay to quantify tumor gene expressions patterns of
resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients relapsing on osimertinib. In Aim 2, we will investigate tumor cell
extrinsic mechanisms of osimertinib resistance by leveraging our robust translational infrastructure to develop
cancer-associated fibroblast models from osimertinib resistance biopsies. We will use these models to dissect
functional interactions between CAFs, tumor cells and immune cells, and we will integrate these results with
spatial molecular analysis of clinical biopsies. Collectively, the studies described in this proposal will generate a
comprehensive picture of osimertinib resistance and set the stage for future development of therapies that
overcome resistance to osimertinib."
10851766,"The overarching goal of this work is to improve treatments of medication-resistant neuropsychiatric diseases with
repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) by tailoring the target to an individual's brain networks. We are indeed in
critical need of these individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans
during our lifetimes, and brain stimulation treatments, including rTMS represent innovative approaches for these
patients. To alleviate depression, rTMS attempts to target a region of the prefrontal cortex generally located within
the central executive network (CEN), which drives decision making, cognitive control, and is critically impaired in
depression. However, rTMS is delivered without targeting an individual's CEN, and as such may inadvertently
deliver stimulation outside the CEN. This application is motivated by recent developments in the field, including a
large-scale whole-brain connectivity database derived from invasive recordings and the demonstration that rTMS
in depressed patients induces brain changes that predict clinical improvement. In this proposal, we combine non-
invasive TMS studies in healthy subjects and depressed patients with invasive direct stimulation studies from
surgical patients. We test the hypothesis that the CEN connectivity is weakened in depression and can be
maximally modulated by individualizing localization. The project consists of three aims: (1) investigate the
excitability, connectivity, and neuronal properties within the CEN using direct brain recordings in surgical patients
with epilepsy; (2) derive accurate TMS tools to measure CEN connectivity non-invasively in healthy and depressed
populations; and (3) in a depressed population characterize inter-individual variability within the CEN and
prospectively test if localization with TMS at the individual level more effectively modulates this brain network. This
approach, which can be generalized to any brain region and disorder, utilizes a large database of direct brain
recordings to map a brain network at an unparalleled level of detail, develops a link to direct brain recordings in
order to yield validated non-invasive brain measures, and applies these insights to individually localize the network
and improve targeted brain stimulation. Scientific outcomes include: (1) the first causal, functional map of the
human CEN from direct brain recordings; (2) novel non-invasive brain measures of connectivity grounded in
electrophysiology; (3) causal brain signatures of depression in the CEN; (4) a methodology to target an individual's
CEN in the clinic; and (5) improved modulation of the CEN using this methodology. In summary, a successful
outcome of the proposed work would yield an algorithm and guidelines for personalized TMS targeting based on
fully validated brain signatures in depression.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Brain stimulation for depression targets the central executive network (CEN), involved in decision making and
cognitive control, core in depression, and difficult to target in the clinic. Here we propose to study the connectivity
of the CEN using a combination of invasive and non-invasive brain recordings; we will 1) investigate CEN
connectivity from direct brain recordings, 2) derive accurate and causal tools to measure CEN connectivity non-
invasively in healthy and depressed populations, and 3) test if CEN localization at the individual level can more
effectively modulate this network. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield an algorithm and
guidelines for personalized TMS targeting based on fully validated brain signatures in depression."

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Nearly a third of patients with non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) present with potentially resectable early-stage NSCLC. Despite complete resection,
approximately 50% of patients with stage II and III NSCLC recur and die from metastatic NSCLC. There are no
reliable biomarkers to predict poor outcomes in early-stage NSCLC. Molecularly targeted therapies and
immune checkpoint blockade targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
have significantly improved the outcomes of patients with metastatic NSCLC, and these agents are now
undergoing clinical trials in early-stage lung cancer following standard therapy. The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) has launched an ambitious multicenter study, the Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker
Identification and Sequencing (ALCHEMIST), to screen nearly 8000 patients with completely resected NSCLC
to identify those with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK)
and rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) to investigate the role of erlotinib and crizotinib,
respectively. Those with tumors lacking EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement were offered participation in a
randomized trial comparing nivolumab, an inhibitor of PD-1 to observation. The ALCHEMIST Genomics
Working Group is planning to study the tumor whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes from nearly 2000
patients who did not participate in the intervention trials (ALCHEMIST Screening Study) and all those enrolled
in the three ALCHEMIST therapeutic trials. This suite of trials with data generated using genomic analyses
provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of the cancer proteome in predicting outcomes in patients
with resected NSCLC. We propose a Proteogenomic Translational Research Center (PTRC) to study the
proteogenomic alterations in resected early-stage NSCLC co-led by the Washington University School of
Medicine (WUSM) and the Broad Institute along with investigators affiliated with the NCI-funded National
Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) supporting the ALCHEMIST suite of clinical trials. Our overarching objective is
to apply mass spectrometry-based global and targeted proteomic analyses to patient-derived resected tumor
material to improve upon the predictive biomarkers using somatic cancer genome and transcriptome and
clinical characteristics. These discoveries will be translated into targeted assays to predict recurrence
following therapy. Since the ALCHEMIST Crizotinib study is still ongoing and has enrolled relatively fewer
patients compared to other studies, we will not include those samples in this proposal. The three aims of this
project are to develop prognostic assessment tools to predict relapse in patients with resected NSCLC treated
with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy (aim 1), standard platinum doublet chemotherapy and nivolumab
(aim 2), and standard platinum doublet chemotherapy and erlotinib (aim 3) using proteogenomics."

 Despite strong consensus that early, specialized intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) can have a dramatic impact on outcomes, the U.S. health system’s capacity to provide such services is
severely challenged by the rapid rise in ASD prevalence. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes for
children with early signs of ASD by increasing the capacity to provide appropriately specialized treatment
within an existing infrastructure: the Part C Early Intervention (EI) service delivery system. Part C is publicly
funded, available in all areas, and serves children under age 3 who have developmental delays or disabilities.
Currently, the effectiveness of EI services is limited by high practice variation and infrequent use of evidence-
based interventions. The study objective is to improve services and outcomes for children with early signs of
ASD by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of training EI providers to
deliver Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT). RIT is a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI)
that is ideally suited for EI settings because it is low intensity, play-based, easy to learn and implement, and
can be taught to families for their independent use, thus increasing intervention dosage.
 This RCT will employ a hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation design, and will use a unique mixed
methods approach to gather evidence that will be essential for implementing RIT at scale, pending positive trial
results. The sample includes 20 EI agencies across 4 U.S. States and comprises a total of 160 EI providers
and 440 families of children with early symptoms of ASD, which not only provides a robust sample size, but
also affords the opportunity to assess generalizability of this approach across regions that vary in their
implementation of Part C services. EI providers will be randomly assigned to the RIT training group (n=80) or
treatment as usual (TAU; n=80). Providers in both groups will identify 2-5 children in their caseload who are
16-30 months old with early symptoms of ASD (n=220 children per group). Intensive, state-of-the art, multi-
method assessment technology will be used to measure the impact of the intervention on children’s language
and social communication, as well as parents’ self-efficacy and well-being. Importantly, this study will examine
putative mechanisms (i.e., child gains in imitation and joint attention; parent contingent responsiveness)
through which the intervention improves clinically-relevant outcomes. Data regarding provider-initiated
modifications to the intervention and delivery will be analyzed to identify fidelity-consistent vs. fidelity-
inconsistent changes, which will inform refinement of future RIT training and quality assurance procedures. In
sum, this study will generate the evidence necessary to implement RIT at scale, thereby increasing the
capacity of the existing EI system to deliver effective, evidence-based intervention to the rapidly growing
population of children who show early signs of ASD."
10838456,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is a group of progressive optic neuropathies that together are leading causes of irreversible vision
loss. The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to its hallmark, progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, are
unknown, but key risk factors include increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Vision loss often persists with
current IOP-lowering treatments, thus urgent needs exist both for better understanding of glaucomatous
mechanisms and improved glaucoma therapies other than IOP reduction. Based on our clinical findings that
vision is preserved markedly longer in dogs with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) caused by spontaneous
mutation of the matrix metalloproteinase-encoding gene ADAMTS10 than in dogs with other forms of
glaucoma, and our novel biomechanical findings, I hypothesize that inter-individual differences in
biomechanical effects of IOP on optic nerve head (ONH) contribute strongly to glaucoma progression and
individuals' differential susceptibilities to it. My long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic approaches to
modify ONH and scleral biomechanics, to permit and improve preservation of optic nerve (ON) and RGC
function in glaucoma patients. This multidisciplinary, collaborative translational study will test the central
hypothesis that ADAMTS10-mutant individuals have high compliance of ONH, peripapillary sclera, and
extracellular matrix (ECM) preceding and during glaucoma development, that protects ON axons even when
IOP is chronically elevated. Specific Aims: Using clinically-relevant translational canine chronic glaucoma
models, including ADAMTS10-OAG, I propose 3 Aims: In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that that ADAMTS10
mutation mitigates IOP-induced ON damage. In Aims 2 and 3, I will test the hypotheses that ONH and
peripapillary sclera in eyes with ADAMTS10-OAG (Aim 2: tissue level) and the peripapillary scleral fibroblasts,
astrocytes, and lamina cribrosa (LC) cells, and their ECM exhibit more compliant properties (Aim 3: cellular
and ECM level). In addition, in Aim 3, I will test if ECM derived from ADAMTS10-mutant LC cells and
peripapillary scleral fibroblasts modulates biomechanical properties of non-mutant cells. Significance: Based
on extensive preliminary data and using large animal spontaneous glaucoma models, we will provide the first
test of the effects of inherently-altered biomechanical properties of peripapillary sclera and ONH, and their
potential interactions with elevated IOP, in determining the course of glaucoma progression. Innovation: I will
determine 1) novel neuroprotective biomechanical properties of the ONH and peripapillary sclera in glaucoma
in `real disease' models, and 2) compliance of astrocytes, LC cells, scleral fibroblasts, and their ECM and cell-
ECM interactions in pathogenic mechanisms. My innovation includes our novel, well-established cross-
disciplinary collaborative mentoring team with a strong track record in successful translational research in
ocular biomechanics and genetics. Overall, findings from this proposal could introduce new and translatable
therapeutic targets to preserve ON axons in glaucoma."
10838573,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective antidepressant non-invasive brain stimulation
therapies for adults with major depression. However, a number of patients fail to respond despite adequate trials,
and while clinically beneficial, ECT can produce adverse cognitive effects including amnesia, executive
dysfunction, and verbal dysfluency. Previous single- and multi-site ECT-imaging investigations have been limited
by insufficient sample size and/or non-standardization of methodology. Therefore, in answer to NIMH Strategic
Objective 3.2 “Develop strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes,” our investigative
teams have conducted clinical studies to develop standardized methods for acute ECT course administration,
antidepressant and cognitive measures for phenotyping, optimal neuroimaging protocols and E-field modeling,
and sophisticated analytic models to integrate and interpret the antidepressant-response and cognitive-
impairment biomarkers. In this prospective study we propose the first investigation integrating multiple units of
analysis including clinical and cognitive phenotyping, whole-brain neuroimaging, EEG, and E-field modeling to
establish the mechanisms underlying ECT-induced antidepressant response (response biomarkers) and
cognitive adverse effects (safety biomarkers), as well as to find the “sweet spot” of ECT dosing for optimal
antidepressant benefit and cognitive safety. Adult patients with major depressive disorder (n = 230) will receive
a standardized acute ECT course, complete clinical and cognitive measures and undergo structural and
functional MRI at three time points (baseline, after ECT #6, and following treatment completion) and one-month
naturalistic follow-up. All MRI data will be processed and harmonized identically at a central imaging core to
ensure uniformity. We have three primary aims: 1) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, ictal
power, and biomarkers; 2) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and antidepressant
outcomes; and 3) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and cognitive outcomes. An
exploratory aim will contrast antidepressant-response and cognitive-impairment biomarkers identified in the
current proposal with magnetic seizure therapy and healthy comparison subjects. The overarching hypothesis
of this investigation is that the E-field variability will explain antidepressant and cognitive outcomes.
Public Health Significance: Successful completion of this project will verify the optimal ECT dose (the “sweet
spot”) of 112 V/m within the right hippocampus which can then inform precision and individualization of ECT
amplitude with “E-field informed ECT”. The standardized algorithms for E-field modeling can be generalized and
widely disseminated. This proposal will result in a paradigm shift from “trial and error” approaches of ECT
parameter selection to individualized, precision dosing to improve patient outcomes."

Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral infection to complicate cardiac transplantation and is
an important risk factor for cellular rejection. While CMV causes damage to native organs through direct viral
cytopathic effect, CMV-mediated cardiac allograft rejection is attributed to “immune dysregulation,” the
mechanisms for which are not well understood. This information is critical to the field of transplantation, as
treatment of cellular rejection, even in cases with concurrent CMV viremia, includes immunosuppression, an
approach that confers risk of abrogation of viremic control and precipitation of CMV-related morbidity, including
worsening rejection and other opportunistic infections. While cellular rejection is mediated by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL), recent paradigm-shifting work has demonstrated that activated mononuclear-phagocytic
(MP) cells also have a critical role in driving allograft rejection through trained immunity. These findings are
intriguing in the context of CMV-mediated graft rejection as MP cells are an important CMV viral reservoir. The
central hypothesis being tested in this proposal is that CMV-mediated dysregulation of the MP system triggers a
unique rejection phenotype that drives the infiltration of distinctly proliferative and alloreactive CTL into cardiac
allograft tissue. The objective of this proposal is to leverage multi-omics strategies, including scRNA-seq and
CITE-seq, to decode the allograft tissue microenvironment in rejection during CMV viremia, with a focus on
understanding how MP cells orchestrate alloreactive CTL responses (Aim 1) and determine if tissue MP and
CTL cell states are reflected in the blood (Aim 2). To accomplish this, we will study endomyocardial tissue and
paired blood from a cohort of 200 heart transplant recipients at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
Transplant Center. These studies will distinguish CMV-mediated and CMV-independent mechanisms of cellular
rejection, allowing for the development of diagnostic tools and rejection treatment strategies tailored to viral or
non-viral causes, promoting precision medicine in cardiac transplantation. Dr. Sen will perform the work in this
K08 proposal in the Center for Immunology and Inflammatory diseases (CIID) at MGH under the mentorship of
Dr. Andrew Luster and Dr. Alexandra-Chloe Villani. The CIID is a state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research
center focused on mechanisms of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and is the foundation for
immunology research at MGH. Dr. Sen has devised a career development plan consisting of coursework and
hands-on training in single-cell ‘omics,’ bioinformatics, the biology of alloimmunity and tolerance, cardiac tissue
microenvironments, in vivo host-pathogen interactions, and human subjects research, as well as organized a
Training Advisory Committee, chaired by Dr. Joren Madsen, to provide expertise and assistance in these areas.
The K08 award will provide Dr. Sen with the intellectual and technical training necessary to become an
independent, R01-funded investigator with expertise in host-pathogen interactions and immune dysregulation in
transplantation."
10839379,"As a funded P50 center, the current 1Florida ADRC administrative core has successfully
managed the complex multi-institution collaborations vital to our success. We have also garnered
the additional resources and funds needed to accomplish our infrastructure generating and
scientific goals (e.g., funds for additional pilot proposals, ~300 amyloid PET scans, fellowship
support, and data management support) We are adapting our administrative core structure and
personnel to be responsive to the change in funding mechanism, grant structure, and
programmatic goals. These alterations are designed to support i) the highly synergistic
interactions between all the collaborating institutes, ii) an increased emphasis on education and
training, iii) inclusion of developmental projects, and iv) expansions of clinical core activities to
include cohorts at UF and UM. Of particular note, our expanded leadership group positions the
1Florida ADRC well within our institutions to expand Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s
related dementias (AD+ADRD) research activities. This leadership group also provides a breadth
of AD+ADRD reaserch experience and reflects the broad foci of AD+ADRD research across our
institutions. Four Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Provide the vision, infrastructure, oversight, and
overall compliance needed to function as an effective multi-site ADRC. The Administrative core
will coordinate center activities across institutions and track progress towards goals in a milestone
driven fashion. Aim 2. Manage the request for applications, review and award of developmental
projects. Aim 3. Promote AD+ADRD research and educational activities among our collaborating
institutions and throughout the state. Aim 4. Actively leverage resources from our collaborating
institutions, the State, and other stakeholders to advance AD+ADRD research."
10839380,"The goal of the 1Florida ADRC is to advance the understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and Related Disorders
(ADRDs), especially in underrepresented minority groups. Among 370 participants currently recruited at Mount
Sinai Medical Center (MSMC), 60% are Hispanic, with a retention rate of ~80%, over 50% are normal or have
various stages of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Structural MRI has been obtained on 90% and amyloid PET
(aPET) scans on ~70% of participants (comprising 1/3 of all aPET scans in NACC). Autopsy has been obtained
on over 95% of those consented, including > 50% from Hispanic decedents. Novel neuropsychological
instruments in English and Spanish have been developed and utilized to detect cognitive impairment before it is
detectable by standard assessments. The effects of language, culture, acculturation and bilingualism among
minority groups on cognitive and functional performance, the demographic and genetic factors that affect the
threshold for amyloid positivity and the differential effect of APOE genotype on amyloid load in Hispanics versus
non-Hispanics have been studies in depth.
In the current P30 application, we propose to expand the clinical core to include MSMC as well as University of
Miami (UM), where recruitment and retention of AA participants has been very successful and expertise in
evaluating vascular comorbidities and contributions to dementia exists, and the University of Florida (UF),
Gainesville, where considerable expertise exists in evaluation and studies of Lewy Body Disease (LBD) and
early Parkinson’s disease. In total we propose to recruit 600 participants (~40% Hispanic, ~40% White non-
Hispanic [WNH], and ~20% AA), including 100 new participants at each of three sites and at least 200 follow-
ups at MSMC and 100 follow-ups each at UM and UF. All new participants will receive MRI and aPET scans.
Follow-up participants will also receive repeat MRI scans and most will receive aPET scans. Blood-based
biomarker assessments (Aβ42:40, NFL, and others) will be used to complement the imaging and
neuropsychological assessments.
Clinical Core activities will be integrated closely with ORE, REC, Biomarker and Pathology Cores, and
harmonized across the three clinical sites with respect to consistency of assessments, biospecimens, biomarker
studies, standardized implementation of all NACC modules, LBD and vascular assessments diagnostic
methodology. Utilization of elements of the NIA-AA Research Framework ATN classification (Amyloid, Tau,
Neurodegeneration) will be implemented. Methods and metrics will be used to ensure full integration between
the sites, including recruitment and enrollment for brain autopsies, which will be done at all three sites, with
correlation of imaging findings to regional brain pathology and structural changes. Qualified investigators and
the larger ADRD community will receive access to Clinical Core participants and their data and biospecimens
for research projects and education, training purposes."
10839382,"Summary/Abstract: Data Management and Statistical Core, 1Florida ADRC
The Data Management and Statistical Core of the 1Florida ADRC functions as key connective fiber that links
the various cores of the center, provides the principal point of contact with internal and external investigators and
trainees, and is the primary conduit to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), both for the delivery
of data, and for the acquisition of data sets for local investigators. The Core also exists to ensure rigor and
reproducibility at every step of data handling, from entry and coding, through analysis and dissemination.
Consistent with the central themes of the 1Florida ADRC, the Core (a) consolidates, de-identifies and provides
biomarker data to investigators, (b) puts particular emphasis on data analysis methods for longitudinal analysis,
particularly in supporting and educating early career investigators in their use, (c) supports biomedical informatics
and e-health investigators in accessing and using large data repositories (e.g., the One Florida Data Trust) for
development of novel hypotheses regarding dementias. The core also provides leadership in the collaborative
development of open source applications for the coding and transmission of data. Aims of the Core include:
(1) providing high quality data management processes and systems to data that has been validated,
integrated/merged (across Center operations), is secure, well documented, and shared with other investigators
locally and nationally;
(2) providing up-to-date data analysis consultation in a) study design, b) selection of study measures, c) data
analysis, d) interpretation of findings, and e) presentation, before, during and after data collection and analysis.
The core also ensures rigor and reproducibility of 1Florida ADRC research by supporting (a) pre-registration of
manuscripts, (b) use of reproducible and open source code for data analyses, (c) use of preprint publication of
manuscripts for wide dissemination and “open peer review”.
(3) supporting the larger community of ADRC investigators nationally, and those affiliated with the 1Florida
ADRC, with open source data management tools and applications; as well as with
42 online training modules (with practice data sets and code), via the Research Education Component, in
methods ranging from simple descriptive to advance growth and survival models."
10839383,"In order to support the goals of the 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC) the 
Neuropathology Core will perform diagnostic evaluations and quantitative analyses of the brains collected from 
deceased individuals that participate in the clinical studies. A definite diagnosis of AD still requires a thorough 
post-mortem evaluation. We will coordinate storage of biospecimens including blood plasma, serum, DNA, and 
CSF and their distribution in response to request from qualified investigators inside and outside the 1Florida 
ADRC. The specific aims of the Neuropathology Core are: Aim 1 Conduct a thorough post-mortem CNS 
examination in accordance to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association consensus guidelines of ~25 
ADRC subjects/year followed longitudinally in the Clinical Core with consent and establish a neuropathological 
diagnosis for each patient. Aim 2 Provide neuropathologic data to be included in the database using support 
from the Data Management and Statistical (DMS) Core and provide ADRC data in concert with the Clinical 
Core. Neuropathological data will be provided to the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) through 
the Data Management and Statistical Core Aim 3 Collect and maintain a bank of archived unfixed frozen and 
fixed tissue, DNA, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and plasma from ADRC patients with AD, MCI, preMCI or 
other related neurodegenerative diseases, along with CN controls and distribute these samples to qualified 
investigators within the ADRC and external investigators upon request. Aim 4 Be responsive to changing needs 
in tissue acquisition and processing to support new scientific studies and provide consultation regrading 
appropriate experimental design for neuropathology studies in both human samples and mouse models of 
various inclusion pathologies relevant to neurodegenerative disorders. Aim 5 Execute clinical pathologic case 
conferences, brain cutting and other activities supporting research training activities and ensure integration with 
other Cores within the 1Florida ADRC. Final diagnoses will be achieved by clinical-pathological consensus 
conferences to be held quarterly with the Clinical Core, which will serve as an important educational component 
that will integrate with the Research Education Component. These activities of this Core are all critical functions 
of an ADRC."
10859678,"Project Summary/Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a debilitating disorder that includes chronic seizures and pervasive memory
impairments that significantly impact quality of life. In rodent models of TLE, my lab and others have found
dramatic changes in brain synchronization with specific changes in the theta phase locking of individual
interneurons of the dentate gyrus. However, it remains unclear whether this abnormal phase locking is a
causal mediator of seizures and cognitive deficits in epilepsy. In order to test whether the timing of interneuron
activity is directly controlling epileptic phenotypes, we have developed a novel closed-loop optogenetic system
to control the timing of interneuron activity during behavior. In this proposal, we will use our closed-loop
optogenetic system to shift the phase locking of parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons and
determine how the timing of these interneurons alters seizure susceptibility and cognitive performance. In
control mice, we will force an abnormal firing pattern onto the interneurons and determine whether this can
drive increased seizure susceptibility and impair cognition. In epileptic mice, we will use optogenetics to
normalize the timing of interneuron activity and determine whether this can reduce seizure susceptibility and
rescue memory impairments. Together, these experiments will determine how the timing of interneuron activity
mediates seizures and cognitive deficits in epilepsy."
10863597,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA vaccines have quicker development timelines and are simpler to manufacture than traditional vaccines.
Combining this strength of RNA technology with protein engineering, they hold the potential to generate highly
efficacious vaccines rapidly that can target and harness the immune system to counter their target virus. Further,
since they can be rapidly synthesized, modifications can be made to maintain efficacy even when the target virus
may undergo mutation in the population. Finally, as RNA vaccines are transient in the vaccinee, do not
incorporate into the genome or require nuclear delivery, and do not encode an entire pathogen, they have a
lower risk profile than other genetic immunization strategies. Therefore, a major component of this application is
to generate efficacious RNA vaccine candidates. To accomplish this development (Aim1), our core will support
Projects 1-3 by generating RNA for their potential engineering and screening. Once a lead antigen is selected,
we will generate both mRNA and self-amplifying replicon mRNA (repRNA) encoding the same antigens to
compare the safety and effectiveness of the immune response to the two different RNA vaccine platforms. To
continue to innovate (Aim 2) and improve our mRNA and repRNA platforms to reduce reactogenicity, increase
stability, and enhance translational efficiency of the RNA constructs, we will prepare antigen gene sequences
with alternative, artificial intelligence-guided codon usage, and incorporate novel lipids into our lipid
nanoparticles. Finally, we can assist our colleagues to make the transition from research to GLP studies by
generating clinical grade RNA constructs in support of rigorous pre-clinical studies."

G-RISE at UMBC will provide comprehensive financial support in years 1 and 2. Competitive funding can be
obtained in year 3 of the program based on the assessment of mentor/mentee proposals to advance research
while enabling the trainee to acquire skills and experience relevant to career interests. Students will be recruited
regionally and nationally through outreach activities, participation in recruitment events, social media presence,
and presentations at scientific conferences. Recruitment will be carried out in a holistic manner, as a joint effort
between the participating departments and the G-RISE team. Retention, which is already very high, will be
maintained at current levels. The G-RISE program will enhance career development through individualized
mentoring. Trainees will enroll in the required Summer Bridge to enhance writing skills and facilitate transition
into graduate school. Trainees will also complete a course on the Responsible Conduct of Research and attend
several workshops: career exposure, grant-writing, quantitative skills, and transition into the workplace. They will
also participate in community-building activities, monthly meetings, and annual retreats. In addition, trainees will
have the opportunity to carry out elective, hands-on training and take on additional coursework to prepare them
for careers of interest. Faculty mentors will be expected to participate in mentor training and G-RISE- sponsored
activities that seek to promote an inclusive environment. The efficacy of the program will be monitored regularly
by analysis of performance and trainee and alumni surveys."

This application is for the competitive renewal of our current R01 grant titled “Regulatory B cells in the
amelioration of immune-mediated periodontal disease”. Our current studies have focused on the anti-
inflammatory role of B10 cells in periodontal disease tissue destruction and inflammatory bone resorption.
Specifically, we demonstrated that B10 cells can be activated and expanded following triggering by specific TLR
signaling and co-stimulatory molecules and thereby inhibit local inflammation and bone loss in experimental
periodontitis in vivo. The observed anti-inflammatory effects are associated with IL-10 secretion by B10 cells.
While substantiating the anti-inflammatory actions of these cells, the potential role of B10 cells in the resolution
phase of inflammation is largely unknown. Our recent data using multiphoton intravital microscopy demonstrated
co-localization of monocytes/ macrophages with transferred B10 cells in gingival tissue of LPS-induced gingivitis.
Co-culture of activated B10 cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with human monocytic
cell line (THP-1)-differentiated macrophages up-regulated PD-1 expression by macrophages and production of
specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM). These effects were diminished when direct contact between B10
and macrophages was blocked. Together with the previously published findings by others, we hypothesize that
i) activated B10 cells induce pro-resolving macrophage differentiation and specialized pro-resolving
mediators (SPM) production via PD-L1/PD-1 ligation, and ii) that actions of SPM derived from B10-
macrophage interaction enhance both B10 cell differentiation to antibody-secreting cells and pro-
resolving macrophage function to promote inflammation resolution and alleviate periodontal bone loss.
In this proposal, we will first determine the role of PD-L1/PD-1 ligation on B10-mediated regulation of
macrophage phenotype switch and production of lipid mediators using B10-macrophage co-cultures and
adoptive B10 cell transfer (Aim 1); The actions of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) on B10
differentiation during B10-macrophage interaction will be determined, together with their effects on B cell-
mediated pathogen clearance, and inhibition of gingival inflammation and periodontal bone loss (Aim 2); Lastly,
B10-macrophage interaction on pro-resolving macrophages function, neutrophil activity, and the subsequent
resolution of periodontal inflammation will be determined (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project will
generate conceptual advances in our understanding of the immune regulatory cell interactions and their impact
on the resolution of inflammation. If our hypothesis is correct, the studies will broaden our insights into possible
role of immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1/PD-1 in inflammation resolution in periodontal disease, as well as
other immune-mediated osteolytic conditions such as osteoporosis or rheumatoid arthritis."
10830935,"Abstract
 The complex and prolonged disease course exhibited by Parkinson’s disease (PD) first starts with non-motor
disturbances and then slowly progresses to mild-to-moderate motor deficits, ultimately inflicting severe motor
and cognitive deficits. Although pathophysiological mechanisms underlying various stages of the disease have
yet to be characterized, both mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) and neural oxidative stress (OS) have been
identified as key pathological correlates in the progressive neurodegenerative process in PD. While studying key
oxidative signaling mechanisms that regulate susceptibility of the nigrostriatal dopamin(DA)ergic system to MD
and oxidative damage, we unexpectedly discovered that protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is highly expressed in nigral
DAergic neurons and that the kinase is rapidly activated during the early stages of oxidative insult to protect
DAergic neurons against oxidative damage. Our mechanistic studies revealed that activated PKD1 rapidly
translocates to both mitochondria and the nucleus of DAergic neurons. Our preliminary studies show that
activated PKD1 likely enhances the transcription of key neuro-adaptive oxidative mechanisms involving
enhanced PGC1-α, TFAM and BDNF signaling pathways. Thus, the goal of this study is to elucidate
mitochondrial/nuclear events governing the PKD1-mediated compensatory protective response using cell and
animal models of PD. The overarching hypothesis of our proposal is that the pro-survival kinase PKD1 is rapidly
activated in nigral DAergic neurons during the initial stage of an oxidative insult and quickly translocates to
mitochondria and nuclei to initiate cell survival signaling pathways. Its nuclear translocation initiates key pro-
survival transcriptional machinery responsible for PGC1-α, TFAM and BDNF upregulation, leading to enhanced
mitochondrial biogenesis and neurotrophic support in DAergic neurons. Mitochondrial translocation of PKD1
improves mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial quality control (MQC). Thus, PKD1 serves as a key
‘compensatory adaptive switch’ in nigral DAergic neurons. To test this, we will systematically pursue the following
specific aims: (i) characterize PKD1 activation and nuclear/mitochondrial translocation and its functional
relevance in cell culture and animal models of PD; (ii) characterize the downstream pro-survival signaling
pathways activated by PKD1 mitochondrial/nuclear translocation in DAergic neurons; and (iii) validate PKD1 as
a therapeutic target of PD and examine the translational potential of a novel PKD1 activator. We will use multiple
model systems and state-of-the-art cellular, histological and neurochemical approaches to achieve these specific
aims. Our multifaceted approach to harness the PKD1 adaptive signaling mechanisms that promote DAergic
neuronal survival will enable us to devise a novel translational strategy capable of intervening early in the course
of disease progression in PD."

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and also the leading cause of serious long-term disability in the
United States. About 87% of all strokes are classified as ischemic, which occurs as a result of an
obstruction within a blood vessel supplying oxygen-rich blood to an area of the brain. Despite the efficacy
and safety of thrombolysis (by tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA) and thrombectomy (by surgery), most
patients are ineligible for treatment due to the narrow time-window. Thus, ischemic stroke is a huge unmet
medical need; it's imperative to identify new stroke therapeutic targets. Swelling of astrocytes and neurons
is a pathological hallmark of many neurological diseases, including ischemic stroke and traumatic brain
injury. How it contributes to the pathogenesis remains unclear. Cell swelling activates the Volume-
Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC), which typically facilitates regulatory volume decrease by mediating
efflux of chloride and organic osmolytes, followed by release of osmotically obligated water. However,
persistent VRAC activation in the brain is thought to be detrimental. For example, VRAC has been
proposed to be a major pathway for the excessive glutamate release from swollen astrocytes, which over-
stimulates neuronal NMDA receptors and causes excitotoxicity. Despite intense research in 3 decades,
the molecular identity of VRAC was a longstanding mystery. Due to this gap, the previous evidence
supporting VRAC's pathological role was mainly based on nonspecific pharmacological inhibitors. We
developed an innovative high-throughput assay and through a genome-wide RNAi screen, have
successfully identified a novel membrane protein SWELL1 (LRRC8A) as the only essential VRAC subunit.
Our preliminary data showed that Swell1-dependent VRAC in astrocytes directly releases glutamate,
which enhances neuronal excitability. Importantly, Swell1 astrocyte-specific KO mice were significantly
protected from brain damage in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) stroke model. This
proposed research program will combine innovative approaches including cell and acute brain slice
electrophysiology, live cell imaging, high-throughput chemical screening, cell-type specific KO mouse
models, and in vivo experimental stroke models to elucidate the important role of the cell swelling-
activated chloride channel in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Completion of the proposed study will
establish Swell1 channel as a key pathological mediator in stroke and provide a new “druggable” ion
channel target for not only stroke, but also other neurological disease associated with abnormal cell
swelling."

Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in the access, utilization, and quality of mental health care.
People with disabilities face further intersecting disadvantages and access barriers. Improving access
and quality of mental health services for disadvantaged groups requires an understanding of factors at
multiple levels as well as an understanding of how these factors interact. A key gap in our knowledge is
how structural factors, such as the landscape and the organization of providers, affect access,
utilization, and quality of mental health care for disadvantaged groups. This project investigates the
effect of the provider landscape on disparities by race, ethnicity and disability status in access,
utilization and the quality of mental health care. We will combine multiple large insurance claims
datasets from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurers as well as novel provider organization and
ownership data in order to characterize patterns and changes in the provider landscape for mental
health care. We will use quasi-experimental approaches to identify the differential causal effects of the
provider landscape on access, utilization, and quality of care for different groups. These quasi-
experiments include changes in provider ownership structure, provider exits, and individuals moving to
areas with different provider landscapes. We will also use quasi-experimental approaches to study how
changes in Medicaid policy that may have differentially altered the provider landscape for mental health
care across racial, ethnic and disability status groups. By identifying structural aspects of the health
care system that reduce or increase disparities in mental health care, our findings will reveal targets for
policy interventions to improve the mental health of disadvantaged populations across the U.S."

 2 Native Hawaiian individuals represent one of the most underserved and understudied populations in US
 3 healthcare and medical research. However, this population is one of the fastest growing in the US and faces
 4 alarming long-standing health disparities, with approximately 30% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, 100%
 5 higher risk of diabetes and gout, and 400% higher risk of stroke compared to White individuals. Obesity and high
 6 body mass index (BMI) are known to increase risk for these conditions, and notably, an estimated 41% of Native
 7 Hawaiians are obese compared to 21% of White individuals. Native Hawaiians are characterized predominantly
 8 by Polynesian, European, and East Asian ancestries, and higher Polynesian ancestries in Native Hawaiians
 9 have been linked to higher risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure, as well as higher BMI and
10 subcutaneous and visceral fat, even after accounting for socioeconomic and smoking status. Despite Native
11 Hawaiians sharing East Asian ancestry with Japanese individuals, the burden of some of these conditions are
12 lower in Japanese Americans. As many of these health disparities are cardiometabolic in nature, the objective
13 of this research is to evaluate circulating metabolomic profiles in Native Hawaiians and Japanese Americans,
14 given their complementary risk profiles, to illuminate the underlying mechanisms contributing to health disparities
15 in these populations. This will be accomplished by establishing a large-scale high throughput metabolomic
16 resource in 2,000 Native Hawaiian and 1,000 Japanese American participants from the Multiethnic Cohort. In
17 Aim 1, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and evaluate genetic ancestry to investigate
18 the contribution of genetics to metabolite variation. In Aim 2, we will conduct metabolome-wide association
19 studies to identify metabolites associated with cardiometabolic and other health-related traits presenting health
20 disparities in Native Hawaiians. In Aim 3, we will investigate potentially causal metabolic mechanisms impacting
21 health-related traits, leveraging the full sample of 5,660 Native Hawaiian and 24,485 Japanese MEC participants
22 with GWAS data, along with GWAS summary statistics from >14,000 Pacific Islander and >214,000 Japanese
23 participants across multiple studies. Findings from this investigation are expected to substantially improve our
24 understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to cardiometabolic and other health-related conditions
25 presenting health disparities in Native Hawaiian and Japanese American populations, which will ultimately
26 contribute to novel means to reducing these disparities. This study will also importantly bolster innovative
27 epidemiologic research to address major knowledge gaps and health disparities in populations that are
28 understudied and when included in research, often studied in aggregate, masking the ability to identify distinct
29 etiologic factors.
PROJECT SUMMARY"
10831492,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Newborn screening (NBS) has been of incalculable benefit to infants since its inception in the 1960s. The
laudable goal of NBS programs has been to identify infants who will develop lethal or debilitating childhood
disorders at a time when they are pre-symptomatic and when treatment is maximally effective. However,
problems with the accuracy of the diagnostic paradigms for screened disorders represent a potential source of
harm to infants and parents alike. Excessive false positive rates of some newborn screens, which cause
insufficiently high positive predictive values (PPVs), contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. This uncertainty can
lead to 1) a delay in diagnosis and worsening of treatment outcomes, and 2) morbidity and mortality resulting
from unnecessary treatment. Furthermore, significant parental anxiety needlessly accompanies false positive
NBS results. The broad goal of the current application is to improve the accuracy of NBS for Krabbe disease
(KD), Pompe disease (PD), and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPSI). During our recently completed R21
grant, it was established that for KD, an approach to NBS consisting of the development of bivariate normal
limits (BVNL) for the amounts of two biomarkers, psychosine (PSY) and the enzyme galactocerebrosidase
(GalC), in newborn dried blood spots (DBS) can predict symptoms before they occur. Retrospective testing of
this tool resulted in a very high PPV of 98.5%, essentially eliminating the existing false positive problem for KD.
(KD screening in New York State resulted in 1.4 % PPV.) Preliminary studies indicate that BVNL tools, with
PPVs approaching 100%, can also be developed for MPSI and PD.
This proposal will test novel BVNL tools for KD, MPSI, and PD using specific NBS biomarkers, and will assess
these tools for effective pre-symptomatic identification of these disorders. Aim 1a will prospectively collect
results of PSY and GalC from DBS of infants who screen positively for KD in New York, Ohio, Missouri, and
metropolitan Chicago, Illinois. These areas, as well as Gifu, Osaka, and Shimane, Japan (where only data for
MPSI will be collected), comprise the proposed Bivariate Analysis for Newborn Screening (BANS) Network of
collaborating genetics referral sites. This acronym reflects the anticipated use of BVNL tools in an approach
that eliminates the potential harm of excessive false positives after NBS of KD, PD and MPSI. Aim 1b will
utilize the BANS Network for prospective monitoring of infants who have screened positive for KD to determine
whether application of the BVNL tool to their pre-symptomatically collected blood spots predicts subsequent
symptom emergence. Aim 2 will utilize the BANS network and newborn blood spots obtained from the Virtual
Repository of Dried Blood Spots to further develop BVNL tools for MPSI and PD. Aim 3 will again employ the
BANS Network to prospectively determine the predictive capacity of the BVNL tools for MPSI and PD. If the
improved prediction of KD, MPSI, and PD after NBS is achieved, treatment will be enhanced for these
devastating illnesses, and life-threatening treatments for infants will be prevented."

 The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made it readily apparent that infectious diseases are a major
threat to U.S. health. The goal of this predoctoral T32 program is to train the next generation of researchers in
microbiology, and to prepare them with the skills necessary to address the nation’s critical needs in the battle
against infectious disease. To do this, we have developed a training program that takes a student-centric,
autonomy-supportive approach with the goal of training self-motivated, independent research scientists who are
well prepared for diverse research careers. Innovative program features include: an autonomy-supportive
educational approach that encourages self-directed exploration of diverse career options; instruction in the “soft
skills” necessary for research career success; and the establishment of faculty mentoring practices that support
student autonomy and self-directed learning.
 The program’s renewal expands and enhances our 6 overarching objectives. First, it will provide
outstanding interdisciplinary research training in microbial pathogenesis, in part by leveraging unique
opportunities created by signature institutional NIH-funded centers that include the Center of Excellence for
Influenza Research and Surveillance, Environmental Health Science Center, Vaccine and Treatments
Evaluation Unit, and the University of Rochester’s Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. Second, it will
provide outstanding education in microbiology and pathogenesis, which incorporates four major components: 1.
a streamlined required core didactic curriculum; 2. required program-specific experiences (including courses,
workshops and career/professional development activities); 3. optional elective courses and experiences
designed to encourage student exploration, and 4. hands-on thesis research. Third, it will train self-directed,
autonomous scientists who are prepared for diverse research career options. To facilitate this, all trainees will
complete a personality inventory and an annual Individualized Development Plan (IDP), participate in
“Microbiology Career Stories” and other activities offered by the UR’s Broadening Experiences in Scientific
Training program which provides avenues for diverse career exploration, and offered the opportunity to
participate in extramural internships. Fourth, we provide training in the “soft-skills” necessary for success through
participation in a “Leadership Academy” program and supervised training in mentoring. Fifth, we will continue to
improve faculty mentoring practices through required instruction in autonomy supportive mentoring practices
involving IDPs and “Mentor our Mentors” workshops. Sixth, we will develop a new UR Student Lifecycle program
to longitudinally track program alumni, obtain experiential feedback to further optimize the program, assess
career outcomes, and establish a formal portal to facilitate trainee networking and career advancement."
10831497,"Studies proposed in this application encompass and extend long-standing interests of the Principal
Investigator in the cell and molecular biology of blood and vascular cells. The proposed Program is comprised
of two ambitious, impactful projects designed to fill important conceptual gaps in their respective fields, and that
have long been judged to be of interest and relevance to the overall mission of the NHLBI; namely (1) The role
of PECAM-1 in vascular cell function, and (2) The pathophysiology of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
(NAIT). PECAM-1 (also known as CD31) is a cellular adhesion and signaling receptor that functions in circulating
blood cells to limit the rate and extent of cellular activation. PECAM-1 is also the most highly-expressed
component of the endothelial cell-cell junction, where it functions as a homophilic adhesive stress-response
protein to maintain endothelial cell junctional integrity and speed restoration of the vascular permeability barrier
following inflammatory or thrombotic challenge. We will exploit our recent determination of the three-dimensional
structure of the PECAM-1 homophilic binding domain, our development of innovative PECAM-1-targeted tools
and animal models, and our discovery that PECAM-1 is subject to conformational affinity modulation to examine
the potential for PECAM-1 to serve as a novel therapeutic target for a wide range of vascular permeability
disorders, including sepsis-induced vascular leakage and ischemia-reperfusion injury. This Program will also
focus on developing new tools, models and treatments for NAIT – a rare, but catastrophic, clinically important
bleeding disorder caused by maternal antibodies generated in response to paternally-inherited antigens present
on fetal platelets that re-cross the placenta and bind to fetal and/or neonatal platelets, resulting in
thrombocytopenia often serious enough to require transfusion, and in the most severe cases causing intracranial
hemorrhage and intrauterine death. Despite advances in treatment, NAIT remains the leading cause of
intracranial hemorrhage in full-term infants, often leading to lifelong disability. We propose to combine recent
transformative advances in CRISPR gene editing technology with the ability to generate megakaryocyte
progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets from induced pluripotent stem cells to establish a transformative
diagnostic platform designed to narrow the existing “diagnostic gap” to improve treatment and care of NAIT -
namely the creation of platelet alloantigen-specific cell lines capable of long-term self-renewal, cryopreservation,
and distribution; thereby providing a potentially inexhaustible source of iPS-derived platelets for diagnostic,
investigative, (and potentially future therapeutic) use. CRISPR technology has also allowed us to develop a novel
humanized mouse model of NAIT that will allow us to resolve a series of outstanding issues in platelet
alloimmunity. Taken together, this research program will apply cutting-edge technology to lay the groundwork
for continuing advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these and related blood and vascular disorders of
relevance to the mission of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute."

Genetic crosses coupled with linkage mapping have provided an outstandingly successful approach for locating
the genetic determinants of biomedically important traits such as drug resistance and host specificity in P.
falciparum malaria. In the initial funding period of this Program Project (P01), we made great strides in
transitioning Plasmodium crosses from the original model using chimpanzees to the human-liver chimeric mouse
infused with human red blood cells (the FRG huHep/huRBC mouse) to generate more than 30 crosses in a span
of 5 years. This included many replicate crosses of 6 different parental combinations that produced nearly a
thousand new cloned progeny. This capacity allowed for optimizations that drove our development of the bulk
segregant analysis (BSA) methodology and put within reach the ability to use experimental crosses of new
clinical isolates to test specific hypotheses about emerging drug resistance. The combination of routine and
replicated experimental crosses with BSA has shifted the challenge from making crosses and identifying genetic
loci to instead prioritizing the rapid identification of genes and mechanisms underling parasite drug resistance
and fitness. Our capstone discovery identified the role of pfaat1 as an epistatic partner with pfcrt in the evolution
of chloroquine resistance that influences the balance between resistance and compensatory fitness, a crucial
determinant of how new drug resistances emerge and spread. The overall goal of this P01 renewal proposal is
to continue to advance this technology to track in real-time the alarming emergence of artemisinin resistance
(ART-R) and its partner drugs used in artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) in East Africa, an imminent
threat to reverse decades of progress against morbidity and mortality due to malaria on the continent where
more than 90% of malaria deaths occur. Coding mutations in the kelch13 gene that are strongly associated with
ART-R and serve as the only markers for surveillance. However, mutations in kelch13 generate a wide range of
resistance levels and fitness effects, and how these effects are compensated by other structural or regulatory
changes in the genome remains unknown. Relying on 3 Research Projects, supported by 2 Scientific Cores, we
will use targeted experimental genetic crosses to (i) dissect the genetic complexity of ART-R, (ii) clarify the role
of kelch13, (iii) define the regulators and partner genes that control ART-R and emerging resistance to
lumefantrine, the predominant ACT partner drug in Africa and (iv) establish a sustainable and user-centric
valuable community resource including our methodological pipeline, data and biological materials. In the
process, we will expand our BSA drug selection protocols to include cutting edge single cell RNAseq as the next
step in building this powerful community resource for real-time solutions to clinically urgent questions."

The Administrative & Resource Sharing Core (Admin Core) based at the University of Notre Dame (UND) will
ensure that the Program Project grant (P01) MPI and Admin Core Director (AD) (Ferdig) and MPI (Vaughan)
are positioned to supervise and administer the P01. The Admin Core Directors (Ferdig and Button-Simons) will
oversee all project communications and sharing of all data and materials with the malaria research community
to maximize accessibility and reusability.
The Admin Core will facilitate communication and interaction between all groups and will thus ensure that the
three physically separate sites will function as a virtual single site. The ADs, MPIs and the Science Management
Team (consisting of one key post-doc from each site), with assistance from the Admin Core Program Manager
(PM), will function to coordinate the overall scientific direction and will monitor ongoing productivity of the P01
and communicate the activities to the Advisory Boards. In its administrative capacity, the Admin Core will
centralize program-wide information, provide administrative support to program investigators, and maintain
records relating to P01 progress. The MPIs will participate and manage at all levels of communication and are
responsible for all aspects of effective operations and collaborative decision-making with the Leadership Team
(LT). The MPIs and LT will coordinate the overall direction of the P01 with feedback from an Internal Advisory
Board (IAB), an External Advisory Board (EAB) and Panel of African Advisors (PAA). The IAB will consist of
distinguished expert faculty at the three performance sites (ND, TBRI and SCRI) and will evaluate ongoing
progress towards P01 goals and provide recommendations for alternative strategies to P01 activities if
modifications are indicated. The EAB will guide and evaluate the overall impact and productivity of the program
in alignment with the broader scientific community in the areas of the P01. The PAA will provide input on
questions of clinical importance in Africa and prioritization of crosses. The EAB will be formed in communication
with NIH Program advisors: the EAB and will consist of worldwide experts on classical genetics, linkage mapping,
systems biology, malaria and drug resistance. The PAA will consist of clinical and research scientists working in
Africa and will include representation from each country with emerging ART-R.
The Admin Core will centralize records for all data and materials created by the P01. The ADs and data sharing
team (Button-Simons, Li and Cheeseman) will ensure raw data are deposited to NCBI and processed data are
shared to VEuPathDB. Working with the ND Center for Research Computing and VEuPathDB we will ensure
tools are created specifically to make P01 data broadly accessible to the malaria research community building
on successful collaborations initiated as part of the original P01. The Admin Core will oversee the expansion
and authentication of key resources (including parents, bulk progeny and cloned progeny) for sharing with the
malaria research community. Resources will be available to the malaria research community upon request and
researchers will be encouraged to feed data and results into a shared data resource housed at VEuPathDB."

 My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these
methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open
source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in
user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of
small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep
learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability
limitations inherent in current approaches.
 We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra-
ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod-
eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties
represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have
desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures
almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and
ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc-
turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further
develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative
process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.
 We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac-
tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the
ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and
diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi-
dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets,
such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications
of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.
 Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools
for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug
discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA,
a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a
Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits.
These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient."

This longstanding NIH grant over its lifetime has made seminal discoveries on the mechanisms of intranuclear
HIV-1 trafficking and nuclear localization. In prior funding cycles, we determined that the nuclear pore complex
protein nucleoporin 153 interacted with the viral protein capsid to affect the translocation of incoming viral
replication complexes into the cell nucleus and sites of viral DNA integration in the human genome. We also
first identified the cellular alternate polyadenylation protein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6
(CPSF6) as a direct binding partner of the viral capsid and revealed an important role for this interaction in
integration of the viral reverse transcript into active chromatin. Over the most recent funding cycle, our work
has clarified that the capsid-CPSF6 interaction is critical for viral replication complexes to travel into the nuclear
structure, where they colocalize with nuclear organelle structures that are known as nuclear speckles. Using
novel bioinformatic tools, our work moreover revealed the significant preference for HIV-1 to integrate into
regions of our genome that physically associate with nuclear speckles. In this way, our most recent research
has clarified the granularity of nuclear architectural structure that most favors and most attracts HIV-1 to its
chromosomal sites of integration. Moving forward, we will determine several unknown aspects of this
fundamental virus-host interaction, including the mechanistic basis of CPSF6 action in HIV-1 intranuclear
targeting as well as the functional consequences of mistargeting, wherein HIV-1 is known to
uncharacteristically integrate into heterochromatic lamina-proximal sequences out towards the periphery of the
nuclear structure. We furthermore will investigate the participations of other host factors that we have
earmarked as behaving biochemically similar to CPSF6 for their roles in HIV-1 trafficking in the nucleus to
preferred sites of integration. We will also investigate the functional consequences of these virus-host
interactions in monocytic cell types, wherein HIV-1 replication complexes can be sensed by cellular innate
machinery to counteract the infection process. The translational relevance of this basic scientific research is
highlighted through the mechanism of action of capsid protein inhibitors such as lenacapavir, which are in late
stage clinical trials and are known to inhibit the interaction of the HIV-1 capsid with Nup153 and CPSF6
proteins in vitro, and to induce HIV-1 integration retargeting in cells. Our proposed work in total will address
fundamental aspects of virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 infection to shield the virus from sensing
in innate immune cells, navigate integration to preferred genomic DNA sites, as well as the consequences of
misguided integration on virus function and reactivation from latency."

Altered glycosylation is concomitant with malignant transformation, but the functional significance with regard to
cancer progression is not well understood. This gap in knowledge is largely attributable to the difficulties
associated with studying cell-surface glycoproteins. Thus, it is imperative to understand how dysregulated
glycosylation contributes to immune evasion, and to develop methods that allow for facile probing of glycan
changes in cancer. We seek to attain these goals with an interdisciplinary approach combining glycoproteomics,
biochemistry, bioinformatics, and spatial visualization of glycans.
First, glycosylation contributes to important immune signaling events within the tumor microenvironment. For
instance, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing 3 (TIM3) is an emerging checkpoint inhibitor
currently under investigation for cancer immunotherapy. TIM3 is a glycosylated mucin glycoprotein, with at least
10 predicted glycosites. However, very little is known regarding TIM3 glycosylation or its effects on protein
function, ligand binding, and immune signaling. One ligand of TIM3, galectin-9 (Gal-9), is known to bind glycans
on TIM3 resulting in downregulation of T cell activation. The particular glycan structure and/or glycosite targeted
by Gal-9 is currently unknown. Thus, in Project 1, we will probe the glycoepitope key to the Gal-9/TIM3 axis by
combining intact glycoproteomics and glycome engineering with biochemical and immunological assays.
In Project 2, our goal is to develop methods for visualization of O-glycan spatial distribution. Currently, the
premier method to spatially examine N-glycans is MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), wherein N-glycans
are removed enzymatically and imaged; however, no homologous enzyme is known for O-glycans. We will
overcome this issue by using a combination of proteases selective for O-glycosylation, referred to as O-
glycoproteases or mucinases. Additionally, we will perform on-tissue microscale glycoproteomics, which will
allow us to couple the O-glycan MSI information with the associated glycoproteins. Together, these experiments
will provide spatial resolution of dysregulated O-glycans and their underlying proteins.
Finally, one of the most significant challenges currently facing the glycoproteomic field is the dearth of accurate
and reliable methods for data processing. In Project 3 we seek to address this disparity by first comparing
currently existing software algorithms with regard to speed, accuracy, user interface, and scoring. Our long-term
goal, though, is to create a novel interface that takes advantage of my laboratory’s extensive experience with
manual validation, de novo sequencing, and C# programming. Our program will include methods used inr de
novo sequencing while accommodating multiple types of glycans, chemical modifications, and MALDI MSI data.
Ultimately, upon attaining the goals of this proposal, the methods and insights we develop will prove invaluable
to the fields of mass spectrometry, glycoproteomics, and MALDI MSI. Additionally, the biological information
gathered will shed light on how glycosylation contributes to tumor progression."

Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is critical to maintain neuronal homeostasis and survival.
Autophagy sequesters damaged and aged cellular components from the intracellular environment and targets
them to lysosomes for destruction. Defective autophagy is linked to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and
neurodegeneration in mammals. Further, activating autophagy can rescue models of neurodegeneration and
age-related cognitive decline in mice. Little is known, however, about the regulation and functions of autophagy
that provide neuroprotection. Much of the work to date elucidating the molecular basis of autophagy has been
performed in model systems that lack the morphological complexity of neurons. Further, our research has
revealed that several canonical paradigms, including starvation and mTOR-inhibition, that trigger autophagy in
non-neuronal cells do not robustly induce autophagy in neurons. Thus, it is critical to study autophagy directly
in neurons to provide insight that may improve therapies to mitigate diseases of neuronal dysfunction. Thus,
the objective for this proposal is to define the roles and regulation of neuronal autophagy that facilitate
neuronal function and survival. We established that autophagy in neurons is a highly compartmentalized
process. Axonal autophagy is a unidirectional pathway that allows cargo delivery from distant regions of the
axon to the soma for degradation. In contrast to the long-range pathway for autophagy in axons, dendritic
autophagy is defined by bidirectional movement of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) that may execute more localized
functions. Our preliminary data have identified three aspects of neuronal biology (synaptic connectivity,
neurotrophic support, and interactions with astrocytes) that regulate autophagy in specific neuronal
compartments. We find that synaptic activity controls AV dynamics selectively in dendrites and not in the axon.
We find that the neurotrophin BDNF induces retrograde autophagic flux along axons. Lastly, we find that co-
culturing neurons with astrocytes decreases autophagosome density in axons. The mechanistic basis for these
pathways and their functions, however, are unknown. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
synaptic activity, neurotrophins, and astrocytes differentially regulate autophagy in neurons, and, that
autophagy plays compartment-specific roles in neuronal function and survival. To test this hypothesis,
we will pursue three aims: (1) Define how synaptic activity regulates neuronal autophagy and how autophagy
affects synapse function; (2) Determine how neurotrophins regulate neuronal autophagy and how autophagy
impacts neurotrophin signaling; and (3) Elucidate how neuronal autophagy is regulated by astrocytes. We will
use quantitative approaches in cell biology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology to gain a mechanistic
understanding for each pathway. These studies will comprehensively map the pathways and functions for
autophagy in neurons in response to diverse interactions from their complex environment. New insights gained
from this study will better inform strategies for therapeutic intervention to treat disorders of the nervous system."

 Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United
States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer
treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal
mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric
density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging
Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy
decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer
variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a
considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to
be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a
more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk
assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with
deep learning and data mining techniques.
 This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality
datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically
relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI-
RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically
relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather
than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural
Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of
patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist-
generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography
and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile
and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in
breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast
cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK
tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or
not to biopsy.
 Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast
cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we
will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer
risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI
technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment
and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety."

East Africa faces unprecedented growth in cancer burden and is inadequately prepared to meet this population
health crisis. In the context of limited resources, it is imperative that policies are evidence-based and target
cancers with highest incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates in the local region. Confronting the growing
burden of cancer in the region requires competent, well-trained African scientists with supportive infrastructure
to generate context-specific evidence to inform cancer control planning. While substantial research
infrastructure already exists in Tanzania, it is predominantly focused on communicable diseases, while cancer
research is nascent. As a regional training hub, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) is
uniquely positioned to play a major role in building capacity for cancer research in Tanzania and the East
Africa region at large. Building upon a shared commitment to improving health outcomes through education
and mentoring, MUHAS and UCSF are poised to expand our ongoing cancer research and training
collaborations to formally establish a Cancer Research Training Program in Tanzania (CRTP-TZ). Our
overarching goal is to train and mentor a cadre of investigators in Tanzania who are capable of
conceptualizing, achieving funding for, implementing, analyzing and publishing original research focused on
cancer. Our hypothesis is that Tanzanian principal investigators can operate effectively and productively if
proper attention is given to selection, provision of high-quality foundational didactic training to learn the theory
and implementation of research, and to the development of a conducive, mentoring environment. The
objectives of the CRTP-TZ will be: (1) to recruit a group of research scholars originating from Tanzania and
other countries in East Africa who are diverse in discipline and who are likely to build successful academic
research careers related to the cancer control science; (2) to provide outstanding, interdisciplinary training in
research methodology in collaboration with faculty from MUHAS, Ocean Road Cancer Institute, and UCSF;
and (3) to provide each scholar with sustained mentorship that fosters scientific advances and career
development. We propose a training model which leverages existing resources in Tanzania and supplements
with rigorous, high-quality coursework and sustained mentorship from UCSF. Specifically, we propose a
training program with three unique pathways, which avail flexibility to build upon pre-existing competencies and
the need to align training opportunities with individual career goals. We will provide sustained mentorship for
scholars in each of the three training pathways as well as training in the principles and practice of good
mentorship for both mentors and mentees. We intend to train a cadre of cancer researchers who are also
future mentors capable of supporting broader initiatives to foster the upward mobility of scholars in Tanzania,
to promote scientific advancement, and to inform cancer control planning in East Africa."

Cardiac fibrosis and inflammation are hallmarks of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. A mediator of cardiac fibrosis,
Larp6 interacts with the 5’ side loop (5’SL) of collagen I mRNA as an adapter protein which functions to
upregulate collagen expression. In our studies, we target the interaction of Larp6 and collagen I mRNA using 1)
genetic manipulation of Larp6 expression in cardiac fibroblasts, 2) a genetically modified mouse model, and 3)
a novel small molecular inhibitor. End points include cardiac functional measures and inflammatory and fibrotic
biomarkers in the heart and in isolated cardiac cells.
First, we reduce Larp6 in cardiac fibroblasts (using shRNA delivered by a lentiviral vector) and use mutated cells
and novel mice lacking functional 5’SL collagen I mRNA (5’SL mice). These interventions prevent Larp6 binding
to collagen mRNA. In vivo exposure to alcohol follows the NIAAA chronic+binge model, and we compare the
5’SL mice to wildtype controls via serial echocardiography every two weeks until terminal, invasive left heart
catheterization. Following extraction of the heart, we stain for collagen, marking fibrotic changes, while
comparing left ventricular size to tibial length, as an index of cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro exposure to alcohol is
up to 48 hours at various doses corresponding to blood alcohol concentration typical of clinical alcohol abuse.
Using qPCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, we assess the following series of biomarkers in
cardiac fibroblasts isolated from our mice: TRAF3IP2, IL1b, IL6, NFkB, and TNFa (to mark inflammation) and
collagens I and III protein and mRNA, a-SMA, TGFβ, LOX and its activity, and hydroxyproline (to mark fibrosis).
In addition to the genetic manipulation, we administer the novel small molecular inhibitor C9 - C9 inhibits the
interaction of Larp6 and the 5’SL units of collagen I mRNA. The same cardiac functional measures
(echocardiography and invasive catherization generating PV curves) are used for wildtype mice and endpoint
assays of inflammatory and fibrotic markers are performed on cardiac fibroblasts.
These data will establish the role of Larp6 in alcoholic cardiomyopathy, characterizing the cardiac fibroblast
response to ethanol, and illustrating how Larp6 affects inflammatory, fibrotic, functional, and structural cardiac
developments in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Ultimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for
the treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy."

 Globally, mental health disorders account for nearly a third of years lived with disability and are the fifth-
leading cause of disability-adjusted life years. Approximately three-quarters of this burden resides in low and
middle-income countries, where a particularly large “mental health treatment gap” exists. This gap is
particularly striking in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), where extremely limited mental health treatment capacity
exists; less than 1 in 27 of those with a mental disorder get minimally adequate treatment.
 The development of in-country leaders in mental health research and policy translation is critical to
address this mental health treatment gap in sSA. Experience in other health areas provides a successful and
sustainable model for change. In Malawi, a series of HIV-focused Fogarty D43s has trained infectious diseases
researchers for over a decade; these trainees now hold key research and policy posts, leading HIV research
and effecting policy change. We aim to expand this successful training model to mental health research.
 Mental health research and policy development is poised for significant growth. In Malawi, known as “the
warm heart of Africa,” the country's first psychiatrist in a generation completed medical training two years
ago. The Malawi College of Medicine enthusiastically supports expansion of its mental health faculty and
research. Multiple funded mental health research grants provide a rich opportunity for mentored research
experiences, and the Ministry of Health mental health unit is committed to translating research to practice.
 We will employ a model to accelerate mental health research capacity across the lifespan in Malawi that
emphasizes three complementary dimensions: depth, breadth, and reach. This initiative builds on the strong
training track records of and successful collaborations between UNC-Chapel Hill, the Malawi College of
Medicine, the Malawi Ministry of Health, and many other partners.
 Specifically, we will 1) train 4 clinical psychiatry researchers and 5 postdoctoral mental health research
fellows who will participate in leadership training, short courses, mentored research projects, writing
workshops, and conference attendance, (depth); 2) hold broad initial stakeholder meetings to prioritize
research and policy questions, require cross-specialty collaboration in mentored research projects, co-sponsor
an Annual Mental Health conference, enhance mentorship skills among in-country faculty, and sponsor regular
mental health journal clubs for a broad audience (breadth); and 3) extend the impact of these researchers
through leadership and policy translation training, require collaboration with a policymaker in mentored
research projects, and hold a policy translation meeting at the end of the project period (reach).
 The Malawian Program for Mental Health Research Training (WARMHEART) will create an expert pool
of mental health researchers trained as leaders and able to collaborate with other disciplines and policymakers
to address the role of psychiatric illness across the lifespan."

Integrator is a multi-protein complex stably associated with the C-terminal domain (CTD)
of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Integrator contains a catalytic RNA endonuclease
subunit (INTS11) with high degree of homology to cleavage and polyadenylation

Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an annual incidence of 3
per million in North America (>300 cases < age 25 in the US yearly). The disease can be treated and often
cured by either immune suppression therapy (IST) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with the
recommended approach in SAA being early matched sibling donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
However, only 20% of patients have sibling donors, consequently, the large majority of patients receive IST for
initial therapy. From initiation of IST it takes 2-6 months to see hematologic improvement, with responses
occurring 70-80% of the time in children. Unfortunately, 20-30% of patients eventually relapse, requiring
additional immune suppression, and some become cyclosporin-dependent. The results of matched unrelated
donor (URD) BMT for SAA has improved significantly over the past decade, with studies reporting similar
outcomes for BMT using URD compared to MSD. Although these data are provocative, URD BMT carries
significant risks, and most consensus opinions still conclude that IST should be considered standard of care
when a matched sibling donor is not available, until a definitive study shows otherwise. To address this
challenge, the North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium (NAPAAC), in collaboration with the
Pediatric Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Consortium (PTCTC), conducted an NHLBI R34-funded pilot
trial to determine feasibility and safety of randomizing between IST and URD BMT. Our recently published
results of the first 23 patients showed high rates of acceptance of randomization, receipt of randomized
therapy without significant adverse events, and rapid institution of definitive therapy (IST or BMT) (Pulsipher
et al., Pediatric Blood and Cancer, 2020). Having demonstrated feasibility, we submit this application to
support a paradigm-changing randomized trial in partnership with the Center for International Blood and
Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). The study proposes a multi-center phase III trial to compare the
percentage of newly diagnosed SAA patients with immune suppression-free survival with adequate counts
(ISFS-AC) at 2-years between those randomized to IST vs 9-10/10 HLA matched URD BMT. The study will
also address patient-reported outcomes and fertility preservation in each arm and explore critical biological
correlates including assessing germline genetic mutations associated with pediatric SAA that may affect
response to BMT or IST and the development of clonal hematopoiesis following IST vs BMT in pediatric SAA.
The study proposed would represent the largest randomized study in pediatric SAA ever attempted with the
goal of providing practice-altering conclusions to the field."
10842385,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Complex behaviors rely on the combination of sensory clues and internal factors like goals, expectations,
memories, and attention. A breakdown of these interactions is thought to be at the core of many
neuropsychiatric disorders. Sensory information is carried by feedforward inputs while internal factors are
conveyed via feedback afferents. Robust evidence from humans, primates, and rodents indicates that sensory
and feedback neuronal pathways converge in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Indeed, the PPC is thought
to be fundamental to an array of cognitive processes including working memory and decision-making. These
data suggest that PPC neurons play a key role in integrating sensory and cognitive information streams. Yet,
we have a critical gap in our knowledge regarding the synaptic mechanisms integrating feedforward
inputs with feedback signals in the PPC. This lack of insight limits our ability to understand how neuronal
circuit interactions drive behavior and how impaired integration leads to neuropsychiatric disorders.
In preliminary experiments, we used two-color optogenetics to independently control cortical afferent pathways.
We discovered that PPC neurons receive direct, monosynaptic innervation from both feedforward and
feedback sources. Furthermore, we found marked differences in how functionally distinct subclasses of layer 5
pyramidal neurons integrate inputs from discrete long-range afferents. Specifically, intratelencephalically
projecting (IT) cells exhibited nonlinear response enhancement while subcortically projecting
extratelencephalic (ET) neurons summed inputs linearly. These data motivate our central hypothesis that cell-
type specific integration of feedforward and feedback synapses drives input / output transformations
in the PPC. To test this hypothesis, we propose a complementary use of opto- and chemogenetic circuit
manipulation, brain slice electrophysiology and computational modelling. First, we will determine the temporal
rules governing the interaction of feedback and feedforward afferents in distinct layer 5 projection neurons (Aim
1). Then we will combine two-color optogenetics with circuit specific chemogenetic silencing (DREADDs) to
determine how cell-type specific synaptic integration drives the functional output of the PPC network (Aim 2).
Finally, we will take advantage of computational methods to determine what ionic conductances underlie the
cell-type specificity of feedforward-feedback integration (Aim 3). Completion of this research will provide novel
insights into the cellular mechanisms underpinning the interaction of sensory and feedback information
streams. This knowledge will further our understanding of the principles that guide information processing in
the neocortex and provide the foundation for future basic and translational research."

exist for opioid overdose events, the lack of effective therapeutics for long-term abstinence and
prevention of relapse highlight the pressing need for alternative approaches to study OUD.
 Moving beyond their direct effect on neuronal function, opioids are also known to act directly on
microglia. Microglia are resident immune cells in the brain that serve as key drivers of
neuroinflammation, a physiological process aimed at restoring homeostasis typically in response to a
traumatic, chemical or ischemic insult to the central nervous system. A hallmark of neuroinflammation
is microglial activation, and the transcriptional mechanisms underlying microglial activation operate
under control of epigenetic remodeling of histone proteins. In the context of OUD, it has been previously
shown that opioids can induce activation of microglia and that reduction in neuroinflammation can curb
craving for opioid painkillers.
 Considering the known role of epigenetics in addiction and the emerging role of microglia in this
disease, we propose to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of microglial activation in OUD. More
specifically, we will focus on the changes in histone lysine methylation in microglia of the brain reward
system and how these changes comport with transcriptional programs across various phases of opioid-
taking (maintenance, early withdrawal, and craving) by using a mouse model of intravenous
remifentanil self-administration (IVSA). Furthermore, we will explore the role of this epigenetic
modification in regulating opioid-induced microglial activation, opioid-seeking and relapse by
pharmacological and genetic manipulation of Kdm6b, a histone lysine demethylase enriched in
microglia. In conclusion, results from these experiments have the potential to not just broaden our
understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying OUD, but rather push the field of addiction
epigenetics beyond the neuron and into cell types that could yield exciting new therapeutic avenues for
the treatment this devastating disease."

This competing renewal U01 application proposes an investigation of the impact of rapidly evolving substance
use patterns on HIV prevention and HIV-associated co-morbidities. We propose to undertake this work in
Vancouver, Canada, where, as in many areas in the US, exponential growth in synthetic opioid use has become
a health crisis. Accordingly, we seek to characterize emerging drug use patterns and the associated impacts on
engagement in HIV prevention and medication assisted treatments for opioid use disorder (MAT). We also aim
to assess willingness to use, uptake of, and adherence to new and emerging HIV-focused biomedical
interventions (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], microbicides). In Vancouver, PrEP has recently been made
available at no cost to those at high risk of HIV acquisition, including people who inject drugs (PWID). We further
aim to examine key HIV-associated co-morbidities, in particular pain and neurocognitive impairment, among a
combined sample of HIV-negative and HIV-positive PWID and the related impacts on substance use patterns,
engagement in HIV prevention and MAT. This project involves the continuation of the Vancouver Drug Users
Study (V-DUS; n = 1800), which is one of the longest-running prospective cohort studies of community-recruited
people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) internationally. The V-DUS is comprised of two nested cohorts following
HIV-negative street-involved drug-using youth aged 14-26 years and HIV-negative adult PWID since 1996. Our
study setting is a key innovative feature of the proposed work. Vancouver is a port city that continues to
experience high availability and prevalent use of a wide range of illicit drugs. It is home to one of the most
dramatic outbreaks of HIV among PWID and is now an epicenter of the ongoing synthetic opioid epidemic. In
response, a range of pioneering policies and programs specific to illicit drug use have been introduced, and
several of these are now being scaled up and/or considered in the US. For example, a broad set of MAT are
available for virtually free of charge through the universal healthcare plan and in a low threshold manner, which
allows us to examine MAT-related outcomes without the confounding effects of insurance schemes and
programmatic barriers associated with high-threshold provision of MAT. The V-DUS is also a member of the
C3PNO consortium and thereby ideally positioned to advance team science approaches. V-DUS has been highly
productive and is a globally unique, valuable resource for advancing HIV research and training future HIV
researchers. During the past grant cycle, >130 of >160 peer-reviewed publications have been led by >70 trainees.
The V-DUS is also harmonized with an ongoing NIDA-funded cohort of HIV-positive PWUD and therefore a key
control/comparison in work focused on HIV/AIDS among PWUD is possible. Given our environment and track
record to date, we are well positioned to generate important scientific evidence on HIV prevention and HIV-
associated co-morbidities thereby contributing to high and medium research priorities identified by the NIH Office
of AIDS Research and informing efforts to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic."
10842350,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Complex chronic conditions (CCCs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide and
disproportionately affect disadvantaged and low/middle income regions. Although many CCCs are preventable,
and patients currently benefit from ongoing improvements in disease diagnosis and treatment, CCC-associated
morbidity and mortality remains substantial. Due to the inherent complexity associated with the inter-related
predisposing factors that influence health outcomes, multi-faceted approaches are critical to identifying future
interventions that can prevent and manage CCCs, and minimize/manage the short and long-term sequelae of
treatment and the disease itself. Future discovery of innovative and impactful approaches to minimize CCC
burden depends on the skill and willingness of emerging researchers to engage in team science, which offers
enhanced opportunities for success compared to a single disciplinary approach. This T32 competitive renewal
application will prepare nurse scientists to leverage collaborative science teams and networks when
developing and testing interventions to improve health in the context of high complexity. This application builds
on the important concept of complexity by expanding the training opportunities in the area of team science.
 Thus, the goal of this T32 renewal application, entitled Complexity: Innovations in Promoting Health
through Team Science (CHEeTAh), is to educate 11 pre-doctoral trainees to become innovative scientists who
will leverage team science approaches to promote health for individuals and populations with (or at risk for)
CCCs. The pedagogic program, research training, and mentorship plans outlined in this proposal are
consistent with our current successful T32 training program, but we will expand the previous three-year training
plan to a four-year plan to facilitate more training in team science.
 Specifically, we will train nurse scientists to: 1) Investigate the complex array of personal, social, and
environmental factors that influence the health of individuals and populations at risk for or diagnosed with
chronic illness to inform the design and testing of interventions; 2) Integrate team science approaches when
developing and testing innovative interventions to address highly complex problems; 3) Design and test
innovative approaches to promote health which prevent the development of chronic conditions at the individual
and population levels in those at higher risk; and 4) Design and test innovative approaches to promote health
among those with chronic conditions to enable them to live well with chronic illness.
 The training program is organized in four pillars: course work, research experience, mentoring, and
professional socialization, all inclusive of leading and participating in teams. Trainees will benefit from an
individualized development plan and an interdisciplinary mentorship team. Promoting team science is a cross-
cutting theme within the National Institute of Health (NIH) strategic plan and the National Institute of Nursing
Research (NINR) priority to foster cross-disciplinary research to advance symptom science."
10842351,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a 5-year research training program for Jody Lin, MD, MS, a pediatric hospitalist at the
University of Utah. Dr. Lin’s long-term goal is to become an independent physician scientist who develops
scalable decision support tools to improve outcomes for children with medical complexity through shared
decision making (SDM). The award will support Dr. Lin to accomplish the following goals: 1) Gain expertise in
the psychology of decision making, 2) Undergo advanced training in risk communication strategies in settings
of uncertainty, 3) Obtain experience in applying implementation science to the design of decision support tools,
4) Acquire leadership skills in assembling and managing multidisciplinary scientific teams. Dr. Lin will be
supported by an outstanding team of mentors who are dedicated to her success and possess diverse expertise
in decision science (Dr. Fagerlin), health communication (Dr. Kaphingst), implementation science (Dr. Asch),
and pediatric orthopaedics (Dr. Narayanan). Dr. Lin also has three advisors with expertise in children with
medical complexity, career development, and biostatistics.
In spite of broad recognition that SDM is a promising approach to improving outcomes for children with medical
complexity, little is known about how to improve SDM for these children in the clinical setting. This project will
develop and test the feasibility of a novel decision support tool on surgical treatment decision making for
children with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS). The aims of the project are as follows. In aim 1, Dr. Lin will apply
new skills in health communication to identify effective risk communication methods to communicate
uncertainty in decision making for children with NMS. In aim 2, Dr. Lin will design a decision support tool for
use during orthopaedic consultation for children with NMS, including discoveries from aim 1. In aim 3, Dr. Lin
will conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of the decision support tool. This study will inform the
development of a large, multicenter trial of the decision support tool for children with NMS.
Through the training and research activities embedded in this proposal, Dr. Lin will address gaps in our
understanding of how to support treatment decision making for children with NMS. This study will serve as a
critical model for developing decision supports for clinical decisions in the growing population of children with
medical complexity. Completion of the proposed activities will prepare Dr. Lin to independently lead a larger
research program evaluating and developing decision support to improve outcomes for populations of children
and adults with multiple comorbid conditions through better SDM."
10842380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rapid increase in painful intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IDD) makes it an urgent need to develop
solutions for delaying IDD progression. IDD is associated with chronic inflammation, loss of IVD cellularity,
matrix degradation and apoptosis, which are accelerated by dephosphorylation of AKT, PKC, and MAPK
signaling pathways. We present preliminary evidence that the phosphatase Pleckstrin homology domain
leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) promotes IDD. Thus global deletion of PHLPP1
repressed IDD progression in old mice by preventing matrix degradation and reducing pro-inflammatory
cytokine expression. Our preliminary data on degenerated human NP cells suggested that pro-inflammatory
responses were decreased after treatment with a small molecule PHLPP inhibitor. We previously developed
injectable, nanoformulations that are capable of delivering small molecules at constant rates over an extended
period of time. Based on these findings, our preliminary proof of concept and feasibility as well as our recent
publication, we propose to test the novel hypothesis that NP compartment specific inhibition of PHLPP1 will
delay disease progression via suppressing inflammation and matrix degradation in age-induced spontaneous
IDD.
Aim 1 will identify the role of PHLPP1 on IDD in the NP compartment in vivo using a model of age-induced
spontaneous IDD in conditional Phlpp1 knockout mice. Phlpp1 will be depleted in NP (NPcKO) and the role
of Phlpp1 will be assessed with immunohistochemical, molecular, and biomechanical methods. In vitro studies
will evaluate the differentially regulated pathways by single cell RNA-sequencing and molecular-biological
analysis of mouse NPcKO as well as PHLPP1 knockdown in human NP cells. Aim 2 will test the efficacy of a
small molecule PHLPP inhibitor to decelerate IDD by developing an injectable nanoformulation for long-term
PHLPP inhibitor release and evaluate its efficacy in a mouse model of spontaneous IDD.
This project is highly significant because discogenic backpain is a major burden in the United States. New
insights in mechanisms and minimal invasive treatments of IDD will combine mechanistic and translational
studies. This study is innovative because the development of a small molecule PHLPP inhibitor has not been
previously described and the use of NIR labeled nanoformulations for controlled PHLPP inhibitor delivery to
treat IDD is a technical innovation. Successful completion of this study will provide new insights into NP
compartment specific progression of IDD and advance small molecule PHLPP inhibitor laden nanoformulation
injection as a potential disease-modifying treatment for IDD in humans."

The Wake Forest (WF) Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) joined the CTSA consortium in 2015
with the goal of catalyzing our health system’s transformation into an exemplary Learning Health System (LHS).
Since then, we have extended this LHS framework by integrating traditional academic goals of T0-T4 translation,
scholarship, and education while also promoting health equity and the vitality of the communities we serve. We
call this evolved vision the Academic Learning Health System (aLHS). Achieving this vision requires scientists
with a deep understanding of the translational science process that moves from data to evidence to practice and
policy in a continuous cycle. To develop this critical workforce, the CTSI K12 Program will provide a rigorous
training program for an outstanding, diverse, carefully selected early-career faculty that develops expertise in
eight LHS science competency domains identified by the AHRQ/PCORI LHS Learning Collaborative. These
competencies support the traits of translational scientists as outlined by the international Translation Together
collaborative. The K12 Program builds on our highly successful KL2 Program, which to date has trained 28
translational scientists who received 55 subsequently funded awards and published 539 manuscripts; many of
them have advanced to become leaders in our CTSI. We will retain those training elements proven to be highly
effective and add new initiatives in response to rigorous programmatic evaluations. Our growing healthcare
system serves nearly 6 million patients in 1,167 sites of care, offering an ideal laboratory for K12 Scholars to
work across the full translational spectrum, from pre-clinical discoveries to testing clinical interventions to
implementation. Notably, WF serves as the academic core of this new health system, and our aLHS serves as
a guiding framework for advancing care delivery throughout the system. To develop the critical workforce and
create a pipeline of highly trained translational scientists needed for the aLHS, the CTSI K12 Program has four
objectives: 1) Support a highly effective faculty development core that integrates CTSA network initiatives; 2)
Identify and recruit promising K12 Scholars using a rigorous process that recognizes diversity in all of its
dimensions; 3) Nurture the development of translational scientists through a curriculum that includes individual
development plans and recognizes the importance of team science and evidence-based mentorship; 4) Expand
our novel online learning management system, the Learning Translational Research Education Enhancement
(Learning TREE) tool, to connect individuals at all levels of training with outstanding educational resources. This
Program will build cohorts of six Scholars (four NCATS-supported and two supported by institutional funds), at
the early career faculty level. Scholars will be appointed for two years and eligible to receive an additional two
years of salary support through our WF early career K awardee salary support program."
10841189,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Training the next generation of translational scholars who can innovate, think creatively, and apply
rigorous and responsible research principles to major problems is society's best chance to recoup its
enormous investment in biomedical research. The Stanford CTSA's proposed Mentored Research Career
Development Program (K12) sits at the center of a dynamic Stanford and Silicon Valley ecosystem of
biomedical research at all stages, from basic discovery to practical implementation. Our KL2 program has a
15-year history of successfully training Scholars to become exceptional scientists, leaders and mentors. Our
Scholars have over 2,749 publications (average 58 each) cited over 45,000 times since graduation, and all
who have graduated since 2021 in the last two cycles have received subsequent independent research
funding. That success has rested on a philosophy of practical, individualized training tailored to the Scholars
and focused on the established characteristics of successful translational scientists. We will provide tailored
mentoring and career development for four to five instructors and junior faculty from diverse backgrounds each
year. Our alliance with the VA early career and Center for Digital Health training programs brings new
colleagues into our scholarly community.
 Thematic emphases include community engagement, interdisciplinary teams and leveraging
developments in informatics to accelerate translational research and rigor and reproducibility of clinical
research to ensure that translated products will truly benefit patients. The science of translation brings that
rigor to the study of moving research across the translational spectrum and is embedded throughout our
program. We have strong recruitment plan to enhance diversity, and have substantially expanded Scholar
training in that area with an innovative advanced program.
 We structure our program around four specific aims: mentorship, education and professional
development, evaluation, and impact. We have assembled a world-class faculty who are committed to training
and mentoring our Scholars who together have a research program funded in excess of $350 million. The
MPIs are both award-winning mentors with strong experience in leading large research projects and synergistic
strengths. We have also assembled an outstanding teams of mentors specific to community engagement and
analytic methods, as well as a strong emphasis on peer mentoring. The education and professional
development aim covers not just the domains of translational research and the science of translation but
lectures and experiences designed to imbue Scholars with the practical and leadership skills they will need to
succeed. Our diverse External Advisory Board of nationally renowned educators and scientists will, together
with the Community Advisory Board, give the program strategic guidance. A robust evaluation and a long-term
outcomes tracking plan ensures that we will continuously improve this program and maximize impact."

The emergence of large integrated health systems linked by common informatics platforms offers an
unprecedented opportunity to study the impact of new therapies, healthcare delivery models, and strategies to
mitigate health disparities in real world settings. Such integrated systems also offer opportunities to test
approaches to implement and scale evidence-based practices, to address gaps in translational science, and to
become Learning Health Systems (LHS). The Wake Forest (WF) Clinical and Translational Science Institute
(CTSI) has pioneered the integration of the academic mission into the LHS framework including T0-T4
translation, scholarship, and education while also addressing the social determinants of health and promoting
the vitality of the communities served. WF leads as the academic core of Advocate Health – the nation’s fifth
largest not-for-profit health system serving nearly 6 million patients across the Southeast and Midwest United
Sates. The aLHS is Advocate Health’s guiding vision, and the WF CTSI is its central resource for supporting
translational science across the entire system. The size of the health system offers a unique opportunity to
develop, demonstrate, and disseminate novel care models in a wide range of settings. With this funding, the
WF CTSI will drive the realization of the full potential of an aLHS and create a model for advancing translational
science in a large academic health system. The need for such a model is urgent, given the ongoing consolidation
of academic and non-academic health systems in the United States and the challenges in conducting research
in busy practice settings. All activities and initiatives to advance translational science will be grounded in a culture
of accountability for enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. WF CTSI’s vision will be achieved through the
four specific aims: 1) Support an inclusive and highly effective governance structure that promotes a culture of
continuous quality improvement, enables timely response to regional and national health emergencies, supports
proactive dissemination and implementation, and enables active participation in CTSA-sponsored trials; 2)
Recruit and train a highly competent and diverse aLHS workforce and engage the full range of patient and
community stakeholders who are essential to improving health and mitigating health disparities; 3) Provide
resources to promote innovative pragmatic study designs, support pilot studies that address key translational
roadblocks, and satisfy the needs of the aLHS research community for timely access to data from electronic
health records, population surveys, omics analyses, and other sources; and 4) Enhance translational efficiency
through projects testing novel methods (e.g., respondent driven sampling to improve patient recruitment,
integrating patient generated data into the EHR). Innovations made in achieving these aims will be shared
through and beyond the CTSA national network."

This renewal application focuses on studying the roles of messenger RNA binding proteins
(mRBPs) in the regulation of alternative splicing and mRNA translation. Our approach uses a
combination of genomics, molecular biology and biochemistry to gain fundamental insights to
mRBP function and targets in human cells. During the previous funding period we discovered
functional RNA elements that control pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA translation. The goal of the
next funding period is to determine how these sequences regulate gene expression. Another
goal of this project is to determine how the process of alternative splicing impacts protein
synthesis. It is well established that alternative splicing expands the coding potential of protein
coding genes, but we and others have also discovered that mRNA isoforms can exhibit different
patterns of translational control and mRNA stability. We will elucidate the mechanisms through
which alternative splicing influences translation by discovering isoform-specific cis-acting RNA
elements that influence polyribosome association. To accomplish this goal, we will use
composite cell lines that contain a full complement of human and chimpanzee chromosomes.
These novel models will enable the discovery of single nucleotide changes that cause allele-
specific gene expression within the identical trans-regulatory environment. We can then
determine the mechanisms of action for these regulatory elements using biochemical and
molecular approaches, such as RNA affinity chromatography and mRNA reporter assays.
Together, this project will significantly advance the understanding ofr how mRBPs function in
post-transcriptional control of gene expression in human cells and provide key information for
novel strategies to treat inherited diseases."

Regulation of transcription is essential for cell function. In eukaryotes, diverse mechanisms control transcription
through chromatin structure and organization of DNA within the nucleus. Histone modifications modulate the
activity of gene regulatory elements and regulate binding of proteins that form transcriptionally active and
inactive compartments. Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes bind and translocate on
DNA, forming loops that bring distant sites into contact. As the molecular activities of individual chromatin
modifiers and SMC complexes are being studied, it is important to determine how they integrate with each
other to control transcription during development and differentiation.
Our research program addresses the functional interactions between SMC complexes, chromatin, and
transcription around three topics. The first focuses on condensin, a eukaryotic SMC complex that has been
challenging to study in vivo because it is essential for cell division and binds chromosomes transiently during
mitosis. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a hermaphrodite-specific condensin functions throughout the
cell cycle to repress X chromosome transcription for dosage compensation. Condensin DC also controls
histone modifications, providing an excellent system to study integration of SMC activity and chromatin
modifiers for transcription regulation. The second topic focuses on the interaction between condensin and
cohesin, another SMC that regulates the organization of eukaryotic genomes during interphase. As cells
progress from interphase to mitosis, cohesin binding and activity decreases while condensin’s increase and
transcription is silenced. This transition is key to regulation of cell-type specific transcriptional programs during
differentiation. By addressing how condensin DC interacts with cohesin on the X chromosomes, we believe our
work can provide insights into the interphase to mitotic transition of the eukaryotic genomes. The third topic is
regulation of RNA Polymerase III, which transcribes a diverse array of small functional RNAs, including tRNAs.
RNA Pol III regulation is relatively understudied and is important for protein translation in health and disease.
Due to unique chromosomal distribution of tRNA genes, our work in C. elegans dosage compensation puts us
in an ideal place to study the mechanisms that regulate RNA Pol III transcription.
In the next five years our research will provide significant insights into how cohesin, condensin and chromatin
work together to regulate transcription during development and differentiation. Our program is also evolving to
address environmental gene regulation and RNA Pol III transcription – new and important areas of study to
understand basic mechanisms of genome organization and function throughout the life of an organism."
10842825,"Project Summary
Quickly growing genomic and phenotypic data in large-scale biobank efforts are increasingly associating
genetic variants to the predisposition, onset, and progression of human diseases. However, knowledge
remains limited about the mechanisms underlying those associations, not to mention that many more
variants are with uncertain clinical significance. The widening gap between variant data and mechanistic
knowledge further hinders the delivery of prognostics, diagnostics, and therapeutics for growing
healthcare demands.
 In response to the knowledge gap, the PI’s long-term research goal is twofold: (1) to unravel how a
genetic change ripples through various aspects across atomic, molecular, and cellular levels to cause
human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective
therapeutic strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward the long-term research goal, this
project focuses on coding variants leading to protein mutations, builds upon our recent progress in
physics-driven protein design and data-driven machine learning for mutational effects, and proposes to
widen and deepen the unraveling of disease-associated protein mutations along three directions. The first
two directions involve forward prediction and causal inference of hierarchical mutational phenotypes
across molecular and cellular levels, which will generate mechanistic hypotheses while predicting disease
phenotypes. The third direction involves inverse design of perturbation experiments, including protein
mutagenesis and ligand perturbation, to test the generated mechanistic hypotheses directly and rationally.
To advance along the three directions in the next five years, we will integrate molecular physics, systems
knowledge, and emerging large-scale functional data in a systematic and rigorous framework to
probabilistically predict, explain, and design phenotypes of protein mutations across biological scales.
And we will fuse molecular modeling, network analysis, multimodal machine learning, graph learning, and
conditional generative models in this regard, while continuing experimental and clinical collaborations in
teams and communities. The expected contributions of the project, besides the computational methods,
predicted phenotypes, hypothesized mechanisms, and designed experiments, also include an integrated
data platform friendly for cross-disciplinary machine learning and a resource and discovery platform
promoting clinical feedback loops."
10849606,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts approximately 1.5% of children
in the United States. Individuals with ASD experience deficits in social communication or restricted interests and
repetitive behavior; but the severity and patterns vary greatly and convey lifelong impairment for some. It is
unclear how the presentation of ASD changes from early childhood into adolescence or adulthood. The causes
of ASD are also unknown, though substantial evidence supports the contribution of both genes and
environmental factors. These gaps in knowledge exist because US studies to date have lacked the sample size,
depth of data collection, or appropriate life course timing to address these questions. The Study to Explore Early
Development (SEED) is now able to address these prior limitations. SEED is a large case-control study of
children ages 2-5 years and their families, implemented across eight states over three phases. SEED collected
detailed data on children’s core ASD symptoms, cognitive status, and presence of co-occurring conditions in
early childhood, along with extensive risk factors related to maternal health and the perinatal environment as
well as genomics. The SEED sample includes 2044 children with ASD, 1950 children with non-ASD
developmental disabilities (DD), and 2285 population control children (POP), making this the largest etiologic
study of ASD in the US. Recent ancillary studies - the SEED Teen Pilot and SEED COVID studies -- will soon
add data on adolescent health and the consequences of the pandemic, respectively, for some SEED participants.
The work proposed here, SEED Follow-up Studies (SEED FU), will maximize the impact of extant SEED data
through analyses that characterize ASD phenotypes and assess the potential interplay between genetic and
modifiable risk factors. SEED FU will also facilitate new data collection in middle childhood, adolescence and
early adulthood to characterize changes in ASD phenotype across developmental stages, and the associated
health, educational, and service needs across the early life course. These data will further enable prospective
analyses of associations between early life factors and later childhood through early adulthood outcomes.
Studying risk factors in relation to life course phenotypic subgroups may also help elucidate etiologies previously
masked in ASD case-control studies. The Maryland SEED Team in combination with the SEED Network’s
collaborative infrastructure and extensive extant data resources, will ensure the successful implementation of
the SEED FU Study in Maryland and contribute to success across the network. SEED is well-powered for making
significant contributions to our understanding of the complex autism phenotype and identifying factors associated
with ASD risk in the population. The knowledge gained by SEED FU will greatly advance our ability prevent
adverse developmental outcomes and to support individuals with ASD and their families to ensure optimal
wellbeing through early adulthood."

Obesity is a chronic disease that affects more than 650 million adults and more than one in five children
worldwide. Obesity is also a serious risk factor for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia,
hypertension, at least 13 cancers, thus it has a significant impact on public health. Pharmacological and
surgical interventions show promising weight loss and remission of co-morbidities, yet maintaining weight loss
over the long-term remains extremely challenging. Therefore, obesity warrants heightened attention from
enhanced research as does the underlying pathophysiology of body weight regulation, appetite, metabolism,
weight loss, and weight loss maintenance. It is paramount that a highly skilled workforce of curious and team-
oriented scientists of varying disciplines emerge to tackle the complex issues surrounding the biology,
prevention, and treatment of obesity. For the past 20 years, this T32 postdoctoral training program has trained
the highest caliber of postdoctoral fellows to become productive research scientists in obesity with established
successful scientific careers in academia, academic medicine, governmental agencies, and in the private
sector. The five fundamental goals of our program are to: 1) recruit and retain talented postdoctoral scientists
who want to become experts in obesity research; 2) connect talented trainees with an experienced, NIH-
funded faculty member and a multidisciplinary mentoring team of expert research scientists; 3) ensure that
trainees take advantage of all elements of a structured training program that includes a robust research
experience, completion of coursework in obesity science and practice, competing for internal pilot and
feasibility grants, responsible conduct of research, and methods for enhancing reproducibility training; 4)
support trainees to be productive scientists with their own high level of expertise in obesity research and ability
to secure independent grant funding; 5) prepare trainees to find research positions in academics, industry or
equivalent where they will remain productive and gain national support for their own research programs. The
program takes advantage of the rich intellectual environment, cutting-edge technologies, core services, and the
wide range of research endeavors related to obesity at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. During their 2
years of training, postdoctoral trainees engage in didactic training as well as in-depth, hands-on research that
will enable postdoctoral trainees to acquire transdisciplinary research skills, write papers, and write competitive
grant proposals addressing important questions on pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of obesity.
These endeavors will train the next generation of scientists who will move the needle forward on obesity
science answering a need that has both national and international urgency."

Alopecia Areata (AA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the hair follicle that results in hair loss. The exact cause
of AA is unknown, genetic predisposition and environmental triggers might play important roles in the disease.
We previously identified CD8+NKG2D+ T cells as the key pathogenic drivers in AA and our findings led to
targeting pathogenic CD8+ T cells through blocking the gamma chain signaling pathway with JAK inhibitors in
AA treatment. Recently, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) together with single-cell TCR
sequencing (scTCRseq), and found that the most highly clonally expanded CD8+NKG2D+ T cells were also
positive for the inhibitory receptor, NKG2A. NKG2D is a critical activating receptor in both innate and adaptive
immune responses.. In contrast, the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, along with its co-receptor, CD94, engages the
nonclassical MHC class I molecule HLA-E in humans, or the Qa-1 molecule in mice. Engagement of NKG2A
results in the attenuation of the effector activity of CD8+ T cells. Our discovery of clonally expanded
NKG2A+NKG2D+CD8+ T cells is profoundly significant in AA, since it provides a crucial new insight into the nature of
the dysregulated effector responses in AA. We postulate that the inhibitory signal from NKG2A/CD94 is not sufficient
to attenuate the ongoing immune response AA, and/or that the activating signals such as from NKG2D are too potent
to be suppressed by NKG2A signaling. The work outlined in this proposal will interrogate the role of NKG2A in AA
pathogenesis, the regulation of ligand expression in the hair follicle, and targeting NKG2A to enhance inhibitory
signaling and/or dampen the effector activity of NKG2A+NKG2D+CD8+ T cells as a potential therapeutic strategy
for disease. These studies will expand our knowledge of therapeutically enhancing signaling by inhibitory
receptors, such as NKG2A, in the setting of autoimmunity, where there is a clear knowledge gap. Our results
will have broad relevance to autoimmune diseases that share common genetic causes, common therapeutic
targets, and potentially common treatments with AA.

10859349,"Large protein language models have shown their foundational role in biomedical research. However, two
challenges are roadblocking their broad applications: (a) the absence of critical knowledge about protein
structure and functions in the models, and (b) the lack of efficient approaches to adapt a trained protein
language model. To address the two challenges, we propose to develop protein language models with
knowledge of protein structures and functions, and adaptation methods that can provide accurate predictions
for protein properties. The goal is to develop and validate the structure-function-aware large protein
language models (SF-PLM) that could be adapted to operate challenging biomedical research tasks
using few-shot learning. We hypothesize that (a) multi-view contrastive learning can fuse 2D/3D structural
information into 1D representation, (b) well-developed reinforcement learning can align a large protein language
model with the related function annotation, and (c) prompt tuning can realize a few-shot learning process to
adapt the trained models to specific biomedical tasks. Inspired by the hypotheses, we develop three Specific
Aims to help achieve the proposal's goal. Aim 1: Develop large protein language models aware of 2D and 3D
structures using multi-view contrastive learning. We will develop the encoders for the protein 1D, 2D, and 3D
structures; optimize the model training procedure and contrastive loss functions, and validate and select the
developed models using structure-oriented downstream tasks. Aim 2: Develop a reinforcement learning-
based method to align knowledge of protein functions with the structure-aware large protein language models.
We will start by developing an initial policy model, further develop the reward model and proximal policy
optimization to align the trained large protein language models and validate and select the aligned large
protein language models. Aim 3: Develop prompt technologies and tools to adapt structure-function-aware
large protein language models for downstream tasks. We will develop prompt tuning to adapt the trained
protein language models for antimicrobial peptide design and predict the targets and phosphorylation
strengths for polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), an overexpressed kinase in cancer cells. We will build utilities to
enable the community usage of the prompt tuning. The success of the proposed research will lead to (a) the
development of novel large protein language models aware of structures and functions, (b) prompt-based
efficient adaptation of trained large protein language models for downstream tasks, (c) several novel
antimicrobial peptides, (d) a list of predicted substrates and their phosphorylation strengths of PLK1, and (f)
a library of Python code that enables the development of the pre-trained protein language models and
efficient prompt tuning. These outcomes will provide and validate fundamental deep learning tools for
biomedical research. The outcome (c) and (d) will further enhance biomedical research in bacterial
resistance and cancer treatment."
10862633,"Project Summary
A major focus of biomedical research that involves sequencing of the genome and transcriptome is to
understand how genes are regulated and also dysregulated in disease. Integrated analyses of epigenome and
epitranscriptome changes are urgently needed to have a complete molecular profile of cellular changes and to
understand the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation. Yet, standard sequencing methods are unable to
capture the full complexity of the epigenome (DNA modifications and chromatin accessibility) or the
epitranscriptome (RNA modification). Problems inherent to current Illumina-based sequencing include:
introduction of PCR bias, short-length of the reads, and the inability to directly sequence RNA molecules. To
address these needs, we are developing experimental and computational approaches that allow us to (a)
simultaneously detect, in vivo, DNA modifications and DNA accessibility on long stretches of single DNA
molecule sequences and correlate these changes with effects on the epitranscriptome by (b) directly profiling
full-length alternative RNA isoforms, RNA edits, and RNA modifications from single RNA molecule sequences.
Our combined approach will rely on Oxford Nanopore long-read technologies which is capable of distinguishing
modified bases in DNA and RNA, and on in vivo methods of marking accessible regions of chromatin. To
demonstrate the applicability and relevance of our methods, we will perform these experiments under
biological conditions known to impact both chromatin structure and the epitranscriptome. We also plan to (c)
profile epigenomic and epitranscriptomic changes in response to knockdown of key chromatin remodeling
genes and RNA binding proteins to test if, and how broadly, these regulatory factors affect the epigenome and
epitranscriptome. Our combined approach of long-range detection of modified and accessible regions of
DNA with detection of isoform-specific RNA processing events will provide a much-needed broadly
applicable tool to elucidate the mechanisms governing cell signaling responses involving chromatin
and transcriptome alterations."
10862634,"Project Summary:
 Learning and executing motor skills are crucial functions of the brain and involve the coordinated activity of
the motor cortex and basal ganglia. Notably, the connections between the primary motor cortex (M1) and the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a major target of M1 output neurons, are crucially involved in motor learning. Loss-
of-function studies, such as DLS lesions or silencing spiny projection neurons (SPNs) impairs learned motor
behaviors, and blocking SPN plasticity by deleting NMDA receptors on SPNs prevents mice from learning new
motor skills. In addition, in movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia,
disruption of ensemble activity of neurons in the DLS or M1 may mediate behavioral deficits. Yet, direct
evidence of plasticity and dynamics of corticostriatal synapses during motor learning is surprisingly lacking.
One reason for this gap is the widespread and convergent innervation of corticostriatal projections which has
made it challenging to assess the function and plasticity of this circuit over the course of motor learning. How
corticostriatal synaptic plasticity contributes to motor learning and the formation of motor memory in vivo
remains unclear. Motor learning leads to adaptation of neuronal activity patterns in M1 as well as in DLS and
their activity becomes more closely associated with learned movements. An intriguing interpretation of these
adaptations in neuronal activity is that such behavior-related neurons may represent the neural correlate of
motor memory, forming a motor memory engram. Here, we hypothesize that motor learning induces synaptic
plasticity in the corticostriatal motor engram neurons, which is crucial for the formation and consolidation of
motor memory. In this proposal, using approaches combining such genetic tools to label and manipulate motor
engram neurons with electrophysiology, ex vivo and in vivo 2-photon imaging, and single-cell RNA-
sequencing, we aim to investigate how corticostriatal circuit adapts during motor learning at molecular, cellular,
and circuit levels. The major goals are: 1: To investigate cortical and striatal excitatory synaptic plasticity of
motor engram neurons. 2: To examine how motor learning affects the structure and function of corticostriatal
projections. 3. To determine the molecular mechanism underlying corticostriatal synaptic plasticity induced by
motor learning. Success in the proposed experiments will provide an in-depth, mechanistic understanding of
synaptic plasticity and integration in the corticostriatal circuits. Given the fundamental role of synaptic plasticity
in the learning and execution of motor skills and maladaptive cortical and striatal synaptic plasticity seen in
movement disorders, our findings may further contribute to future strategies to more effectively treat these
diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease."
10862637,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of
Americans, yet there is no cure, and there are very limited treatment options. Failure of otherwise promising
drugs for AD may be due, in part, to poor penetration into the brain and/or large systemic dose requirements to
achieve therapeutic brain concentrations, resulting in off-target effects. To address blood brain barrier (BBB)
impenetrability, ultrasound-targeted microbubble cavitation (UTMC) is being explored as a new treatment
strategy for AD. In this approach, low intensity ultrasound is applied to intravenously injected ultrasound contrast
agents (microbubbles) as they traverse the microcirculation of the brain. UTMC causes transient endothelial
barrier hyperpermeability, allowing for site-specific delivery of therapeutics across the BBB. While UTMC shows
promise as a technique to increase BBB permeability, its underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood,
ultimately constraining clinical translation. My overarching goal is that UTMC directed to the brain offers an
approach to enhance drug delivery across the BBB for treatment of AD. To facilitate clinical translation of this
platform, my proposal will determine mechanisms mediating UTMC-induced BBB hyperpermeability and utilize
UTMC for delivering therapeutics directed at Ab plaques in vivo in the following Aims: (1) To identify
mechanisms by which UTMC causes transient BBB hyperpermeability. UTMC applied to umbilical vein
endothelial cells in vitro has been shown to change cytoskeletal dynamics, leading to inter-endothelial cell gaps,
which can increase paracellular permeability, and was associated with Ca2+ influx into cells in contact with, and
remote from, cavitating microbubbles. Extending these findings to the BBB, I hypothesize that UTMC-mediated
Ca2+ influx disrupts tight and adherens junctions between brain microvascular endothelial cells, and may also
lead to Ca2+-mediated changes in adjacent astrocytes. A contact co-culture in vitro transwell model of the BBB
will be used to study changes in function and structure (confocal microscopy) of endothelial cells and astrocytes
after UTMC. (2) To determine whether UTMC-mediated BBB opening, in combination with drug therapy,
will lower Ab plaque burden and improve the therapeutic window. I hypothesize that UTMC-mediated BBB
opening will decrease the dose required for a specific drug designed to lower Ab plaque deposition, thereby
minimizing off-target effects. The drug will be administered, and UTMC will be applied to the brain in a mouse
model of AD. Brain Ab plaques will be quantified by serial brain PET imaging. I have assembled an exceptional
multidisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators, along with specific coursework and seminars, to acquire the
necessary content expertise in AD biology, ultrasound theranostics, imaging, and murine AD models. Through
meetings with my mentors and conducting my experiments, I will acquire experiential lessons in rigorous
experimental design, data analysis, and presentation. My comprehensive training plan will prepare me to
achieve my career goal of becoming a physician-scientist pursuing bench to bedside translational research."

Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens from contaminated food products including
Salmonella from poultry meat and Acinetobacter from shrimps is of great concern. Pennsylvania
is motivated to participate in National Antimicrobial Monitoring System (NARMS) retail food
surveillance for two reasons. First, the program will enable us to contribute to the FDA's
regulatory oversight for antibiotics, which directly benefits our residents. Second, it will enable
us to strengthen integrated surveillance for enteric bacteria by using whole genome sequencing
to compare bacteria from food samples with bacteria isolated from patients. This comparison
facilitates outbreak investigations, trace-back of contaminated products, and prioritization of
interventions such as facility inspections by regulators. Analyses of integrated genomics data
from food and human sources will also enhance surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in
enteric bacteria. This project will result in better coordination and exchange of data and isolates
with the FDA and expand high resolution detection of and response to emerging drug-resistant
pathogens. improved timelines of the surveillance system. Additionally, our efforts will
improve data quality and completeness of records and will support the use of NARMS findings
to improve One Health antimicrobial stewardship in food production and healthcare settings."

The establishment of left-right (LR) asymmetry is a critical event required for the correct positioning of internal
organs. Defects in human LR axis formation cause birth defects of the heart, vasculature, lungs, and intestinal
tract. The gene network contributing to the generation of LR asymmetry is highly conserved across
vertebrates. In the mouse, the initial asymmetric signals establishing LR axis are determined in the node by
cilia-driven leftward fluid flow (nodal flow). These signals are then transferred to the left lateral plate mesoderm
(LPM), which will undergo asymmetric organ morphogenesis. Nodal, a secretory protein that belongs to the
transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily, is expressed in the node and travels a long distance to the
left LPM, where it initiates a transient auto-regulatory circuit (involving Nodal and Lefty) that propagates Nodal
signaling and activates expression of the left-sided determinant Paired-Like Homeodomain transcription
factor 2 (Pitx2). The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway also plays a crucial role in LR patterning. In the mouse,
Hh signaling is required to establish the midline that separates the left and right sides of the embryo, as well as
to activate the Nodal-dependent auto-regulatory circuit in the LPM. However, the mechanism by which Hh
signaling regulates the competence of the LPM for Nodal response is not well understood. Thus, identifying the
specific convergence point of the Hh and TGF-b pathways is critical for understanding the in-depth mechanism
underlying LR asymmetry determination, and therefore to provide better diagnosis, preventive and therapeutic
intervention against
LR asymmetry-related birth defects.
We recently found that a novel target of the Hh pathway, Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Ndnf),
regulates axial rotation and intestinal looping in the mouse. In the proposed work, we will incorporate
biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches to (Aim 1) assess the source, (Aim 2) determine the
transcriptional regulation, and (Aim 3) investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of Ndnf in LR
determination."

10839409,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly one in five children in the United States are affected by obesity. Beyond the adverse impact on physical,
social, and emotional wellbeing in childhood, children with obesity are at greater risk of obesity in adulthood. A
recent simulation study projects that 57% of today’s children will have obesity at age 35, placing them at higher
risk of cardiometabolic disease, obesity-related cancers, and early mortality. Effective interventions that
prevent and treat obesity in childhood can disrupt these projected trends, improve long-term health and quality
of life, and reduce later health care utilization and costs. Bright Bodies, a high-intensity, family-based
intervention for childhood obesity, was found to have the greatest magnitude of mean reduction in body mass
index among U.S.-based childhood obesity interventions evaluated in the 2017 U.S. Preventive Task Force
Report. There is tremendous potential for population-level impact on obesity outcomes if Bright Bodies is
successfully scaled-up nationally, yet little is known about adoption, implementation, and effectiveness at the
39 sites to which the Bright Bodies curriculum has been disseminated over the last decade. Through this
award, we aim to capitalize on advances in the field of implementation science to conduct an observational
evaluation of the naturalistic dissemination and implementation of the Bright Bodies intervention. The results of
this mixed methods study of historical dissemination sites will be used to optimize the Bright Bodies
implementation package though user-centered design methods. The newly-optimized package will be
prospectively implemented at three heterogenous sites reflecting low-income populations with racial/ethnic,
rural-urban, and geographic diversity. The scientific objectives of the proposed award are to conduct a hybrid
type 2 effectiveness-implementation and cost-effectiveness study in which we will employ multiphase mixed
methods to assess implementation processes and effectiveness outcomes simultaneously while also
examining contextual factors that may mediate and modify implementation impact and effectiveness. To
achieve these aims, we have assembled a transdisciplinary team with expertise in obesity treatment,
implementation science, mixed methods, community engaged research, cost-effectiveness analysis, and user-
centered design. The results from this study will provide an optimized, user-centered implementation package
for Bright Bodies as well as valuable evidence on the implementation and effectiveness of the intervention in
different settings to facilitate broad-scale dissemination and to enhance sustainability."
10839416,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt loss of kidney function that occurs in 25-59% of children hospitalized with
severe malaria. AKI is one of the strongest risk factors for death in children with severe malaria and is associated
with long-term cognitive and kidney problems. Following injury, the kidney undergoes a repair process to restore
normal kidney function. If the repair process goes awry and is ‘maladaptive’, it can lead to persistent kidney injury
and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our previous studies showed an increased risk of CKD in severe malaria
survivors. These results led to our central hypothesis that persistent activation of pathways associated with
severe malaria associated-AKI contributes to maladaptive repair following AKI and increases CKD risk. Towards
this hypothesis, we have preliminary data showing that persistent immune activation and signs of altered blood
vessel function are associated with persistent kidney disease at one-month follow-up. An estimated 15.6% of
Ugandan children have persistent kidney injury after severe malaria with 17.5% of children with persistent kidney
injury dying within one-year follow-up compared to 3.7% without AKI. Guided by strong preliminary data, we
propose a prospective multi-site observational cohort study to follow 750 Ugandan children, 90 days to 15 years
of age, hospitalized with severe malaria to assess the incidence of CKD. We will also enroll 189 community
children of the same age to define the incidence of CKD in Ugandan children. We will pursue two Specific Aims
to evaluate the malaria-associated pathogenesis of acute and chronic kidney disease (MAP-CKD) after severe
malaria. In Aim 1, we will determine clinical risk factors associated with CKD, including the severity and duration
of AKI as well as a poorly understood complication of malaria called blackwater fever. We will also evaluate the
genetic risk factors for CKD in children over follow-up, focusing on genes linked to kidney disease (e.g., APOL1)
or protection from severe malaria (e.g., sickle cell anemia). In Aim 2, we will focus on defining mechanisms of
maladaptive repair following AKI by measuring biomarkers in children’s blood and urine over follow-up. These
studies will have the potential to uncover pathways of maladaptive repair following AKI that lead to the
development of CKD and are amenable to intervention. Our long-term goal is to prevent children from developing
CKD. These studies will achieve this goal by allowing us to identify children at the highest risk of CKD, providing
clinical follow-up and early treatment for CKD. Secondly, by determining the maladaptive nature of the healing
process, we will be able to use biomarkers to identify children at risk of CKD. Third, these studies have the
potential to identify treatments to promote adaptive renal repair and reduce CKD development. Collectively, our
proposed research will provide new insights into kidney disease in malaria and may provide novel insights into
mechanisms of maladaptive repair in other conditions characterized by intravascular hemolysis and AKI. The
results from this study will help define the burden of CKD following AKI in low-and-middle-income countries,
where 80% of global AKI deaths occur."
10850837,"The concept of Precision Medicine builds on the age-old understanding that humans vary in their disease
susceptibility, presentation, progression, and therapeutic response. Modern large data analytics reveal that most
of us have “average” susceptibility for most diseases, but each of us has high risk for a few. This finding provides
the opportunity and challenge – addressed by this eMERGE Genomic Risk Assessment and Management
(eMERGEgram) initiative – to identify people at high risk for common diseases to promote prevention or early
treatment. We propose here a program that builds on over a decade of growth and knowledge in key enabling
disciplines including informatics, genomics, bioethics, participant and community engagement, and clinical
medicine, and of experience as productive participants in eMERGE since the network's inception. In Specific
Aim 1, we will develop and validate Genomic Risk Assessment tools to identify people at high risk for common
diseases. The Genomic Risk Assessments will incorporate polygenic risk scores, family health history, and
clinical disease predictors. We propose that the eMERGEgram Steering Committee select diseases that are
heritable; display variable impact across ancestries; are associated with available early detection, prevention or
treatment interventions; and in which large multi-ancestry genome wide association studies are available to
develop polygenic risk scores. Using these criteria, we present data that support a focus on coronary artery
disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, uterine fibroids, and colorectal cancer. In Specific Aim 2, we
will build on experience in eMERGE-3, All of Us, and our NIH-supported Recruitment Innovation Center to
execute a program that will engage, recruit, and retain 2,500 subjects (>35% from populations under-represented
in biomedical research), including family dyads or trios. We will compute Genomic Risk Assessments for network-
selected target conditions; return results to participants, their healthcare providers, and their electronic health
records; and track healthcare outcomes including disease detection or healthcare utilization and deliver these to
the Coordinating Center. In Specific Aim 3, we will use the eMERGEgram experience to improve our ability to
deliver Genomic Risk Assessment. We will assess the uptake and impact of Genomic Risk Assessments and
the extent to which the components of the Genomic Risk Assessment provide independent information across
populations and within subgroups. We will use a shared DNA segment map across >100,000 records in our
biobank to develop the concept of a genetically-informed family history, a tool that can inform health risk in the
absence of a large pedigree, as is the case for small or adoptive families. Additional research goals will be
driven by participants, developed through community engagement by focus groups in Years 1-2 and highly
intentional participant interaction throughout the project."
10850840,"ABSTRACT
Fetal complete (i.e., 3°) atrioventricular block (AVB), identified in the 2nd trimester in an otherwise normally
developing heart, is almost universally associated with maternal anti-Ro autoantibodies and carries a high
morbidity and mortality. It has been speculated that full expression of conduction disease results in orderly
progression from normal rhythm (NR) to 1° AVB [prolonged AV interval assessed by echocardiogram (echo)], to
2° AVB (irregular cardiac rhythm or bradycardia), culminating in 3° AVB. Identification of a transition period,
marked by an irregular rhythm and/or bradycardia, may be the only window of opportunity for treatment to restore
NR. Thus, current surveillance employing weekly echos would fall short. We have now shown that daily fetal
heart rate and rhythm monitoring (FHRM) by the mother with confirmation of abnormal findings by echo is
feasible and affords rapid and successful treatment with no cases of AVB missed. The proposal combines
expertise of fetal cardiologist Bettina F. Cuneo, MD (University of Colorado–Denver), rheumatologist Jill P.
Buyon, MD (NYU School of Medicine), and 33 sites, to address the hypotheses that early treatment is critical,
FHRM reduces the need for weekly echos, and surveillance can be limited to mothers with high-titer antibodies.
This prospective trial involves three sequential Steps: 1) Screening for high titer anti-Ro60 or Ro52 centrally in
Dr. Buyon's lab; 2) Surveillance by FHRM 3X daily and weekly echo; 3) Treatment of 2° AVB identified by FHRM
confirmed by echo. FHRM supported by echo will be leveraged to affirm the efficacy of rapid treatment of 2° AVB
and incidence/outcome of AV interval prolongation as well as extra-nodal disease. By identifying 850 high-titer
anti-Ro pregnancies in Step 1, FHRM in Step 2, and a single arm multicenter trial in Step 3, Aim 1 will determine
whether expeditious treatment of 2° AVB restores NR. Mothers detecting an abnormal FHRM confirmed to
be 2° AVB will be treated in ≤12 hours of detection with a potent dual anti-inflammatory approach,
dexamethasone and IVIG, the primary outcome being percentage of treated fetuses whose rhythm regresses to
NR. A sample size of 30 fetuses with 2° AVB ensures at least 80% power to detect an increase in the rate of
reversal to NR from 25% (historical control rate) to 50% with treatment. Women with low-titer anti-Ro will not
enter the Step 2-FHRM phase, but birth ECGs will be collected. Aim 2 assesses the incidence and natural
history of a fetal prolonged AV interval ≤170 milliseconds (ms). Treatment of AV intervals >170ms will also
be evaluated. Aim 3 assesses the incidence and outcome of fetuses with isolated extra-nodal cardiac
disease. Impact: Strong preliminary data, interdisciplinary collaboration and national expertise support our
application of the NICHD “Consortium Model” Network in providing a unique opportunity to reverse
inflammatory/fibrotic sequelae of anti-Ro thereby preventing lifelong disability. It is anticipated that this study will
decrease 3° AVB, yield evidence-based management guidelines, set precedent for universal pre-natal screening
for anti-Ro, reduce costlier echo surveillance, and empower mothers in their own health care."

Acute disasters like hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, and wildfires, as well as gradual-onset environmental
events like sea level rise and coastal erosion, are growing in frequency and severity. These events
disproportionately affect the health and well-being of older adults (65+) due to chronic health conditions,
cognitive limitations, and depleted social networks. Across all age groups, older adults are the least likely to be
prepared for disasters, are the most at-risk during all phases of a disaster (e.g., mitigation, preparedness;
response; recovery) and, they have the highest rate of disaster-related deaths. In addition to increasing the
morbidity and mortality of older adults, disaster exposure can also disrupt the ability of community-dwelling
older adults to successfully age. Despite their vulnerability, disaster resilience interventions and activities are
not usually tailored for community-dwelling older adults. The rapidly growing older adult population—along with
the mounting risk of disasters—makes it imperative to understand the factors that influence older adult
resilience in the context of disasters (e.g., disaster resilience) and how this adaptive process can be nurtured
to promote successful aging (SA). The main research objective of this career development award is to
generate data that will inform future R-level awards, led by the candidate, that address resilience-building
strategies to promote SA, despite growing disaster risk. This proposed research aims to promote successful
aging by identifying the factors that increase the disaster resilience of community-dwelling older adults, and
subsequently leveraging these factors in the design and piloting of an intervention for those aging in disaster-
prone areas. We hypothesize that a direct relationship between disaster exposure and SA can be mediated by
increased disaster resilience. To test this hypothesis, the broad goals of this project are to (1) test a conceptual
model that theorizes the relationship among disaster exposure, individual disaster resilience and SA; (2)
identify the factors that contribute to disaster resilience among older adults with qualitative data; and (3) design
and pilot an intergenerational intervention that aims to increase disaster resilience among community-dwelling
older adults. The main training objective of this CDA is to provide the PI with skills in (1) advanced quantitative
methods; and (2) intervention science. The mentoring team includes an exceptional multidisciplinary group of
scholars with expertise in intervention design and implementation; social gerontology; public health disaster
science; resilience theory; and biostatistics. To accomplish these goals, the PI and mentoring team have co-
designed a training plan with didactic, mentored, and experiential learning that will provide the PI with
dedicated time to focus on research, dissemination of findings, and the collection of pilot data to inform future
research. With mentorship from her team of senior researchers, additional coursework, and applied
experience, the PI will be able to transition into a successful independent researcher who can effectively bridge
gerontology, public health disaster science, and intervention science."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia accompanied by detrimental cognitive
deficits and pathological accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. The
majority of AD cases occur late in life, and it usually develops after 65 years of age. The strongest genetic risk
factor for late-onset AD (LOAD) is apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, with the ε4 allele increasing AD risk and
the ε2 allele being protective compared with the common ε3 allele. Increasing evidence indicates that down-
regulation of apoE4 protein level and/or inhibition of apoE4 aggregation not only alleviate amyloid pathology but
also protect against tau-mediated neurodegeneration. In our preliminary studies, we have developed an apoE4
reporter assay with a split luciferase protein-fragment complementation, enabling us to not only monitor apoE4
protein level but also measure apoE4 self-oligomerization/aggregation by luciferase bioluminescent signals in a
high-throughput screening format. Under the support of the Mayo-SBP (Sanford Burnham Prebys) Drug
Discovery Collaboration Program, we performed a pilot screen of ~17,000 small molecule compounds with
satisfactory performance, and discovered a novel apoE4 modulator that down-regulates apoE4 protein level and
inhibits tau phosphorylation in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cerebral organoids from AD patient
carrying APOE4, demonstrating that our HTS assay is robust and capable of identifying novel apoE4 modulators.
Herein, we proposed a collaborative effort to identify apoE4 modulators that down-regulate apoE4 protein level
and/or suppress apoE4 aggregation for AD therapy. Aim 1 will complete the apoE4 reporter high-throughput
screen on a large chemical library to identify potent and specific apoE4 modulators for suppressing apoE4 level
and/or aggregation. Aim 2 will examine the potency, modes of actin (MOA), and therapeutic effects of apoE4
modulators using biochemical and cell-based assays and human iPSC-derived cellular models. Aim 3 will
perform SAR-by-catalog and limited chemistry on lead compounds to improve their potency and efficacy and
determine the therapeutic efficacy of the most promising candidate compounds in 3-D cerebral organoid models
such that our findings may have relevance in a humanized setting. Moreover, the “drug-like” and
pharmacokinetics properties and brain penetration will be characterized and benchmarked to position them for
future in vivo preclinical animal studies. The identified apoE4 modulators will be promising drug leads in novel
therapeutic strategies for AD."

The U.S. is currently facing a drug addiction (DA) epidemic while there is a dearth of innovative
technologies for preventing, diagnosing and treating DA and substance use disorders (SUDs).
The program on Entrepreneurship and Innovation for Biomedical Product Development
(EI4BPD) aims to advance the inception and development of products and services to develop,
scale, and deliver effective prevention, diagnostic and treatment solutions for substance use
disorders by training life science researchers in entrepreneurship, innovation, biomedical
product development and commercialization.
Specifically, this program will: 1) Combine the expertise of entrepreneurship, innovation, DA,
and education scholars toward a customized and unified curriculum in entrepreneurship, early-
stage biomedical technology commercialization and biomedical product development. 2) Recruit
4 consecutive yearly cohorts of 15 fellows, who are U.S. scientists working in the fields of SUDs
research, to receive, free of charge the training on how to foster the development of early-stage
biomedical technologies and how to advance their technologies from the research and
academic laboratory into the commercial world. The selection will occur through a highly
competitive process. 3) Implement the developed curriculum as an educational program
consisting of tailored online (live and self-paced) and in-person educational activities driven by
coaches from academia, government and industry. 4) Create a Community of Peers for all
SUDs researchers and industry experts to provide program sustainability and a space for ideas’
cross-pollination.
The educational program will consist of a kickoff event to promote community building and set
the program’s goals. It will be followed by two online courses on innovation and
entrepreneurship covering user understanding and technology evaluation. The courses will be
complemented by tailored live webinars and online support activities. Finally, the program will
be concluded with an in-person hands-on bootcamp on entrepreneurship and innovation for
biomedical product development facilitated by practicing biomedical entrepreneur and
pharmacotherapy coaches. Each new cohort will be supported by a variety of industry experts,
speakers and coaches that will be part of a Community of Peers, which will grow every year to
keep all alumni connected to support future biomedical product development efforts."
10851842,"Craniofacial dysmorphologies are some of the most common human birth defects and can be extremely
variable in their severity and extent. Understanding, diagnosing and treating these dysmorphologies requires a
detailed understanding of the normal genetic hierarchies, cell signaling and cellular interactions that drive the
morphogenesis and integration of the multiple cell types within the craniofacial complex. Genetic and/or
environmental perturbations that disrupt these normal processes can cause craniofacial dysmorphologies.
Given that human craniofacial birth defects tend to be sporadic and non-syndromic, it is most likely that
multifactorial perturbations are the most common cause of these defects. However, there are major gaps in our
understanding of the normal processes in craniofacial development. Furthermore, we have very little
understanding of how multifactorial interactions disrupt normal development.
This R35 proposal will support the unique research program of Dr. Johann Eberhart’s lab. The signaling
interactions mediating craniofacial morphogenesis are examined in the first program. The second program
examines how craniofacial tissues integrate seamlessly with one another. The third program examines the
environmental and gene-environment interactions that can disrupt craniofacial development.
Dr. Eberhart is an extremely well trained and productive developmental biologist. He has been supported
through various NIH-based mechanisms ever since he was an undergraduate student. He has authored 40

10851844,"There is great need to develop systems in which the course for initiation and progression of cancer, and therapies
directed at these steps can be studied directly in mouse and human cells, and over time courses relevant to real
world tumorigenesis. While engineered mouse models are valuable, there is a need to develop complementary
systems where meaningful, relatively rapid in-vitro work can yield substantial pre-clinical insights leading to final
animal testing. In this regard, we have developed an organoid model which is yielding important data for studying
the age-related risks for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). The studies build on extensive data, now just in
press, derived from mouse organoids from normal proximal colon wherein we have modeled key steps in the
initiation and progression of CRC. The key findings are that despite the organoids being genetically stable over
time, they evolve an abnormal, gene promoter CpG island phenotype (CIMP) during long periods of growth. This
pattern is very similar to changes seen with aging in normal human colon and which parallels the increasing
CRC risk with age. CIMP involves repression of associated gene expression, and/or perhaps even more
importantly affects inducibility of genes which otherwise normally function in a feedback fashion to blunt abnormal
WNT and other stem pathway activation, prevent abnormal retention of cell renewal, and induce differentiation.
In this context, induction of Braf mutations in the older versus younger organoids result in a much more rapid
evolution of autonomous Wnt pathway activation, stem cell versus differentiation features and one-step
transformation by oncogenic Braf. The resulting cancers have typical histologic features and the epigenetic
abnormality of CIMP resembling oncogenic BRAF-driven human proximal colon CRCs. Critically, CRISPR-
mediated simultaneous inactivation of multiple CIMP target genes in young organoids rapidly converts these to
the old organoid phenotype, importantly resulting in rapid one-step transformation by oncogenic Braf. In the
current proposal, we will determine the role of genes affected by age-related CIMP in driving human CRC in the
context of KRAS, BRAF and APC mutations, thus addressing the epigenetic dependency of ~75% of CRC
evolution. This includes extrapolating our studies to human colon organoids. Importantly, our unique models
provide a novel setting to test whether epigenetic therapies can alter the above evolution of CIMP to suppress
age-related changes, which may otherwise enhance CRC risk. Results from these studies may allow insights for
strategies to prevent and/or intercept CRC evolution.
All of the work in our proposal has potential to define management strategies for CRC prevention and
interception, which could prove especially valuable for decreasing CRC risk in individuals harboring familial germ
line predisposition to colon polyps and for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."
10851846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use is a major public health concern that disproportionately affects individuals from socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds. We propose the mechanistic hypothesis that childhood socioeconomic
disadvantage and other aspects of social inequality leads to neurobehavioral deviations, measurable in brain
structure/functioning and neurocognitive performance, that increases vulnerability to problematic substance use.
Critically, the vast majority of research has been cross-sectional and relied upon small, underpowered samples
of middle/upper-class White participants. In this secondary data analysis proposal, we leverage existing datasets
from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family
Research (MCTFR), population-representative samples prospectively assessed at multiple time points during
adolescence (ABCD) and from adolescence into adulthood (MCTFR). Multimodal and comparable
structural/functional MRI assessments in both the ABCD and MCTFR cohorts allow us to develop and validate
a processing pipeline for generating polyneuro risk scores indexing self-regulation abilities using whole-brain
association studies (BWAS). Longitudinal and comprehensive assessments in both the ABCD and MCTFR
cohorts allow us to examine whether these polyneuro risk scores mediate associations between childhood
socioeconomic disadvantage and substance use trajectories in adolescence and adulthood, and assessments
in both the ABCD and MCTFR cohorts, including family and community resources, household income,
educational attainment, occupation, discrimination, and COVID-related stressors, allow us to examine whether
more proximal experiences of social inequality in adolescence and adulthood affect substance use trajectories
beyond effects of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage. The racially/ethnically representative ABCD cohort
allows us to further examine whether socioeconomic status shows smaller effects for racial/ethnic minority
children than White children—the marginalization-related diminished returns phenomenon. Finally, the unique
twin family samples in both the ABCD and MCTFR cohorts allow co-twin control analyses that control for shared
familial confounders, permitting stronger causal inference than possible in samples of singletons. Understanding
effects of socioeconomic disadvantage and other aspects of social inequality on substance use trajectories is
more important now than ever, given rising income inequality in the United States and the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, which disproportionately affects individuals and families from socioeconomically disadvantaged and
racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Identifying individuals and families at the greatest risk for problematic
substance use trajectories, and, critically, identifying the social and economic factors that potentially confer
causal risk, will inform the development of the most targeted, and therefore most efficient, cost-effective, and
efficacious, prevention and intervention efforts possible for substance misuse and use disorder."
10838572,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of our proposal is to investigate how iron metabolism and erythropoietic activity are interrelated,
and the mechanisms whereby dysregulation in one contributes to pathophysiology in the other. Roles for the two
transferrin receptors in these processes is clear; however, little is understood regarding the signaling properties
of their ligand, transferrin. Transferrin has long been recognized to deliver iron by binding to receptor, transferrin
receptor 1 (TFR1), present on all cells. More recently, a homologous receptor, TFR2, has been identified almost
exclusively on bone marrow and liver cells where it serves as a sensor of iron supply and a regulator of
erythropoiesis. We generated mice in which one or other of the two iron binding sites (N and C) was mutated,
and unable to take in iron. We observed striking differences in the regulation of iron metabolism and
erythropoiesis between these mice, demonstrating that each of lobes of transferrin has distinct signaling
properties. We present in this proposal new data demonstrating significant improvement in a mouse model of
the human disease β-thalassemia when iron is specifically bound to the N but not C lobe. We now devote our
attention to the mechanisms by which the two transferrin lobes exert their effects. We also explore the potential
of increasing N lobe TF as a potential treatment approach in ineffective erythropoiesis."
10839386,"The state of Florida’s high ethnic and racial diversity provides a unique platform to address an array of scientific
and clinical questions to refine our current understanding of how AD+ADRD present and progress among the
nation’s diverse cultural groups. Moreover, early detection has become a global priority, given that identifying
individuals at-risk for disease during the pre-symptomatic phases may yield the greatest efficacy in emerging
treatments in AD+ADRD clinical trials. Thus, the 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center has placed a
special emphasis on recruiting diverse individuals during the preclinical (preMCI) or prodromal (early MCI)
phases, which is of significant value for longitudinal follow up studies. The 1Florida ADRC addresses these major
national priorities, represents our demographic landscape, and leverages the scientific expertise of our
investigators. The 1Florida ADRC ORE Core’s objectives are to actively facilitate community and professional
outreach and education programs so that our Clinical and Neuropathology Cores and affiliated researchers can
enroll individuals who are interested in helping develop ways to better assess, treat and prevent AD+ADRD,
particularly people from underserved and underrepresented minority communities. We propose to achieve this
by i) assembling a racially and ethnically diverse team, ii) further developing, strengthening, and empowering
our academic-community partners, iii) developing and implementing culturally appropriate and dual language
outreach and educational materials, iv) broadening our communications with stakeholders in a more “live”
manner through in-person reciprocal dialogue, and v) serve as cross-cultural experts to support the training of
emerging clinician scientists and other professionals through the REC. In the current application, we are
strengthening and expanding our partnerships with a focus on more actively engaging stakeholders from minority
communities to be involved in the “1Florida ADRC Ambassadors Council”. The feedback of our Ambassadors
will allow us to implement pragmatic and effective methods for community engagement in the Hispanic and AA
communities in a manner that resonates with our diverse cultural groups. Ultimately, the success of our
strategies and programs will be reflected in recruitment and retention rates, especially in the specifically targeted
diverse populations. The ORE Core will work closely with the Data Management Core and Clinical Core, to
deploy tools to capture data that will evaluate all activities. Our success will also be measured by maintaining
an engaged and satisfied cadre of Ambassadors that are representatives of our diverse community, as well as
a notable expansion of sustained platforms for outreach and education throughout the state. Importantly, the
ORE team has significant cross-cultural expertise that will be valuable for providing training to RE component to
ensure that our knowledge about effective practices to engage, assess and treat underrepresented minorities is
made available to emerging clinician scientists and other ADRC teams that are working with similar populations."
10839387,"SUMMARY: Biomarker Core
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) classically develops in the elderly. The classical way to confirm an AD diagnosis is the
presence of amyloid deposition and tau pathology at post-mortem; however in-vivo biomarkers can serve as
proxies of these characteristics and are invaluable in separating healthy aging from AD as well as placing
individuals along the AD continuum. The Biomarker Core works closely with the three Clinical Core sites across
Miami and Gainesville, as well as the Data Core to provide timely access to raw, pre-processed, and post-
processed data. The Aims of this Biomarker Core include: 1) Web-based Neuroimaging Portal for Accessing,
Visualizing, and Sharing Multimodal Imaging Data. 2) Integrating New Imaging and Biofluid Modalities into the
Neuroimaging Portal. 3) Multimodal, Multiclass, and Machine Learning Algorithms of Imaging and Biofluid
Markers. 4) Provide Support for Ongoing and Future R01, U01, REC, K01, K99, T32, and F32 grants across the
network of Florida and non-Florida Projects. There is a rich and expansive group of grants that will be able to
leverage the biomarker datasets acquired within the Clinical Core, including those funded as part of the Research
and Education Core (REC). This core will provide the needed communication, data sharing, analysis support,
and neuroimaging training for research in these projects to proceed. We believe that this study, which would be
one of the largest of its kind, will combine data acquired at the Wien Center for Alzheimer’s Disease and Memory
Disorders, UM Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Aging, and University of Florida. Access to this new
multimodal dataset in AD and other dementias will provide added statistical meaningfulness in studying dementia
and inclusion of a large number of Hispanics and African Americans, which is much needed given the current
demographics of the popular ADNI database."
10839388,"The primary goal of the 1Florida ADRC Alzheimer’s Science Training to Advance Research Success (1FL
AlzSTARS) program is to train diverse, multidisciplinary Early Stage Investigators (ESIs). Junior faculty or
research associates from across the 1Florida ADRC consortium will be trained for leadership roles in research
translation especially with regards to diverse and underserved communities. Our premises for developing the
1FL AlzSTARS program include the understanding that AD and AD related disorders (AD+ADRD) researchers
from diverse disciplines 1) need a set of core competencies to contribute to the continually evolving field of 2)
should be trained in leadership and team science, 3) must understand concepts ranging from molecular
biology to population and implementation science 4) should be prepared to work in variety of settings and 5)
should be trained within a cohort of like-minded ESIs. The 1FL AlzSTARS program therefore has three aims
summarized as: 1) recruit and train a cohort of ten highly qualified ESIs 2) deliver an innovative,
collaborative, multi-institutional two-year program of coursework and mentored research experience 3)
evaluate the impact of the 1FL AlzSTARS program. Our scholars will be diverse with regard to gender,
ethnicity, SES, discipline, consortium site, translational research interests, and career plans, and disposed to
study diversity and disparity factors. The program will synthesize mentored research and professional
development experiences with three formal didactic foci i) AD+ADRD specific curriculum, ii) health equity
curriculum, iii) general C/T research curriculum. The University of Florida and University of Miami Clinical and
Translational Science Institutes (CTSIs) have created programs to support the transition of a range of
professionals to independent investigators (e.g. K-to-R programs) and to continue their development as
mentors and leaders in their fields. The 1FL AlzSTARS program will provide a critical conduit to focus these
CTSIs’ successes towards the development of clinician-scientists and basic scientists desiring translational
research careers in AD+ADRD. Finally we will deploy a careful evaluation process to assess 1FL AlzSTARS
program impacts including completion of didactic and experiential learning opportunities, mastery of core
competencies and best research practices, and most importantly scholar’s career trajectories, advancement,
and retention."
10839406,"ABSTRACT CORE A
The Geroscience hypothesis is based on the observation that healthspan decline toward the end of life often
presents with a single age-related illness that is followed by the rapid accumulation of age-related complications
over a relatively short period of time. According to this hypothesis, treating any one of these conditions without
treating the fundamental biology of aging will only result in its substitution by another. Although pneumonia
causes excess mortality in older people, most elderly patients with access to modern health care survive
However, in the year after hospital discharge these older pneumonia survivors have an increased risk of
developing age-related disorders including persistent lung injury, skeletal muscle dysfunction leading to
immobility, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, dementia and cognitive impairment. As such,
pneumonia is a gateway for the compounding morbidity that limits healthspan at the end of life. In the first cycle
of this award, we used unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to suggest age-related resilience can
be restored by partial inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism through the integrated stress response via Activating
Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). Core A will assist the PPG investigators as they test this central hypothesis of
this PPG through a highly integrated and innovative set of experiments by focusing on five Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. To support communication between the Project Investigators, the Core Leaders, Collaborating
investigators, and the Internal and External Advisory Committee members.
Specific Aim 2. To provide a structure for the sharing of materials and dissemination of information between the
Project Investigators, Core Leaders and their Collaborators.
Specific Aim 3. To provide financial and regulatory oversight to the Project and Core Leaders and coordinate
their interactions with Institutional Core Services.
Specific Aim 4. To disseminate the discoveries made by the program project investigators through publications,
presentations and the sharing of reagents and techniques to other institutions and other investigators.

10859433,"Summary / Abstract
 The nuclear Lamins are intermediate filament proteins that underlie the nuclear envelope. Lamins assemble
into bundled filaments that strengthen the nucleus and scaffold the genome. The LMNA locus encodes the Lamin
A and C proteins; hundreds of mutations to LMNA have been linked to more than 10 distinct syndromes,
collectively referred to as “laminopathies”. Disease-linked LMNA mutations are found in every domain of these
proteins, and no clear genotype-phenotype correlations exist. LMNA-linked laminopathies primarily afflict the
cardiovascular system, muscle, skin, connective tissue, bone, and fat. A major goal of our research program is
to determine why specific tissues are especially vulnerable to LMNA mutations while the Lamin A/C proteins are
broadly expressed.
 In this proposal, we present evidence that modulation of protein lifetime is a major novel axis that regulates
both the function of Lamin A/C and the effects of laminopathy mutations. We have discovered that the lifetime of
the Lamin A/C proteins varies over an order of magnitude across tissues, and these proteins are especially long-
lived in the tissues that are most vulnerable to laminopathies. In the devastating laminopathy Hutchinson-Gilford
progeria syndrome (HGPS), production of a toxic Lamin A isoform called “Progerin” disrupts nuclear function
and causes accelerated aging. We determined that this mutation further slows the turnover of Lamin A in the
diseased cardiovascular system, where it accumulates over time and interferes with the turnover of hundreds of
other proteins. These findings raise key questions that will be addressed by our Aims.
 Firstly, while hundreds of mutations to LMNA are linked to human disease, we do not yet know how these
other mutations affect Lamin A/C protein stability and/or aggregation within diseased tissues. We will leverage a
novel in vivo metabolic labeling approach that we developed to probe the effect of another laminopathy mutation
on protein turnover in the LmnaH222P mouse model (Aim 1). Secondly, we do not understand how Lamin A/C
protein lifetime is modulated across tissues or in disease states. Differences in protein folding and/or assembly
state often underlie differences in protein turnover rate, but we know very little about the structure of the Lamin
A/C polymers in the cellular milieu or how variable these are across different tissue contexts. In Aim 2, we will
use functional proteomics to probe the folded state of the Lamin A/C proteins in situ, and we will test the
hypothesis that Lamins sense mechanical information – such as tissue strain – to alter their folded state. Thirdly,
we know that the Lamins perform the important function of scaffolding heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery
into repressive lamina-associated domains (LADs), yet we do not understand the consequences of variable
Lamin A/C folded state on this Lamin function. In Aim 3, we will apply a novel genome binding analysis technique
to map LADs and to define their repressive function within healthy and diseased tissues."
10839720,"Project Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest membrane protein superfamily in the human
genome, with over 800 unique sequences. GPCR-mediated signaling pathways play a key role in all
physiological systems as well as many pathophysiological conditions and therefore represent important drug
targets. GPCRs have a seven-transmembrane-helix (7TM) topology and contain multiple binding sites for
orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators. Upon recognition of their native ligands receptors transmit signal
across the cell membrane to intracellular partner proteins, such as G proteins or β-arrestins. Developing a
detailed understanding of functional mechanisms of GPCRs and facilitating design of novel drugs with high
selectivity and potency require access to high-resolution three-dimensional structures, determination of which,
however, remains a challenging task. We propose here a comprehensive research program which combines
technology development with integrated structure-function studies focused on GPCR superfamily. The proposed
research directions are designed to accelerate high-resolution structure determination of membrane proteins,
improve our understanding of GPCR superfamily and answer specific questions on ligand specificity and
selectivity as well as molecular mechanisms of action using several specific receptors as targets. Our approach
integrate structural information on new receptors and complexes with data obtained from biophysical,
biochemical and functional experiments through computer-based analysis and modeling. The long-term goal of
our laboratory is to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of GPCR using the
tools of structural biology and to apply the achieved insights towards the design and development of novel and
efficacious therapeutics."

This Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is designed to provide Dr. Tené T. Lewis
with protected time and other support to: 1) advance her current program of research, focused on
understanding how social stressors contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in underrepresented and
understudied groups of women; 2) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior patient-oriented
researchers across disciplines, with an emphasis on trainees historically underrepresented in research (e.g.
racial/ethnic minority scientists); 3) enhance her mentoring skills, with a particular focus on transdisciplinary
approaches and best-practices in providing mentoring and support to underrepresented groups; and 4) obtain
training in the examination of biomarkers of ovarian aging, as emerging risk factors for CVD in women.
Mentoring activities will leverage Dr. Lewis’ ongoing involvement in several training programs at Emory
University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health inequities
that she co-directs, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the
Master of Public Health and PhD programs in Epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Mentoring
training will occur via workshops and regular consultation with senior investigators with established track
records in mentoring of patient-oriented researchers from a range of disciplinary and sociodemographic
backgrounds. Training in ovarian aging will build upon Dr. Lewis’ existing collaborations at Emory and with the
Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Finally, the science proposed in the award will extend
Dr. Lewis’ research in critically important new directions, by examining ovarian aging as a biologically plausible
mechanism that might further contribute to our understanding of how social stressors impact subclinical CVD in
vulnerable subgroups of women (particularly African-American women) highlighting processes occurring at
midlife, when excess rates are most pronounced."
10840804,"SUMMARY
Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease, estimated to affect 240 million people worldwide, leading
to loss of a minimum of 1.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) annually – 90% of this burden in sub-
Saharan Africa. In East Africa, Uganda has a strong track-record of seminal studies and partnerships on
schistosomiasis research. The Uganda Schistosomiasis Multidisciplinary Research Center (U-SMRC) will
build on this solid foundation to develop a vibrant, Uganda-led, Uganda-based international schistosomiasis
research network that fosters African capacity for transformative tropical medicine research.
Uganda is highly endemic for Schistosoma mansoni (Sm). Intestinal schistosomiasis is universal in many villages
around its Great Lakes and the River Nile. The Ministry of Health’s Vector Control Division (VCD), responsible
for schistosomiasis control, has long been concerned by the high rates of severe schistosomal morbidity in the
North-Western Lake Albert region (LA), compared to the Central and Eastern Lake Victoria region (LV), despite
comparable transmission and programmes of praziquantel mass drug administration. In response to this
concern, the U-SMRC’s core research goal is to understand the biological determinants of severe Sm-
associated morbidity and to identify better strategies for its prevention and control.
We hypothesise that key biological determinants of severe schistosomal morbidity occur at each stage of the
parasite’s life cycle: in the human host, in the parasite, and in the snail host and its environment. To investigate
this hypothesis, we will use two study designs: (i) cohorts of pre-school-age children (PSAC) in LA and LV, to
explore the early evolution of immune responses that may lead to severe morbidity and (ii) an adult case control
study to identify chronic exposures associated with severe disease. We will also collect parasite and snail
samples from both settings, and develop a specimen archive for future studies. Our specific aims will be to
Aim 1. Compare early-life immune responses to Sm exposure and infection between LA and LV and identify
co-exposures that modulate Sm-specific immune responses and morbidity risk
Aim 2. Establish a platform for local genetic surveillance of schistosome parasites in Uganda and determine
whether there is a parasite genetic basis to differences in clinical outcomes in LA and LV
Aim 3. Determine which population biological determinants of Biomphalaria spp. snails act as local
epidemiological drivers of Sm, filtering its diversity within and between LA and LV ecosystems; and whether
detection of environmental (e)DNA signatures from Biomphalaria and Sm can be used to better predict
snail/parasite diversity at transmission sites and (re)infection risk within key demographic groups
Data from each Aim will be used to develop a comprehensive, integrated model of the drivers of severe Sm-
associated morbidity. This model will be further utilised to evaluate likely benefits of selected interventions,
and to guide future policy on prevention and management."

Project Summary/Abstract
The Bureau of Maternal, Infant, and Reproductive Health (BMIRH) of the New York City (NYC)
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) proposes to continue the Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) in NYC. PRAMS is a surveillance system to identify and
monitor maternal experiences and behaviors around the time of pregnancy. The overall goal of
BMIRH is to achieve equitable and improved maternal, infant, and reproductive health outcomes in
NYC. Three overarching objectives are to: 1) reduce racial and ethnic inequities in infant mortality; 2)
reduce racial and ethnic inequities in preventable severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality;
and 3) reduce racial and ethnic inequities in access to contraceptive information and services among
youth ages 13-19. Data gathered from PRAMS will be linked to items from the birth certificate,
offering a unique source of information on maternal, infant, and reproductive health in NYC.
Each month approximately 180 women who gave birth in the previous two to four months will be
randomly selected from NYC birth certificate records to participate in PRAMS. Women who give
birth to low birthweight infants (<2,500 grams) will be oversampled. Women will be contacted by
mail, with telephone follow-up for non-respondents. To ensure adequate participation, women will be
sent $20 cash with the first mailing of the survey. Additionally, the PRAMS survey will be available in
English, Spanish, and Chinese. The data collection cycle for each monthly sample will lasts up to 95
days. The DOHMH will contract with the Bloustein Center for Survey Research (BCSR) at Rutgers,
the State University of New Jersey, for data collection and management activities. BCSR has
experience working with several PRAMS jurisdictions and consistently produces high-quality data
while adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol.
PRAMS data will be weighted by CDC to represent NYC resident women giving birth in NYC. The
specific aims of the project are to use PRAMS data to inform NYC's priorities related to improving
maternal and infant health, and its choice of programs, policies, and activities toward that end.
PRAMS data will also serve as a NYC-specific data source for monitoring key Healthy People 2030
and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Maternal and Child Heath Bureau
indicators. The DOHMH will partner with academics, community groups, providers, government
agencies, and professional organizations to ensure PRAMS data are used to support programs and
policies to improve maternal and infant health."
10840182,"ABSTRACT
Research in our laboratory focuses on the mechanisms used by complexes required for transcriptional
‘memory’ during development. Development of complex large organisms requires that master
regulatory genes that specify a certain cell lineage be maintained in an ’on’ state throughout the lifetime
of an animal and that master regulatory genes that are inappropriate for expression in that lineage be
maintained in an ‘off’ state. This proposal is primarily focused on Polycomb-Group complexes,
especially Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which are key to maintaining the repressed state.
The Polycomb-Group (PcG) of genes was initially identified in 1947 by Pam Lewis using Drosophila
genetic screens. It was subsequently found to be conserved in vertebrates and to be essential for
developmental patterning. In humans, paralogs of the fly PcG proteins are frequently found in families
of complexes. The PRC1 family of complexes contains over 100 members with overlapping but distinct
compositions. These are subdivided into two large sub-families: The non-canonical PRC1 family
ubiquitylates histone H2A on lysine 119, the canonical PRC1 family compacts chromatin locally, forms
long-range interactions in the genome, and is found in condensates called ‘Polycomb bodies’ both in
vitro and in vivo.
This proposal focuses on functions of the core protein components of canonical PRC1 (cPRC1). The
two defining members of the cPRC1 family are one of the CBX proteins (usually CBX2, 4, 7 or 8) and
either PHC1 or PHC2. These proteins are known to be involved in phase separation into condensates,
local compaction (CBX2,4,8) and long-range interactions (both PHC proteins.) cPRC1 complexes also
contain a PCGF paralog and either RING1A or RING1B.
We propose to study the function of canonical PRC1 paralogs using four approaches:
The first set of experiments examines the ability of CBX and PHC proteins to generate condensates
when mixed with nucleosomal arrays in a purified in vitro system. We will use TIRF microscopy in a
protocol that allows visualization and quantification of single nucleosomal arrays, single cPRC1
complexes or sub-complexes, and the condensates that form containing both arrays and PRC1.
Dynamics of the condensates will be examined in real time, precise stoichiometries will be measured,
and properties will be compared between cPRC1 complexes with different compositions. This will
determine the contributions of different CBX and PHC proteins to condensate behavior. The ability of
these condensates to interfere with mammalian SWI/SNF function will be measured.
The second set of experiments will use a chemically inducible dimerization system in tissue culture
cells to add various distinct regions of proteins known to promote phase separation to a mutant CBX2
protein that no longer generates condensates. These experiments will determine whether addition of an
condensate forming region of an unrelated protein can rescue PRC1 biological function. These regions
come from proteins with no similarity in either amino acid sequence or function with PRC1 other than
the ability to form condensates. This will test the hypothesis that forming condensates per se is
important for the maintenance of repression.
The last two sets of experiments will investigate differences between paralogs of PRC1 components
during differentiation. Three CBX paralogs, CBX2, CBX4 and CBX8, have the same organization and
have similar in vitro functions. Single, double, and triple knockouts of these genes will be performed in
ES cells and the impact of those deletion on differentiation along a neuronal lineage pathway will be
characterized. This will uncover the extent to which these proteins are redundant or have differing
capabilities during differentiation. The ability of various PRC1 paralogs to function will also be
characterized using an organoid system that can differentiate into multiple distinct lineages. We will
determine which PRC1 components are expressed in which lineages during differentiation. We will then
use conditional knockout strategies to determine what role these components play during
differentiation.
These studies build on our thirty years of experience analyzing PRC1 function by evaluating which
mechanistic functions are necessary for appropriate developmental progression and hence are used in
the key biological role played by PRC1."

Intestinal fungi are an important component of the microbiota, and recent studies have unveiled their potential
in modulating inflammatory disease. Mucosal immunity to fungi has been largely explored in the context of oral,
skin, vaginal or lung infection. Nonetheless, the mechanisms governing immunity to gut fungi (mycobiota)
remain unknown. We have shown that a polymorphism in the human gene encoding the anti-fungal receptor
Dectin-1 (CLEC7A) is strongly associated with severity of ulcerative colitis and that, in a mouse models of
colitis and lung allergy, fungal dysbiosis can contribute to intestinal and lung inflammation. This suggests that
intestinal immunity to fungi may be an important factor in shaping host immunity.
As a central hub of mucosal immunity, the gastrointestinal tract is naturally equipped with a cellular machinery
to recognize and interact with the microbiota populating this body site. The intestines harbor several subsets of
phagocytes, which are known to respond to bacterial infections or to fluctuations in commensal bacterial
communities. These intestinal phagocyte subsets comprise of conventional dendritic cells (DCs), most of which
express the integrin CD103 albeit different levels of CD11b, and intestinal MNPs which express high levels of
CX3CR1. CX3CR1+ MNPs and CD103+ DCs have the potential to induce antigen specific T helper responses
to commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut. We and others have shown that Dectin-1/ CARD9 axis is
crucial for the induction of antifungal Th17 immunity at several barrier sites and can affect responses toward
intestinal mycobiota. However how intestinal phagocyte networks coordinate gut fungal sensing and immunity
to mycobiota is currently unknown.
It is becoming increasingly clear that an aberrant pro-inflammatory response to microbiota by infiltrating
monocytes plays a role in the development of intestinal inflammation. Our data show that intestinal
mononuclear phagocytes with characteristics of macrophages play an important role in limiting fungal
overgrowth in the gut, and can be influenced by the inflammatory environment to further propel inflammation.
We further show that a specific subset of CX3CR1+ gut mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) interacts with bona-
fide gut fungi to trigger innate and adaptive immune responses to fungi. Employing conditional knock out in
vivo models, model fungal strains, high-throughput platforms for fungal and bacterial sequencing, targeting of
fungi with drugs, and computational pipelines, we will define how phagocytes control immunity to fungi in the
gut to influence states of health and inflammatory disease. Better understanding of the interaction of intestinal
phagocytes with commensal fungi, would provide an opportunity for the development of more targeted
therapies for inflammatory diseases."

Premature birth necessitates interventions such as supplemental O2 (hyperoxia; typically <60% O2) with/without
respiratory support primarily using non-invasive nasal CPAP. Studies from the previous cycle of this longstanding
R01 have shown neonatal O2 is associated with development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and remodeling
(cell proliferation, fibrosis): effects that contribute to a wheezing phenotype and predispose to asthma. While
CPAP is initially beneficial, long-term effects on highly compliant bronchial airways are less known. We previously
found static stretch of CPAP induces sustained AHR and airway thickening even after CPAP is stopped and
involves airway smooth muscle (ASM). What we do not fully understand are upstream mechanosensitive
transducers of stretch, and downstream pathways by which O2 and stretch interact to produce these effects,
Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that mechanosensitive Piezo (PZ) channels in developing ASM
contribute to CPAP-induced AHR and remodeling. There are currently limited data on PZ channels in lung (which
does express them) and none in airways. Preliminary data show PZ1 and PZ2 are expressed in human fetal
ASM (fASM) and in neonatal mouse, and that PZs are functional in enhancing Ca2+ responses, proliferation and
ECM formation. 50% O2 and stretch each increase fASM PZ: effects also noted in newborn mice where 7 days
CPAP results in sustained AHR and remodeling at 3 wks, and inhibition of PZ blunts CPAP effects. Downstream
of PZ, we find that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is important, and can be increased by stretch/CPAP. Our
overall hypothesis/model is that in developing airways, ASM PZ channels and downstream Wnt/β-catenin
pathways are linked in the context of O2 and/or stretch effects, leading to AHR and remodeling. Our 3 Specific
Aims to explore our model are: Aim 1: Determine the role of PZ channels in O2- and stretch-induced responses
of human fASM; Aim 2: Determine mechanisms that mediate PZ effects in O2 and stretch-induced human fASM
responses; Aim 3: In a neonatal mouse model of O2 and CPAP, determine role of PZ in AHR and remodeling. In
Aims 1 and 2, 18-22 wk human fASM cells are exposed to normoxia vs. moderate hyperoxia with/without static
stretch on a background of cyclic strain, mimicking clinical application of O2 +/- CPAP in spontaneously breathing
premies. In Aim 1, complementary imaging and biochemical techniques are used with PZ modulators to assess
roles of PZ in fASM [Ca2+]i (imaging), contractility (traction force microscopy), proliferation and fibrosis. In Aim 2,
complementary biochemical and molecular tools are used to examine mechanisms that are involved in PZ effects
on remodeling in particular with a focus on Wnt/β-catenin. In vitro results are integrated in Aim 3 using clinically-
relevant neonatal mouse models of moderate hyperoxia (50% O2) with/without intermittent CPAP applied for the
first 1 wk followed by 2 wks recovery in WT and inducible smooth muscle PZ1 KO (sm-PZ1 KO) mice. Effects of
inhibiting PZ1 vs. PZ2 are tested towards establishing clinical significance of targeting these novel pathways to
alleviate adverse long-term effects of hyperoxia and CPAP."

Approximately 55% of the world’s population lives in cities, and the United Nations estimates that this number
will rise to 68% by 2050. Urban ethnobotany, the study of people’s traditional knowledge and use of plants in
cities, is increasingly important as people adapt their cultural traditions to changing environments. In New York
City (NYC), there have been several urban ethnobotany investigations with Caribbean immigrant groups.
However, there has yet to be an ethnobotanical survey that documents and botanically authenticates the
medicinal plants used in the Haitian community. Previous research in collaboration with women from the
Caribbean in NYC has identified plant species sold in Caribbean shops that have documented use for the
treatment of vaginal infections, including sexually transmitted infections and intravaginal cleansing, grouped here
as gynecological conditions. Several popular Caribbean plants, such as Jatropha curcas, Argemone mexicana,
and Bixa orellana, have recorded medicinal uses in Haitian ethnomedicine as well. These species, while well-
studied for their antibacterial properties, have not yet been analyzed for their effects on pathogenic bacteria in
the vagina or the protective vaginal microbiota. Ideally, plants used to treat these conditions would have
bioactivity against harmful bacteria with minimal disruption to the beneficial vaginal microflora. Natural product
research that considers interactions with pathogenic and beneficial bacteria, as well as the compounds
responsible, is on the forefront of addressing efficacy of medicinal plants for women’s health. I hypothesize that
traditional preparations of the identified species will vary in inhibition of the growth of pathogenic (Gardnerella
vaginalis) and beneficial (Lactobacillus) vaginal bacterial due to differences in specialized metabolites.
Furthermore, I hypothesize that there will be similarities in plants and women’s health practices between the
Haitian and other Caribbean communities in NYC, due to the shared flora in the Caribbean. The selected plant
species will be analyzed for their effects on disease-causing bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis as well as on
prominent beneficial Lactobacillus species found in the vagina. Plant extracts will also be compared to determine
variation in the composition of bioactive phytochemicals across preparations of different tissues, using LC-MS-
qToF and subsequent multivariate statistical analysis. An ethnobotanical survey with the Haitian community will
be used to further identify additional plant species used to treat gynecological conditions by Caribbean women
for continued laboratory studies. This data will enable cross-cultural comparisons with other Caribbean
communities in NYC, and will also assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced NYC Haitian women in
their use of medicinal plants for women’s health. Antibacterial natural products from plants that leave the vaginal
microflora intact may provide low-cost and culturally-appropriate solutions for ongoing treatment of gynecological
conditions."

An over-arching goal of the Department of Dermatology at The University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center is to produce scientific leaders in skin biology and skin disease. To sustain this goal, we
seek to renew our T32 Dermatology Research Training Program, which primarily recruits MD/PhD or
MD candidates from dermatology residency applicants as early as the residency match. The program’s
success can be measured by our graduates’ achievements in acquiring federal grants as principal
investigators (over 60% of graduates to date) and leadership positions in academia and industry. These
accomplishments validate current policies: (1) selecting candidates with proven scientific achievements
and strong potential for independent investigation; (2) continuing a physician-scientist track that trains 2
yrs. in clinical dermatology and then 2 yrs. in research (historically fundamental and/or translational, but
with recent expansion into clinical); and (3) preceptorship under outstanding faculty from our Graduate
School of Biosciences. The program will continue to be administered: by the same director and 2 co-
directors (a senior one and a junior one who is a program alumnus) plus a new (internationally
renowned) PhD scientist, by a coordinator, and by 3 advisors who hold Dean-ship positions at
Southwestern. We gathered 38 potential preceptors (including a Nobel laureate and 9 members of the
National Academy of Science), all of whom have received NIH R01 grants and are effective mentors
and meaningful interactors with dermatology personnel. In the aggregate, our preceptors’ publications
rate a high mean H-index of 64. For the next funding cycle, we have already recruited 6 outstanding
post-doc trainees. The program was given exceptional reviews by Dennis Roop PhD in 2018 and by
Alice Pentland MD in 2019, with Dr. Pentland judging the program in the context of comments from the
Study Section."

The objective of “Brain Computer Interfaces and Disability: Developing an Inclusive Ethical Framework (BCI-
DEF)” is to use structured vignettes, video-supported interviews, and a deliberative democracy approach to
assess and analyze diverse, critical stakeholder perspectives about the benefits, risks, and ethical challenges
of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology. BCIs measure and interpret brain signals and interface with a
device to allow users to perform a task, such as communication or movement. BCIs hold great promise,
especially for end users with disability due to neurologic deficits in communication or motor function, but this
potential may be limited by unaddressed ethical challenges. Issues of concern include stigma, autonomy,
privacy, safety, impacts to personhood, responsibility and justice. Through the innovative approach in this
project, we will focus on input from a primary group of potential end users (patients with neurologic disability
and their family/caregivers) and clinicians who care for patients with acute neurologic injury to obtain critical
and heretofore absent information about important focus areas related to ethics of BCI. The inclusion of
additional key stakeholders including BCI engineers and research teams will further inform the deliberative
democracy approach. Issues we will further investigate through this project include weighing the potential
benefits and risks of BCI; evaluating ethical challenges surrounding BCI and disability including those around
autonomy, stigma, and justice; impact of BCI on perceptions of disability and clinical decision making in acute
brain injury; and defining critical information needed by end users, families, and clinicians to make future
informed decisions about BCI use. This work is critical to ensure seamless, equitable, and ethical adaptation of
innovative and cutting edge BCI technologies being developed through BRAIN Initiative projects."

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory posits that early life environment predicts
adverse health effects that may not manifest for decades. Adolescence is an understudied life stage
characterized by profound brain remodeling and behavioral development, which may be influenced by the early
life environment. We hypothesize that exposure to neuroactive (i.e., neurotoxic and neuroprotective) metals
during the early postnatal period (0-2 years) impacts the trajectory of brain and executive function
development, particularly in attention and working memory. The study of trajectories necessitates assessment
of phenotypic development over time, rather than at a single time point as is most common in environmental
health research. We propose studying longitudinal brain structure/function and executive function (EF)
trajectories using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized EF tasks in an
accelerated longitudinal design (ALD). An ALD is a commonly used epidemiologic tool that shortens the time
needed to assess neurodevelopmental trajectories compared to a traditional longitudinal cohort design. We do
so by leveraging the PHIME (Public Health Impact of Metals Exposure) study, a cohort of adolescents in
Northern Italy. One third of the PHIME community lives proximal to a steel producing plant that emits
neuroactive metals, supporting our ability to study the role of mixed metal exposures on health. Previously
we have shown cross-sectional associations between manganese (Mn), one of the more common plant
emissions, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. More recently, we employed a novel, validated tooth
biomarker to reconstruct prenatal and early childhood Mn exposures in naturally shed baby teeth, allowing us
to show the prospective effects of early life Mn exposure on adolescent neurodevelopment measured at one
time point. In this renewal, we extend our tooth biomarker to reconstruct past exposure to a mixture of
common metals (Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr) and link specific exposure life stages [i.e., fetal life [(14 weeks
gestation through birth), early postnatal life (0-2 years) and childhood (2-6 years)] to trajectories of
structural/functional brain development and neurobehavior throughout adolescence. To complement the tooth
biomarker, we will enroll new cohort members to assess phenotype trajectories from age 7-25 years (i.e. the
onset through conclusion of adolescence). This renewal builds prior cross-sectional and prospective findings
by creating a life course study of adolescent developmental trajectories of brain structure/function and EF. All
told, our life course study covers 25 years in a single grant cycle and will be a model for future studies of early
life environment and adolescent health, an understudied life stage representing the transition into adulthood. In
sum, this renewal within PHIME will determine the critical exposure windows for early life metal exposure on
adolescent developmental trajectories, a key research need so that interventions may be applied at the
appropriate age to promote optimal development and improved health."

After carbon and hydrogen; oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine are the three most common elements found in
pharmaceuticals and drug candidates. Lead identification and optimization is typically the longest part of the drug
discovery process, taking about five out of the average fifteen years, to bring a drug to market. This is partially
due to the requirement to synthesize and test of a large number of potential drug candidates through structure
activity relationship (SAR) studies. As such, the development of new organic methodologies for the rapid
synthesis of organic molecules is of utmost importance to synthetic chemists. The research described herein
focuses on the development of novel approaches for the synthesis of C–N, C–O, C–S, C–P, C–F, C–Cl, C–Br,
and C–B bonds, in a selective and expedient manner. Moreover, it seeks to allow for divergent synthesis; where
from a single common intermediate libraries of potential pharmaceuticals could be synthesized in a single
synthetic transformation simply by varying the reagents. More specifically, the proposal focuses on the
development of an array of carbon-carbon double bond difunctionalization of using a copper or palladium
catalyst."

Mitochondria are centers of metabolism and signaling, and their functions are essential for all but a few eukaryotic
cell types. Despite the widespread importance of these organelles, many aspects of mitochondrial biology remain
remarkably obscure. This fact contributes to our poor ability to diagnose mitochondrial diseases and our near
complete inability to rectify mitochondrial dysfunction therapeutically. This dysfunction is associated with ~350
rare inborn errors of metabolism and an increasing number of common diseases—including Parkinson’s,
Alzheimer’s, various cancers, and type 2 diabetes—often through distinct, yet unclear means. A major bottleneck
to further understanding mitochondrial processes and addressing their dysfunction in human disease is that the
proteins driving them have often not been identified. Concurrently, the basic biochemical functions of many
mitochondrial proteins that may fulfill these roles are undefined, or at best are poorly understood. This reality
was made manifest by my efforts to generate MitoCarta, which doubled the number of known mammalian
mitochondrial proteins and revealed a striking ~300 lacking any annotated function. Thus, an overarching goal
of my research program is to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial biology by
systematically establishing the functions of orphan mitochondrial proteins and their roles within disease-related
processes. We do so by first devising novel, multi-dimensional analyses designed to make new connections
between these proteins and established pathways and processes. These include customized, multiomic
analyses of yeast and human cell gene knockouts, deep mutational scanning approaches, large-scale genetic
screens, and other mass spectrometry-based investigations. We then employ mechanistic and structural
approaches to define the functions of select proteins at biochemical depth, and chemical biology approaches to
design small molecules to manipulate their functions in vitro and in vivo. This strategy leads us into diverse and
unanticipated new directions; however, we also maintain a persistent focus on the biochemistry, biosynthesis,
and transport of coenzyme Q (CoQ). We are driven to define how this remarkable, redox-active, extremely
hydrophobic molecule is produced in mitochondria, distributed throughout the cell, and how its cofactor and
antioxidant functions empower an ever-growing list of diverse biochemical processes. Overall, these “systems
biochemistry” efforts promise to help establish a deep, mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial biochemistry
that will motivate novel therapeutic strategies for the vast array of human disorders rooted in mitochondrial
dysfunction."

Biomolecular condensates are compartments that form within cells through the self-assembly of proteins, RNAs,
etc. These condensates play a critical role in the functioning of cells as they help to concentrate biomolecules
and facilitate biochemical reactions. Recent studies have shown that they are also essential for transcriptional
regulation. However, there are still many unanswered questions about how these condensates form, interact
with each other, and how they organize chromatin and regulate transcription. One of the challenges in addressing
these questions is the lack of suitable experimental techniques for quantitatively studying the spatiotemporal
complexity and heterogeneity of transcriptional condensates. We propose to characterize transcriptional
condensates in the context of chromatin using in silico approaches. (i) By introducing many-body potentials
represented using graph neural networks and novel parameterization schemes, we will introduce the next
generation of residue-level coarse-grained (CG) models for proteins, RNAs, and DNAs. These models will
outperform existing ones that often lack the accuracy needed for de novo predictions, enabling their application
from generating testable hypotheses. (ii) Using CG models that balance computational efficiency and chemical
accuracy, we will reconstruct in vivo chromatin organization at near-atomistic resolution with a multiscale
approach. We will evaluate the stability of these near-atomistic models and the contribution of physicochemical
interactions in stabilizing chromatin. In addition, we will quantify the role of transcriptional condensates in
chromatin looping and accelerating transcription factor target search using reconstructed in vivo chromatin
structures. (iii) We will also decode the molecular grammar of protein-protein interactions that dictate condensate
stability using evolutionary sequence analysis and physical simulations. We will use this information to design
small molecules for condensate modulation. Overall, the goal of our research is to provide critical evaluations of
hypotheses on the role of transient, collective phenomena arising from weak, multivalent interactions in essential
cellular processes and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for their modulation."
10842907,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Aging has long been known to be a risk factor for the development of postoperative neurocognitive disorder
(poNCD), but the mechanisms underlying this observation are largely obscure. Approximately 10% of patients
> 60 years of age undergoing surgery and anesthesia develop poNCD, which can be present for several months.
Work by others indicates that in young adult mice several general anesthetics lead to a redistribution of 5-
containing GABAA receptors (5-GABAARs) into cell surface membranes, which is associated with an
impairment of cognitive function. It has been shown in mice that negative allosteric modulation of 5-GABAARs
blocks the sustained memory-impairing effects of general anesthetics. This is the current “dogma” in the field.
Our hypothesis is, however, that an age-related functional reduction of the 5-GABAA receptor system at least
in part underlies declining cognitive functions with aging. In support of this hypothesis, we have demonstrated
that in aged mice (>18 months of age) both increasing the availability of 5-GABAARs (with chronic intermittent
propofol) and positive allosteric modulation of 5-GABAARs (with MP-III-022) result in cognitive improvements
and an essentially complete block of surgery-induced memory impairments. We now propose to study molecular
and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline including the mechanisms by which increased
activity of 5-GABAARs can attenuate surgery-induced inflammation. We plan to examine the exact timing of
the effects of such an increased functional activity of the 5-GABAARs on blocking the development of
postoperative cognitive deficits to examine differential contributions of a reduction of microglial activation and of
a normalization of an 5 “deficit” with aging. Transcriptomic studies will reveal whether increased availabiliy of
5-GABAARs on cell surface membranes or positive allosteric modulation of 5-GABAARs reverse at least some
of the aging-related changes in gene expression and mitochondrial function. We then want to clarify the role of
a specific GABAA receptor subtype on astroytes and of astrocytes in general on the distrubution of 5-GABAARs
in cellular membranes, in part using calcium imaging in vivo. Finally, we want to identify cellular targets
underlying the prevention or reversal of postoperative cognitive deficits in aged mice. In mice conditionally
lacking 5-GABAARs in different principal neurons and interneuronal cell types and on microglia cells we expect
to see a contribution of 5-GABAARs on multiple cell types to the attenuation of postoperative cognitive deficits.
The involvement of the hippocampus in this process will be assessed by monitoring place cell formation and
stability of the memory engram by calcium imaging in vivo. The proposed studies are envisioned to have a
positive translational impact, providing a pathway for testing the positive modulation of 5-GABAARs in elderly
patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia. Positive allosteric modulators of 5-GABAARs are currently being
developed by others, and once such compounds become available for experimental use in humans, our
proposed studies provide a fundamental science framework supporting clinical studies for poNCD."

Our laboratory is interested in studying artificial assembly of natural products with promising biological activities
and developing new reactions. Securing short, scalable, and flexible synthetic routes tests the limitations of
chemical methods and provides access to unnatural analogs that would otherwise be beyond the reach. This
approach often necessitates development of new transformations and synthetic strategies that streamline the
assembly of the desired scaffolds. Therefore, vertical advancements in the fields of chemistry and related areas
of biology can be anticipated.
 Over the past several years, we succeeded in developing new synthetic routes to several families of natural
products, including indoloterpenoids, anthraquinone-xanthone heterodimers, labdane diterpenes, quassinoids,
and mutilins. We demonstrated a new radical-polar crossover polycyclization that allowed for concise assembly
of the tricyclic core found in indoloterpenoids and led to the synthesis of emindole SB, the simplest member of
the family. As a corollary to these studies, we also developed a catalytic intermolecular formal ene reaction
between ketone-derived silyl enol ethers and alkynes, which exhibited high selectivity for generation of
quaternary centers. We subsequently completed the synthesis of nodulisporic acid C, a potent parasiticidal
agent, where we employed a diverse set of tactics to assemble disparate polycyclic motifs and a sensitive indole
moiety. In a continuation of these studies, we developed a powerful annulation reaction, which allowed for direct
assembly of complex terpenoid motifs and led to the synthesis of forskolin, a densely functionalized labdane
diterpenoid. Further studies of the annulation spanned a broader range of polycyclic scaffolds and ultimately
resulted in short syntheses of quassin and pleuoromutilin. In another effort, we developed a short synthesis of
acremoxanthone A, an anthraquinone-xanthone heterodimer with antibacterial activity. Driven by these
investigations, we also developed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-initiated semipinacol rearrangements of tertiary
allylic alcohols where the outcome of the reaction was under strong catalyst control. Based on our findings, we
proposed that these transformations involve catalysis by alkylcobalt complexes and developed the first
asymmetric HAT-initiated hydrofunctionalization, which allowed for cyclization of dialkyl(vinyl)carbinols to the
corresponding enantioenriched epoxides.
 A significant component of our future efforts will focus on identification of new ways to control reactivity in HAT-
initiated process, which remains a significant challenge. These studies will capitalize on our previous discoveries
to uncover new transformations for assembly of complex structural motifs and will also employ natural product
synthesis as a way to interrogate the limitations of our methods. Overall, new chemical reactions and new
synthetic strategies are expected to result."

Long-read sequencing in the form of Paciﬁc Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)
have upended the preconceived notion of the capabilities of DNA sequencing applications. However, the
molecular biology and computational methods available for long-read sequencing still lag behind the rich
ecosystem of methods available for short- read technology in terms of both capability and usability. Because of
this, the potential of long-read sequencing methods to beneﬁt biomedical research remains largely unrealized.
To address this shortfall, my lab will continue our work on developing and using methods that push the
capabilities of long-read sequencing technology. First, we will generate complete isoform-level tissue and cell-
type transcriptomes for human and mouse which will be invaluable to the biomedical research community
investigating gene and isoform expression using RNA-seq. In addition, access to these transcriptomes will
strongly beneﬁt assays that rely on prior knowledge of which isoforms are expressed at what level in any
particular cell-type or tissue. Second, we will develop an easy-to-use, ultra-accurate, and read-length agnostic
sequencing method which will democratize the use of high-throughput sequencing technology and thereby
increase the diversity of the genomics workforce by enabling a much larger number of less well funded labs to
perform high-quality high-throughput DNA sequencing assays."

 The highest HIV incidence in South Africa is among young women, many of whom are in relationships with
a primary partner in which alcohol and other drug (AOD) use is common between them, in addition to
condomless sex, outside sex partners, and gender-based violence (GBV). Many young women and their
partners are in young adulthood, a critical period characterized by sexual risk. The proposed revised
comprehensive prevention and treatment approach is needed to address these intersectional epidemics. We
propose to modify our evidence-based couples' intervention for young couples in Cape Town.
 The proposed Couples' Health CoOp Plus (CHC+) biobehavioral intervention will include information about
and linkage to PrEP and ART. We also will refine a stigma-reduction training for clinics to address
stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors toward young people who use AODs and seek HIV services. We
propose a multilevel approach through a cluster randomized trial with a modified factorial design whereby 24
clinics are randomized to receive either stigma-reduction training or no training. From the clinic catchment
areas in economically disadvantaged communities, we will use NIDA's Seek, Test, Treat and Retain
paradigm to seek 480 couples (aged 18 to 30). Clinics in catchment areas will be randomized to receive HIV
testing services (HTS) and/or the CHC+. An earlier study demonstrated the efficacy of the couples'
intervention on AOD use, sex risk, gender roles and HIV incidence, but it did not incorporate ART and PrEP
(treat); nor was it integrated into clinics to address stigma in service provision (treat and retain).
The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To modify the CHC intervention to include ART/PrEP in a formative phase
and with review from our Community Collaborative Board and a Peer Advisory Board. Aim 2. To evaluate
the impact of a stigma-reduction training on clinic staffs' attitudes and behaviors toward young women and
their primary male partner seeking HIV services (testing/ART/PrEP) and other sexual and reproductive
health services with clinic staff at 6 and 12 months. Aim 3. To test the efficacy of the CHC+ to increase both
partners' PrEP/ART initiation and adherence (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), and reduce AOD use, sexual risk
and GBV, and enhance positive gender norms and communication relative to HTS (at 6 and 12 months).
Aim 4. To examine through mixed methods the interaction of the stigma-reduction training and the CHC+ on
increased PrEP and ART initiation, retention, and adherence among young women and their primary
partners.
 If this multilevel approach demonstrates efficacy in increasing PrEP and ART initiation, adherence and
retention, it could help achieve the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) goals. If successful, the project
could help the governments of South Africa and the United States identify new approaches to expanding the
HIV continuum of prevention and care among young couples at risk for HIV."
10849686,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Delivering goal-concordant care is considered a key component of high-value care for seriously ill older
adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC); however, no gold standard for measurement exists. The long-
term goal of the proposed work is to advance the science of quality measurement among seriously ill older
adults with palliative care needs. The overall objective in this application is to develop a psychometrically valid
patient-reported experience measure (PREM) that measures goal-concordant care among seriously ill older
adults with MCC. The rationale is that a validated PREM measuring goal-concordant care can provide real-
time feedback necessary to deliver patient-centered care that meets the dynamic needs of this population,
while simultaneously functioning as a quality indicator for palliative care delivery. The proposed work will
complete the overall objective through three specific aims: 1) develop an item pool that measures goal-
concordant care based on domains of health-related values among seriously ill older adults with MCC; 2)
evaluate measurement properties of the item pool and resultant PREM by conducting Item Response Theory
analysis and test-retest reliability of field test data; and 3) determine the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of
PREM implementation in primary care. The first aim establishes the PREM’s content validity and is a
multimethod qualitative study consisting of: 1) semi-structured interviews with seriously ill older adults with
MCC and their PCPs and 2) content analysis of serious illness conversation documentation in the electronic
health record identified using natural language processing. Themes that emerge from this qualitative process
will inform item and scale generation and refine the hierarchy of health-related value domains relevant to goal-
concordant care. Items will be further developed and refined via focus groups with patients and geriatric
palliative care experts to identify relevant content not already covered; cognitive interviews with patients to
format the items; and item review by the study team. The second aim will establish the PREM’s reliability and
construct validity and consists of field tests of seriously ill older adults with MCC followed by psychometric
analyses to develop and evaluate the items comprising the PREM. Under the third aim, 40 seriously ill older
adults with MCC will complete the PREM in a primary care clinic over 48 weeks in a single-arm pilot study with
a multistage, mixed methods design to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of PREM
implementation. This proposal is innovative because it will develop the first validated PREM that measures
goal-concordant care among seriously ill older adults with MCC that can also be used to measure the
effectiveness of advanced care planning. This work is highly significant because this PREM transforms goal-
concordant care into a measurable and actionable construct by quantifying the patient’s experience of how
effectively care processes support the patient’s ability to attain self-concordant goals. Ultimately, this PREM
will help establish a quality standard for palliative care delivery for seriously ill older adults with MCC."
10849885,"Excitotoxicity is defined as the deterioration of neuronal function/structure caused by excessive glutamatergic
stimulation. It is a shared major pathological hallmark in many neurodegenerative diseases (ND), including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Excitotoxicity is
mostly mediated by the activation of the NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs). However, the NMDAR
function is indispensable for normal neuronal function. This conundrum is explained by the fact that NMDARs
are segregated in two populations: synaptic (sNMDARs) and extrasynaptic (exNMDARs). While sNMDARs are
linked to pro-survival signaling, over-activation of exNMDARs triggers excitotoxicity. Therefore, exNMDAR are
obvious pharmacological targets in a broad range of ND and, in fact, blocking NMDAR activity strongly
ameliorates cognitive defects in AD and HD mouse models. However, selective inhibition of exNMDARs is
challenging, and the vast majority of NMDAR antagonists have failed in clinic due to side effects mediated by
sNMDAR blockade. We propose to test a novel therapeutic strategy based on the fact that s- and exNMDARs
are not independent populations. On the contrary, s- and exNMDARs pools are physiologically connected via
lateral diffusion. We hypothesize that shifting the s/exNMDAR balance towards synaptic expression would be
beneficial two-folds (i) promoting survival cascades (sNMDAR-mediated) and (ii) decreasing pro-death signaling
(exNMDAR-mediated). We are ideally suited to test this strategy because we have previously identified several
of the mechanisms controlling s/exNMDAR balance. Those include different protein interactions with the
GluN2B-subunit of NMDARs and a particular phosphorylation on GluN2B (at S1480) that promotes sNMDAR
clearance and receptor stabilization at extrasynaptic sites. The goal of this proposal is to validate the proof-of-principle that reducing excitotoxicity by preventing sNMDAR clearance and/or promoting exNMDAR reinsertion
into synaptic sites is an effective therapeutic strategy in ND. In Aim 1, we will evaluate novel molecular tools to
modulate s/exNMDAR balance in culture and in vivo, including (i) small interfering peptides (sIPs) and (ii)
pharmacology to modulate GluN2B phosphorylation. Our study includes the repurposing of an anti-tumoral drug
currently in phase 1/2 of clinical trial. Also, we will use proteomics to compare the posttranslational modification
profile of s- vs. exNMDARs, aiming to identify novel mechanisms regulating the balance. In Aim 2, we will
evaluate the suitability of this strategy as a common therapeutic strategy in ND. First, we will test the efficacy of
our tools in ameliorating excitotoxicity-mediated pathological outcomes in several models of AD, both in culture
and in vivo. Finally, we will use our strategy in primary cultures from models of HD (associated by excitotoxicity)
and Parkinson’s disease (excitotoxicity is not a primary pathomechanism). If successful, this proposal, based on
reducing excitotoxicity by regulating NMDAR trafficking but not by inhibiting NMDAR function, will have a
groundbreaking translational impact on the identification of innovative therapeutics for a wide range of ND."

has recently uncovered a novel mechanism of cargo transport in the Apicomplexan protozoan parasite
Toxoplasma gondii; elucidating the mechanistic details underlying this intracellular transport system is the focus
on this proposal. T. gondii is part of the phylum Apicomplexan, which contains a large number of medically
important parasites including Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria and Cryptosporidium spp. that
can cause life-threatening diarrheal disease. Thus, in addition to providing insight into the diverse mechanisms
of cargo transport that exist in evolutionary divergent eukaryotes, understanding the molecular basis of cargo
transport in Apicomplexa could lead to the identification of potential targets of anti-parasitic drug development.
Our previously published and preliminary data demonstrate that two cytoskeletal proteins, actin and an
unconventional myosin (MyoF) are required for the movement of a wide range of intracellular cargo. Although
MyoF has structural similarity to the well-characterized cargo transporter myosin V, we demonstrate that MyoF
does not associate directly with its membrane bound cargo. Instead, MyoF is an organizer of the underlying actin
cytoskeleton. In order to gain a complete picture of this cargo transport mechanism, our goal is to identify
additional molecular players that are required for cargo transport and to define the mechanisms by which these
proteins drive cargo movement in collaboration with MyoF and actin. Specifically, we will answer the following
outstanding questions: How is the activity of MyoF regulated? How does vesicular cargo associate with the actin
cytoskeleton? Are there additional proteins that cooperate with MyoF to control the organization and dynamics
of the actin cytoskeleton? To address these questions, we will utilize three distinct, yet complementary,
experimental approaches: (1) parasite genetics and cell biology, (2) live cell imaging and quantitative vesicle
tracking and (3) in vitro biophysical approaches. My laboratory occupies a unique niche at the intersection
between parasitology and molecular motors fields. Utilizing these interdisciplinary approaches makes us ideally
positioned to provide new insights into this understudied process."

operations, expand its capabilities, and ensure its sustainability as the primary resource for the preservation
and distribution of genetically defined strains of Tetrahymena. Investigations aimed at understanding
Tetrahymena biology have contributed many novel and important findings on cellular mechanisms that have
direct relevance to human health and disease including cancer, infertility, and aging. Tetrahymena has also
shown great promise as a platform for the production of recombinant proteins, including vaccine antigens and
difficult-to-express human ion channels. Furthermore, it serves as an engaging teaching tool in K-12 and
undergraduate classrooms. Specifically, our overall aims for the resource are to 1) continue to act as a strain
repository accepting new strains and making cultures of Tetrahymena available to scientists and science
educators at reasonable cost; 2) expand the resource by integrating additional large collections; 3) increase
the visibility of Stock Center resources and increase publication of research findings by partnering with
microPublications Biology; 4) curate new genomic information into the Tetrahymena Genome Database; 5)
improve curation of stocks by assigning RRID designations to new acquisitions and use bioinformatics to link
genes associated with specific stocks to human disease-associated genes; 6) increase the interoperability of
genomic data by updating the current gene annotations and expanding the use of Gene Ontology
designations; 7) facilitate new analyses by displaying gene expression data sets; 8) improve the Stock Center
website and increase its capacity to gather assessment data; 9) use genomic data to identify the genetic
lesions of strains in the repository with striking phenotypes thereby spurring additional research; 10) optimize
gene knockout strategies to allow for timely completion of Tetrahymena strain engineering services offered by
the Stock Center. Together, these activities aim to keep Tetrahymena at the forefront of biomedical research
and achieve the Overall outcome of increasing research capacity of investigators using ciliates to make
significant discoveries."
10852316,"Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the third leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and 32.6 million adults
have AUD. AUD etiology is highly diverse and current treatment strategies for AUD have high rates of relapse
(40 to 60%). Therefore, identifying novel factors facilitating development of AUD is critical, and expansion of
the `tool-box' beyond current behavioral and pharmacological targets is required for development of novel
effective treatments. A critical gap that hampers discovery of novel AUD treatment is the lack of studies
examining the interaction of the brain and body during various stages of the disease. The vagus nerve is the
main conductor of brain-body signals and previous clinical and preclinical evidence, as well as our preliminary
data, suggest dysfunction of vagus nerve activity is a driver of AUD development and relapse risk.
Furthermore, our preliminary data shows that a selective gastric vagotomy (VX) results in increased alcohol
intake and preference in rodent models and is associated with alterations in paraventricular (PVN)
hypothalamic neurocircuits. Therefore, we propose to use a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological,
molecular, histological and viral transgenic techniques to test the novel hypothesis that disruptions of the
gastric vagus nerve activity may increase alcohol preference via selective down-regulation of PVN oxytocin
function. As a corollary to this, we will investigate whether targeting PVN oxytocin neurons may rescue VX-
induced increases in alcohol preference. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that VX will increase alcohol
reward (preference and seeking) and alters PVN gene expression. Specific Aim 2 then will test the hypothesis
that activation of PVN oxytocin neurons will rescue increased alcohol preference following VX. Identifying
specific brain targets and mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of healthy vagal activity to reduce
alcohol preference, thus reducing motivation for alcohol consumption, could further aid development of both
novel pharmacological and non-pharmacologic AUD interventions."
10862750,"Project Summary: Dementia has a high global prevalence due to the aging population and places an
enormous burden on health care systems. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of
dementia, and it is widely believed that the accumulation of Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is a key event in the
pathogenesis of AD, representing preclinical disease stages. Cerebral iron is also strongly implicated as a
cofactor in the pathogenesis of AD, and its overload accelerates Aβ production and promotes the toxicity of
the Aβ peptide. However, the impact of brain iron load, and its combined effect with regional Aβ-plaque-load
on cognitive impairment in AD and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is lacking. Our overall aim
is to study the role of brain iron load and its possible synergistic effect with Aβ-plaque-load in the
development of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, in particular AD. We will perform such study using data
from two prospective cohort studies: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, which has
collected clinical data from cohort participants over the past 30 years and the UK biobank study, which
collects extensive clinical, imaging and genetic data in the UK adult population. In the ARIC study, a biracial
sample of elderly adults was evaluated by brain MRI, florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET), and
cognitive tests at study visit 5 with repeat testing underway at visit 6. We will utilize the phase signal from
gradient echo MRI data at visit 6 (n=1,000) to compute quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Brain iron
load will be automatically quantified using our recent developed susceptibility multi-atlas tool. We will then
for Aim 1 determine if increased cerebral iron measures are independently associated with cognitive
performance with the presence of MCI or dementia in these ARIC participants aged 73-94 years. We will
also assess possible associations between known midlife vascular risk factors with cerebral iron as
measured in late-life. For Aim 2, we will estimate the combined effects of Aβ-plaque-load as measured by
florbetapir PET in the ARIC-PET study (n=300) and increased cerebral iron-load as measured by QSM on
the progression of cognitive impairment with adjustment for contributions from demographic, contemporary
vascular risk factors, small vessel diseases and APOE-e4 status. To further establish the causality between
brain iron and cognitive function in Aim 3, we will perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with
Mendelian randomization to find genetic determinants of cerebral iron and their association with cognitive
function. Cerebral iron as measured by QSM will be calculated from UK biobank brain MRI data
(n~=35,000), while genetic variants associated with cerebral iron load will tested against the cognitive
function measures in the remaining ~465,000 independent samples."
10862754,"Project summary
Steroid receptors are a subset of nuclear receptor (NR) transcription factors that are found only in vertebrates
and regulate essential functions such as organismal development and reproduction, while also impacting aging,
tumorigenesis, and cancer progression. Small lipophilic hormones bind to steroid receptors for estrogens (ER-
alpha and ER-beta), progesterone (PR), glucocorticoids (GR), and androgens (AR) and transmit their signal
through gene regulation. Since these small molecules can be synthetically modified and manufactured, a variety
of pharmaceutical drugs provide critical medicines for diseases including metabolic disorders, reproduction, and
cancer treatment. NR mechanism of action has been mostly studied at RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed
genes including protein-coding mRNAs and small/long non-coding RNAs. Multiple NRs act in complexes on DNA
to activate or repress Pol II transcription. However, NR controlled cell transcriptomes are often not always tightly
correlated with the proteome due to post-transcriptional regulation that is not completely understood. We have
uncovered a second layer of coordinated NR activity through regulation of RNA Polymerase III (Pol III)
transcribed genes. Pol III transcribes small RNAs essential for translation of mRNAs into protein including tRNAs
and 5S rRNA and is a major node for controlling cell growth, stem cells, aging, and cancer. Negative regulation
of Pol III is commonly through the conserved repressor Maf1. Very little is known concerning how NRs regulate
Pol III in more complex mammalian cells and organisms. We discovered using genome-wide analyses of PR
chromatin binding in ER+PR+ breast cancer cell lines and tumors that PR localizes at multiple tRNA genes. PR
associates with the Pol III complex and decreases tRNA levels and protein synthesis. Progesterone recruits PR
and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) to tRNA genes near a conserved DNA sequence resembling an NR
binding half site. Our hypothesis is that PR regulates Pol III transcription of tRNA genes through crosstalk with
RARα and recruitment of Maf1 resulting in decreased levels of target tRNA genes and selective translation. Aim
1 will determine how PR associates at tRNA genes, the role of RARα and other steroid receptors, and the NR
binding half site. Aim 2 will determine the role of Maf1 in PR modulation of Pol III transcription. Aim 3 will define
hormone-induced changes in the tRNA pool and the impact on translational efficiency. Regulation of Pol III is
vastly understudied compared to Pol II and crucial for normal and oncogenic cell phenotypes. Results of this
study will define a novel mechanism of NR action at Pol III genes that will help explain i) an additional layer of
hormone regulation that contributes to selective mRNA translation, and ii) how NRs converge on multiple cell
polymerases to impact cell growth, differentiation, stemness, and tumor progression."
10863343,"Project Summary/Abstract – Project 2: mRNA Vaccine Development against Bunyaviruses,
Paramyxoviruses and Picornaviruses
As the emergence of new pathogenic outbreaks in the future is not a matter of “if”, but of “when”, development
of prophylactic vaccines against viruses with high pandemic potential prior to actual outbreaks is a reasonable
strategy to contribute to global pandemic preparedness. The lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated nucleoside-
modified mRNA platform is particularly suitable for vaccine development against viral pathogens because it can
efficiently generate T follicular helper cell responses associated with the induction of durable and broadly
protective antibody responses. Beside potency, this novel, synthetic vaccine platform has important advantages
over other vaccine types, including rapid, scalable production that does not require complicated infrastructure
(such as mammalian cell culture and protein purification systems). Additionally, the enormous flexibility of the
mRNA-LNP platform allows the co-formulation of several antigen-encoding mRNAs into a single vaccine regimen
to elicit more potent and/or broadly protective immune responses. The overall goal of Project 2 of this U19
Program is to develop potent mRNA-based vaccines against select members of Bunyaviruses, Paramyxoviruses
and Picornaviruses, capable of inducing protective immune responses and evaluate them in animal models.
In Aim 1.1, we will design and produce nucleoside-modified mRNA immunogens targeting select members of
Bunyaviruses, Paramyxoviruses and Picornaviruses. In Aim 1.2, we will collaborate with Project 1 (Felgner Lab)
on LNP-formulation of the mRNA immunogens using various lipids. In Aim 1.3, in vitro characterization
(confirmation of protein production from each mRNA) of mRNA-LNP vaccines will be performed using HEK293T
cells. Evaluation of the immunogenicity of Bunyavirus, Paramyxovirus and Picornavirus mRNA-LNP vaccines
will be performed in Aims 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. In all 3 subaims, antibody responses (antigen-specific
IgG, virus neutralization) as well as T and B cell (T follicular helper cell, CD8+ T cell, germinal center B cell,
memory B cell and plasma cell) responses will be evaluated. The durability of antibody responses will also be
assessed. Based on the results of challenge experiments (performed by Projects 3-5), multivalent vaccines will
be generated and tested for immunogenicity and protective efficacy. If the multivalent formulations provide high
levels of protection in mice (tested by Projects 3-5), they will be evaluated in nonhuman primates by the
Translational Immunology Core.
The proposed work will yield “prototype” vaccines that can be tested in clinical trials and quickly be adjusted to
a pandemic pathogen and be produced and distributed at large scale. These deliverables have an immediate
translational potential and will significantly contribute to our pandemic preparedness against Bunyaviruses,
Paramyxoviruses and Picornaviruses with high pandemic potential."
10863344,"Project Summary/Abstract – Project 3: Peribunyaviridae Pathogenesis and Vaccine Testing
The orthobunyaviruses (OBVs) of Peribunyviridae cause disease in humans manifesting with fever, nausea,
fatigue, and viral encephalitis, as well as long-term neurological complications. Identifying receptors and immune
factors mediating infection will highlight additional avenues of therapeutic development to work in tandem with
vaccination efficacy approaches. As these viruses are increasing in prevalence and vector range, their emergent
potential is high, and there is a critical need to better understand their pathogenesis and develop safe and
effective vaccines against OBVs. As part of this U19, this project will focus on identifying additional vaccine
targets while validating protein-adjuvant and mRNA vaccines developed in Projects 1 and 2. Importantly, these
studies will define both acute and long-term correlates of protection. The long-term goals are to 1) validate
immunogenic, multi-platform vaccines for OBVs, targeting LACV, OROV, and CVV as representative viruses; 2)
delineate mechanisms of OBV pathogenesis; and 3), define the role vaccines play in preventing sequelae. This
will test the hypothesis that 1) differential cytokine expression drives early and late stage OBV disease, 2)
vaccination prevents both acute and long-term effects of infection, and 3) OBVs exploit conserved receptors for
entry into the CNS. The first aim will define host immune responses to OBV infection in vivo. To determine
early and late-stage host immune responses to OBV infection, we will assess innate and adaptive immunity in
humanized immuno-competent and -compromised mouse models after infection with LACV, OROV, or CVV.
Serum cytokine levels, regulation of immune signaling genes, and histopathology will be assessed. This will
define key immunological mechanisms of protection against OBV infection and highlight avenues for additional
therapeutic development. The second aim will assess short and long-term protection against OBV infection
with adjuvanted subunit and mRNA vaccines in vivo. Adjuvanted subunit vaccines and mRNA vaccines
targeting Gc/Gn and NP antigens will be tested for protection against short- and long-term OBV outcomes in
animal models to identify lead vaccine candidates. MRI and behavioral analyses will be applied to understand
vaccine protection against disease sequelae. The third aim will identify conserved host cell receptors for
OBV attachment and entry mediating CNS tropism. The Antibody Generation, Epitope Mapping, and Machine
Learning Core will provide computational interaction screening, after which candidates will be verified in
permissive CNS cells and mouse models. Promising receptors will be blocked with inhibitors and knocked out
by CRISPR/Cas9 with subsequent infectivity measured in mouse and brain co-culture systems. Receptor
deficient mice will also be evaluated for changes in viral replication. Mouse models of severe infection will be
treated with receptor inhibitors to characterize changes to survival, immune responses, blood brain barrier
permeability, and long-term complications of infection."
10863346,"Project Summary/Abstract – Project 5: Multi-scale development and evaluation of broadly-effective
vaccines against picornaviruses with pandemic potential
Picornaviruses are the most common causes of viral illnesses worldwide. Within the picornavirus family of
positive-strand RNA viruses, enteroviruses such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), and
enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) have the potential to produce devastating disease sequelae in humans, including
paralytic poliomyelitis, cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis, encephalitis, meningitis, and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).
Surprisingly, the only enterovirus vaccines with U.S. FDA approval are the highly successful inactivated and
attenuated vaccines against poliovirus. In addition, there are no approved antiviral drugs to successfully treat
enterovirus infections despite their considerable pandemic potential. The availability of phylogenetically-
conserved, structure-based design approaches across a large number of related enteroviruses provides a range
of new opportunities to generate a comprehensive panel of mRNA- and protein-based vaccine candidates to
combat infection by these important human pathogens. The experimental approach for this project involves the
testing of mRNA and protein/adjuvant vaccine candidates using in vitro virus culture and animal
challenge/pathogenesis models. The proposed project will also explore novel approaches to vaccine design and
construction that leverage the unique features of picornavirus biology to generate lead strategies that may prove
broadly effective. The proposal will also employ state-of-the-art murine models for evaluating vaccine efficacy
and protection from disease. This standardized series of in vivo models will provide a unique opportunity to
compare efficacy of vaccine responses across different enterovirus serotypes and species and identify the most
promising candidates for advancement to large animal models. Collectively, the breadth of experiments proposed
will create a validated workflow for developing and testing new vaccines that are designed to provide
broad protection against multiple different known pathogenic picornaviruses. Importantly, when
combined with the other cores and projects in this application, this approach is predicted to allow the
rapid development and preclinical evaluation of vaccines and nanobody therapeutics to any new
picornavirus that emerges and represents a significant public health concern."
10859479,"ABSTRACT
Dry eye disease (DED) is a major health problem. Reduced ocular surface hydration is a key pathology in
DED, which causes symptoms and can lead to ocular surface inflammation and damage. Current FDA-
approved treatments for DED include artificial tears and anti-inflammatory agents that have variable and limited
efficacy. Here we propose a novel target for treatment of DED. The target is the extracellular Ca2+-sensing
receptor (CaSR) that has well-known modulatory effects on epithelial ion transport in various tissues such as
intestine and kidney. We found prominent CaSR expression in mouse and human corneal and conjunctival
epithelial cells. CaSR activation in the ocular surface reduced CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion, confirming key
roles of CaSR ocular surface ion transport. Importantly, we found that CaSR inhibition by NPS-2143 stimulates
CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion in the ocular surface and increases tear fluid volume in mice by ~100%. Here we
will perform key translational studies for CaSR inhibitors, by testing them in clinically relevant animal and
human cell models of DED to advance them towards clinical testing (Aim 1). We will also study the roles and
mechanisms of CaSR effect in ocular surface ion transport and health (Aim 2). The proposed studies can
potentially lead to clinical testing of CaSR inhibitors for DED in the very near future. By identifying a novel
treatment, these studies can ultimately reduce DED morbidity. Lastly, by identifying roles and mechanisms of
CaSR in ocular surface, this project can also identify novel disease mechanisms for DED."

Timely and accurate diagnosis of ocular infections is critical to support early effective therapy and save vision.
Serious infections such as infectious keratitis, uveitis and endophthalmitis are leading causes of blindness
globally. These infections are caused by a wide range of pathogens, which can often present with overlapping
features and are difficult to differentiate clinically. Laboratory-based diagnosis is an important component of
clinical management to guide efficient deployment of therapies. However, because current methods employed
for pathogen detection are outdated, time-consuming and lack sensitivity, patients can be treated for prolonged
periods with combinations of empirical broad-spectrum therapies that are not tailored for an individual, may be
ineffective, cause needless ocular toxicity, and are becoming compromised by the emergence of antimicrobial
resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic tests are critically needed to help guide therapy and improve patient
outcomes. To address this critical and urgent need, we are developing novel and highly multiplexed targeted
assays for comprehensive detection of pathogens from ocular specimens with high accuracy and speed. This
innovative approach leverages the advantages of the cutting-edge NanoString technology, which enables rapid
and simultaneous detection and quantification of hundreds of different DNA or RNA molecules while maintaining
excellent sensitivity per target. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that our novel diagnostic approach can
detect the most important etiologies of sight-threatening infections in a highly multiplexed format, with high
sensitivity and specificity, and in a timely manner, reducing the time from sample to answer from days to 12
hours. With proof-of-principle established and analytical validations thoroughly performed for an initial panel able
to simultaneously detect 48 targets in a single reaction, we are now aiming to 1) further develop, expand, and
validate our panel with the goal of covering additional pathogens of relevance in keratitis with broader
geographical coverage and applicability, and 2) lay the groundwork necessary to translate this technology into
practice and facilitate its clinical implementation by performing extensive clinical validations using our existing
large biorepositories of specimens collected from patients presenting with infectious keratitis, uveitis and
endophthalmitis, and additional samples that will continue to be collected in the first years of the project. This
proposal will result in a technically novel and clinically useful diagnostic approach that will advance the diagnosis
of infections associated with great ocular morbidity globally, using an assay that can detect ~95% of the etiologies
of sight-threatening infections in only 12 hours, and with high accuracy, including difficult to culture and potentially
unculturable pathogens, making a single-reaction diagnostic test comprehensive at an unprecedented level. This
is expected to transform ocular infection treatment by supporting prompt initiation of therapy with an effective
drug at early stages of the infection, helping to save vision and promoting antimicrobial de-escalation to reduce
the overuse of empirical therapies and limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance."

Emerging and reemerging pathogenic RNA viruses represent continuous infectious disease and pandemic
threats to public health. Among the many groups of these types of pathogens are viral zoonoses within the
family Paramyxoviridae and order Bunyavirales. The Bunyavirales is composed of several viral families known
to contain several high priority human pathogens. Notably, Arenaviridae and Nairoviridae families contain
viruses which cause severe hemorrhagic diseases in humans worldwide with associated high morbidity and
mortality. A host of arenaviruses viruses, including Lassa, Machupo, Lujo, and Chapare viruses and the
nairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and are also included among the World Health Organization’s
(WHO) List of Priority Pathogens. The zoonotic henipaviruses (HNVs) including Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra
virus (HeV), in the Paramyxoviridae family are also on the WHO Priority Pathogens. These HNVs have a
uniquely broad host tropism, causing an often fatal respiratory and/or neurological disease, and are significant
biothreats to humans and livestock in Southeast Asia and Australia. All these RNA virus threats to global public
health are heightened due to the absence of approved vaccines or therapeutics. There is a clear unmet need
for countermeasures to address the threat of natural outbreaks, epidemics, or deliberate release. The
Paramyxoviridae and Bunyavirales Vaccines and Antibodies Center (PABVAX) is a well-integrated consortium
conducting a set of discovery and translational research programs composed of a Data Management Core, 3
Scientific Cores, and 5 Research Projects (RPs). The synergistic activities of Center partners will be focused on:
developing, testing, and translating, prototype subunit vaccines employing a novel adjuvanted dissolvable,
microneedle patch (MNP) vaccine platform; developing new virus and animal model tools; and developing and
testing monoclonal antibody and nanobody prototypes to foster pandemic preparedness. The level of team
experience in both vaccines and antibody countermeasure advancements among the RPs is a major strength
and advantage of this Center. The PABVAX Center’s overall objective is to elucidate key principles for vaccine
and antibody-based countermeasures in developing prototype candidates against a selection of these viruses.
In the out years of the effort, the Center will exploit these learned key principles in a “plug and play” approach
against related viruses."

Delirium -- defined as an acute change in awareness and cognition that occurs in the setting of an underlying
illness -- is a common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in adults, with
associated morbidity and mortality. This has never been studied in children, where risk factors may vary
substantially from adults. The central hypothesis of this study is that children undergoing HSCT are at
extremely high-risk for delirium during the peri-transplant period, and that delirium is linked to poor outcomes.
The objectives of this application are: to define the epidemiology of delirium, and measure its effect on
outcomes. This prospective longitudinal cohort study will prospectively establish the incidence of delirium in
1000 children in the peri-transplant period, and identify modifiable risk factors that predispose to delirium
development. This study will also define the effect of delirium on important clinical outcomes, including
neurocognitive function. These results will lead to a paradigm shift in the care delivered to children in the peri-
transplant period. This study will be executed by a research consortium of five leading pediatric oncologic
transplant centers in North America, in collaboration with the leading pediatric delirium research group in the
United States. This innovative proposal will leverage the combined experience of the pediatric delirium and
HSCT teams to expand urgently needed delirium research into a unique and unstudied population. By reducing
delirium rates, outcomes after pediatric HSCT can be optimized. This proposal is consistent with the NIH’s new
policy to ensure research ‘Inclusion Across the Lifespan’, and will further the National Cancer Institute’s
mission to advance scientific knowledge in order to help people with cancer live longer, healthier lives."

 Mitochondria are metabolic organelles that are essential not only for energy transduction, but also a range
of other functions including biosynthesis, ion and metal homeostasis, and signaling. The long-term goal of our
laboratory is to better understand how mitochondrial function can adjust cell physiology and fate. A hallmark
example of how mitochondria can be repurposed to adjust cell function is observed in macrophages, cells of the
innate immune system. Upon activation of pro-inflammatory programs, such as with the bacterial membrane
component lipopolysaccharide, rates of mitochondrial ATP production steeply collapse, as mitochondria are
reprogrammed to generate signals that amplify the innate immune response.
 However, many of the same pathways engaged in macrophages during inflammatory activation [e.g. toll-
like receptor (TLR) and interferon signaling] are also widely present in many other cell types. While this cytokine-
mediated mitochondrial reprograming may be evolutionarily beneficial for host defense, these pathways may be
damaging when engaged in non-immune cells, particularly electrically excitable cells hugely reliant on oxidative
phosphorylation. Moreover, deleterious cytokine-driven effects on mitochondrial energetics could explain why
metabolic dysfunction and low-grade inflammation are coincident in a range of chronic and age-related diseases.
 Over the next five years, we propose to thoroughly and mechanistically characterize how common
cytokine-linked pathways – such as TLR and interferon signaling – rewire mitochondria in a range of cell types.
We will define the broader transcriptional programs required for this mitochondrial remodeling using
pharmacologic and genetic mouse models. Additionally, the proposal will examine how cytokine-driven changes
in core mitochondrial processes (e.g. oxidative phosphorylation, biosynthetic pathways, retrograde signaling,
etc.) manifest in altered physiology in cells and ex vivo organoids. By purposefully and systematically defining
how cytokines reprogram mitochondrial metabolism, this interdisciplinary program promises to reveal new
insights into mitochondrial adaptations to stress as well as crosstalk between metabolism and inflammation.
Moreover, efforts to pinpoint the regulatory enzymes and pathways driving these changes can help guide novel
therapeutic approaches seeking to restore mitochondrial function in the array of diseases that are associated
with enhanced inflammation and rooted in metabolic dysfunction."
10862876,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an invasive and rapidly progressive malignancy with a five-year
overall survival of less than 9% despite long treatment course and recent therapeutic advances. Unfortunately,
currently available imaging methods do not reliably evaluate the tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment. This
further requires surgical exploration and repeated biopsies for post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) staging.
Additionally, the conventional anatomical imaging tools underrepresent the local extent of the tumor, which leads
to suboptimal tumor volume measurement for definition of the field of radiotherapy. Therefore, a non-invasive
imaging tool for precise evaluation of treatment response and tumor size measurement is of utmost need. High
degree of fibrosis, mainly collagen type I, has been recognized as the hallmark of PDAC. Tumor-associated
fibrosis further increases in response to neoadjuvant CRT and is correlated with improved outcome in patients
with PDAC. Building on this knowledge, the current proposal aims to develop an image-guided paradigm for
improving tumor delineation and monitoring treatment response in PDAC using a novel collagen I specific PET
imaging probe, 68Ga-CBP8. This project, if successful, paves the way to provide a non-invasive and more
accurate imaging tool to guide clinicians with optimized treatment planning, reduced cost of care and side effects
of repeated invasive procedures, and ultimately improved outcome. We hypothesize that 68Ga-CBP8 PET
imaging is a reliable and repeatable method that specifically targets and quantifies PDAC-associated fibrosis.
Using the dynamic 68Ga-CBP8 PET imaging and kinetic modeling, we hypothesize that imaging PDAC can be
optimized for static imaging with much shorter acquisition time. In our second aim of the grant, we hypothesize
that 68Ga-CBP8 PET imaging precisely quantifies the increased PDAC fibrosis following neoadjuvant CRT and
thereby could be used as a surrogate of treatment response. Lastly, we will explore whether 68Ga-CBP8 PET
imaging results in more precise tumor delineation by providing more accurate gross tumor volume measurement
compared to the conventional CT or MRI when correlated to the tumor size on histopathology gold standard.
This research will be performed by Dr. Shadi Abdar Esfahani, a nuclear medicine and abdominal radiologist at
Massachusetts General Hospital. She will be exceptionally mentored by Dr. Peter Caravan, a pioneer in PET/MR
molecular imaging of fibrosis, and co-mentored by Dr. Kenneth Tanabe, a pancreas surgeon and leading expert
in clinical trials and biomarker validation for pancreatic cancer. Building upon the strong clinical experience and
solid pre-clinical research on molecular imaging of cancer models, Dr. Esfahani’s goal is to become an
independent physician-scientist by developing a program for translational, quantitative PET/MR imaging of novel
cancer biomarkers with the ultimate goal of improving clinical care and outcome. This K08 award will provide her
with the training and mentorship needed to achieve independence and apply for her first R01."

The proposed R01 grant is in direct response to PAR-18-352 “Methodology and Measurement in the
Behavioral and Social Sciences (R01)”. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder
that causes impairment in multiple domains (e.g., cognition, behavior, and quality of life) and progresses
heterogeneously in time and across domains and individuals. No single biomarker provides sufficient
information to capture the underlying severity of disease across the entire spectrum. Hence, AD studies collect
data from multiple sources (e.g., clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic; multi-modal data). We propose a novel
integrative modeling framework to provide statistically-principled inference, accurate personalized prediction of
disease progression, and dynamic prediction update, based on new subject-specific data. This novel model
development is important to identify risk and protective factors for AD and target high risk individuals, as well
as to personalize the management, prognosis, and treatment selections. The overall objectives are to: (1)
develop a multivariate functional mixed model (MFMM) for the integrative modeling of the longitudinal clinical
data; (2) use such model to provide personalized prediction of future outcome trajectories and risks of target
events; (3) advance the integrative model by incorporating the high-dimensional neuroimaging and genetic
data; (4) make this methodology easily accessible via professional software development and web
deployment. Our methods can be broadly applied to other clinical studies with similar multi-modal data

10846743,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) refers to selective expansion of blood cells derived from
a single hematopoietic stem cell due to acquired somatic mutations. CHIP is associated with increased risk of
hematologic cancer, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Currently, there is limited
understanding of the factors that cause CHIP and its progression. There are also no guidelines for monitoring or
treatment of individuals with CHIP to mitigate their risk of leukemia or CVD.
In this proposal, we seek to understand the factors associated with CHIP. For example, we do not know if race,
area of residence, socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol,
diet, exercise or stress have any impact on CHIP. We will address these questions in a large prospective study,
REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), which enrolled 30,239

≥45 years
(44% blacks, ~50% females, and 56% participants living in the southeast United States). We will use a sensitive
targeted sequencing technique that will have the ability to detect CHIP mutations present at a low frequency
compared to whole exome sequencing used in majority of the previous studies. The central goal of this proposal
is to study factors associated with CHIP in a random sample of 2,500 participants without baseline CVD to
identify individuals at high risk for CHIP. Extensive sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical data; as well as
inflammation, CVD and coagulation biomarkers are available for a subset of these participants, and will serve as
a rich resource to accomplish the aims of the study. Blacks have a higher risk of several CHIP associated
outcomes such as low blood counts, CVD and mortality. This risk is not completely explained by
sociodemographics or cardiovascular risk factors, and, we will explore the role of CHIP in racial differences of
these outcomes. The career development plan includes training in biostatistics and research methodology,
bioinformatics analysis, risk prediction modeling and health disparities research. These scientific and training
plans are supported by a team of experienced mentors and advisors who are committed to the success of this
project and my development as a physician scientist.
This proposal will strengthen my skills as a translational researcher, establish an independent research platform,
and make a true contribution towards improving our understanding of CHIP and associated outcomes. The
results from this study will be utilized as a foundation for future studies assessing factors associated with clonal
evolution (acquisition of new CHIP mutations or increase in clone size over time) and associated adverse
outcomes, and ultimately inform the management of individuals with CHIP. My proposed research experience
coupled with career development plan, mentorship and excellent institutional support will provide me with the
resources to develop an independent research career in hematology and CVD."

This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with
the goal of supporting Dr. Malinsky’s career as a quantitative researcher at the intersection of biostatistics,
epidemiology, and data science for environmental health. The training and research plan build on Dr.
Malinsky’s quantitative interdisciplinary background in statistics and computer science, in particular his
expertise in causal inference and machine learning. The overarching research goal is to develop novel
statistical methods for causal inference that meet important analytical challenges in observational
environmental epidemiology and apply these methods to the study of air pollution and chronic lung diseases,
using data from the longstanding Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). The methods will be used to
estimate the effects of several ambient air pollutants (ozone, fine particulate matter, and oxides of nitrogen) on
progression of emphysema and decline in lung function over an extended time period. Rigorously investigating
these relationships is important both for advancing our understanding of the etiology and mechanisms
underlying lung disease and to inform regulatory policies concerning pollution concentration levels. The focus
will be on extending and adapting methods for causal inference from observational longitudinal data, which
have been previously developed to accommodate time-varying confounding and quantify uncertainty due to
unmeasured confounding, but never applied to complex longitudinal data on air pollution and chronic lung
disease. These will be used to estimate the long-term lung disease consequences of hypothetical changes to
air pollution exposure levels. Aim 1 of the research plan extends existing methods to address challenges
specific to air pollution epidemiology, namely by exploiting advances in machine learning to estimate robust
exposure propensities and flexible dose-response functions. Aim 2 of the research plan leverages these
methods to investigate hypotheses about the relationships between the aforementioned pollutants and
measures of lung disease in the MESA data and identify vulnerable subpopulations. Aim 3 will extend an
approach to counterfactual sensitivity analysis in the statistical literature that quantifies uncertainty due to
unmeasured confounding to the setting of MESA and apply this approach to the MESA data. The application
delineates plans for mentoring and career development via supervision and didactic instruction in the areas of
air pollution science, environmental epidemiology, climate, longitudinal study design, and other topics relevant
to the construction of credible analysis models for the MESA data. Dr. Malinsky will be supported by a
mentoring team with considerable expertise in air pollution science & measurement, lung disease, biostatistical
methods, and environmental determinants of health. The award will establish Dr. Malinsky as an independent
investigator in this interdisciplinary area and enable him to successfully compete for R01 funding."
10839978,"Conductive hearing loss affects all ages and represents over 50% of hearing impairments, but unlike
sensorineural loss, the potential for treatment is high. Conductive loss stems from a diverse set of possible
pathologies, such as ossicular fixation, ossicular disarticulation, or superior-canal dehiscence, each of which
requires a different treatment. Moreover, these distinct pathologies can result from similar physical traumas and
exhibit similar symptoms, which means that in most cases x-ray-based imaging and exploratory surgeries are
used to confirm a suspected pathology. Because of the high cost, risk to the patient, and subjectivity of existing
diagnostic options, an inexpensive, noninvasive measure would be valuable to assess the middle-ear (ME)
status, to reduce uncertainties about the diagnosis prior to surgery, and to monitor outcomes postoperatively.
Wideband tympanometry (WBT), which uses an ear-canal probe to quickly measure the frequency-varying
admittance/impedance of the ME across a range of negative and positive static pressures, could become a cost-
effective tool for noninvasively diagnosing ME pathologies. However, the task of mining complex WBT datasets
for reliable indicators of ME pathologies has proven challenging. Machine learning (ML), with its powerful pattern-
recognition and classification capabilities, may provide a reliable methodology for doing this. However, only very
limited attempts have been made thus far to incorporate ML into ME assessments, mainly due to the lack of
large-enough WBT datasets of confirmed pathologies that are usually required to train ML algorithms. We
propose to train an inference neural network (NN) to perform fast and accurate objective interpretations of WBT
data. To account for the lack of sufficient pathology-identified training data, we propose using synthetic WBT
responses from anatomically realistic finite-element (FE) models of the human ear with verified mechanistic
behavior. Randomly varying the material properties and geometric parameters of the models within normal and
beyond-normal ranges will mimic normal and pathological conditions while accounting for inter-subject variability,
age-related changes to the ME structures, and measurement noise. The inference NN will be trained on this
population of model parameters and responses to produce a probability distribution for each parameter value
whenever it is presented with a new WBT response. Since each model parameter maps to a specific
physiological characteristic of the ME, the predicted parameter values can indicate whether a response exhibits
normal or pathological characteristics. Next, the NN knowledge will be expanded by applying transfer learning
to the limited available clinical WBT data of confirmed pathological cases, along with additional noninvasive
clinical data such as audiograms and air–bone gap measurements. The outcome of the project will be a trained
inference NN for noninvasive objective assessments of the likelihood that a given ear has one (or more) of
various conductive pathologies. Its use could reduce the need for or avoid unnecessary exploratory surgery,
improve the specificity of preoperative preparations, and provide a low-cost means of postoperative monitoring."
10839980,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD), AD-related dementias (ADRD) and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) exhibit pathogenic gene-environment interactions (GxE) with synergistic effects of exposure to an environmental chemical/pathogen and genotype. Recent progress in next- generation sequencing has expedited the discovery of genetic risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease, AD-related dementias and Parkinson’s disease. Yet, identified genetic factors only account for a fraction of patients, and not all patients with the identified genetic risks develop disease. This is exasperated for AD/ADRD/PD as it is convoluted with many covariates over a person’s lifetime. To elucidate the contribution of GxE to disease we propose an approach based on the principles of latent-persistent effects of environmental neurotoxicants; and the developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis. We seek to test the hypothesis that persistent neurotoxicity is due to exposures altering self-perpetuating homeostatic processes that give the resiliency and perpetuity to the adverse toxicological processes by either genetic and/or epigenetic means. Specifically, we will collect samples from same-sex siblings in northern Indiana that phenotypically differ in AD/ADRD/PD relevant cognitive and motor dysfunction phenotypes; reprogram blood cells into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); differentiate them into cortical and midbrain lineages; and characterize their vulnerability to induction of a persistent neurotoxic state caused by neurodevelopmental exposures to environmental hazard/toxicants relevant to this region and history. We expect to identify a persistent neurotoxic state with a conserved response shared across individuals at the level of the genetic/epigenetic pathways evoked. 'Age-related signaling' networks have been defined as central pathways regulating healthy lifespan and aging and are thus expected as a shared network feature conferred by GxE risks. Our innovative approach will leverage single-cell genomics approaches and pathway analysis to identify mechanisms activated by subject-specific GxE to cause a persistent neurotoxic state with only a small subject size and low FDR. The following aims will test our hypothesis and validate the shared signaling networks: Aim 1: Identify subject by toxicant interactions contributing to persistent neurotoxicity using human cells derived from paired Alzheimer's disease, AD-related dementias and Parkinson’s disease and healthy cohort with comparable exposure histories; Aim 2: Identify genetic pathways associated with establishing a persistent neurotoxic state via single-cell genomics and bioinformatic comparisons to population level data; and Aim 3: Validate the genetic pathways of GxE induction of persistent neurotoxicity with in vivo and in vitro models. This work seeks to understand how past environmental exposures influence AD/ADRD/PD disease risk and incidence by utilizing an interdisciplinary academic- community partnership to study elderly subjects at risk for AD/ADRD/PD. The findings may also identify targets of the GxE interactions that contribute to the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, AD-related dementias and Parkinson’s disease over our lifetime."
10841815,"Abstract
Two emphasis areas are proposed which are underpinned by synthetic organic chemistry. First, new synthetic
methodology to access exceptionally rare nitrogen-rich compounds will be developed to expand the availability
of medicinally relevant, densely functionalized heterocycles. We pioneered new methodology to synthesize the
rare diazacyclobutene (DCB) heterocycle. Less than ten examples of stable DCBs where previously known. The
dearth of examples has prevented their application in any biological or synthetic context. Nevertheless,
preliminary biological investigations show that some DCBs exhibit potent anti-parasitic activity, suggesting that
further development of the scaffold may unlock additional biological activity relevant to human disease.
Accessing new examples of DCBs will enable biological evaluation and expansion of the synthetic utility of the
heterocycle. Exploiting new reactivity of DCBs and related intermediates will provide new methods to synthesize
a large variety of medicinally relevant, richly functionalized heterocycles through the development of cascade
reactions of labile monocyclic DCB intermediates. Similarly, the intentional diversion of key reactive
intermediates with Lewis Acids will access additional rare heterocycles through novel mechanisms. The second
emphasis area will develop new non-microbicidal tool compounds to interrogate the polysaccharide metabolism
of gut bacteria of the Bacteroides genus. The enzymatic machinery deployed by the Bacteroides genus serves
as a model system to understand glycan foraging strategies deployed by the entire Bacteroidetes phylum, which
represents over half of the constituents of a normal healthy microbiota). Presently, our lab has uncovered the
only known chemical probes to interrogate this fundamental system governing carbohydrate utilization by
prominent gut microbes. Additionally, Bacteroides spp. are associated with common anaerobic bacterial
infections affecting multiple organ systems, sepsis, gut inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and colorectal
cancer. Building on our prior discovery that the natural product acarbose shuts down the Starch Utilization
System (Sus) of Bacteroides spp., we will synthesize useful chemical probes to interrogate this fundamental
metabolic pathway deployed by prominent gut microbes for eventual therapeutic gain. Thus, we will provide tools
to clarify the mechanism of action of acarbose-induced arrest of bacterial starch metabolism by deploying
synthetic analogs bearing fluorophores and photoaffinity tags. This will also provide key fundamental knowledge
about the promiscuity of the probe with other Sus-like constructs. We will uncover potential downstream effects
on virulence factors (i.e. biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and toxin production) in the organisms upon
acarbose-mediated shutdown of the Sus. This work will lay important groundwork toward providing versatile tools
to understand gut microbial metabolism as it pertains to human disease. We will also significantly expand
synthetic access to new probe molecules capable of interrogating the Sus as well as other related enzyme suites
that are leveraged by a majority of human gut microbes."
10847346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disorder of unknown etiology with a median survival of only
2-3 years. The rate of disease progression for individuals with IPF is highly variable. Rapid progression occurs
in only 20-30% of patients but is responsible for 75% of IPF-related deaths. A major problem facing clinicians is
that they are unable to identify patients that will experience rapid progression until after irreversible lung
function decline occurs. Dr. Newton has previously demonstrated that pathogenic genetic variants in telomere-
maintenance genes predispose to rapid progression; however, these static genetic variants alone do not
explain the extreme heterogeneity in IPF clinical course. The variability in clinical course is strongly influenced
by environmental exposures such as cigarette smoke or inflammation, which can alter chromatin structure and
availability of gene regulatory elements, thus reprogramming gene expression profiles that produce divergent
IPF disease course phenotypes. Therefore, Dr. Newton hypothesizes that integrating chromatin accessibility
with gene expression will allow for the discovery of novel molecular markers and biologically relevant driver
pathways that differentiate IPF disease course phenotypes. Along these lines, his Specific Aims are to 1)
identify IPF patients at high-risk for short-term rapid progression using clinical, genomic, epigenetic, and gene
expression signatures, 2) discover gene regulatory elements and biologic pathways that are associated with
rapid IPF progression, and 3) identify changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression that correspond
to acute IPF exacerbations. To accomplish these aims, he has established a prospective IPF cohort designed
to perform serial blood collection while simultaneously quantifying the rate of IPF progression. Using RNA and
DNA from blood lymphocytes of IPF patients collected longitudinally as their disease evolves, he will integrate
transcriptome patterns with chromatin features to identify biologic pathways in easily accessible blood cells that
signify high-risk IPF. The data generated from these aims will form the foundation for two subsequent
independent proposals that will seek to validate a blood-based molecular profile that identifies IPF patients at
high-risk for rapid progression, and explore and biologically validate the influence epigenetic regulation on
gene expression patterns and driver pathways within the context of IPF disease course. Dr. Newton has a
sustained track record of high-impact translational research using genetic and genomic markers to predict
clinical outcomes in pulmonary fibrosis. This K23 will allow him to obtain the necessary training to expand his
technical skills and expertise in developing and validating novel biomarkers, constructing clinically useful
prediction models, and integrating next-generation sequencing technologies. His mentoring team is composed
of highly accomplished scientific mentors with expertise in genetics, epigenetics, molecular biology,
bioinformatics, statistics, and IPF disease behavior. This K23 is geared toward his goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist whose research improves the clinical care of IPF patients."
10847488,"PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of the Duke Women's Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) career development
program is to develop a cohort of highly skilled obstetrician/gynecologist (Ob-Gyn) researchers with expertise
in research methodology reinforced by an understanding of the resources, skills, and tools needed to build a
successful long-lasting career as Ob-Gyn clinician-investigators. We will leverage deep Institutional and
Departmental expertise, infrastructure and commitment to research career development to: (1) identify and
recruit Scholars from diverse backgrounds and provide individualized mentoring and career development
support in an environment of team science, (2) train this cohort of researchers by fostering state-of-the-art
multidisciplinary research emphasizing the importance of diverse and innovative scientific methods, and (3)
provide the skills and resources needed to lead their own multidisciplinary teams, ultimately becoming mentors
for a new generation of clinician-investigators who will strengthen the field of Ob-Gyn. To achieve these aims,
we have assembled a group of experienced mentors across 6 areas of excellence aligned with departmental
and institutional expertise and priorities: 1) Reproductive Infectious Disease and Immunology; 2) Gynecologic
Cancer; 3) Peri-conceptional Wellness and Early Human Development; 4) Pregnancy and Perinatology; 5)
Pelvic Floor Disorders and 6) Innovative Research Methods. Two Scholars will be supported at any one time,
with Scholars spending 2-5 years in mentored research training with a specific focus on topics relevant to the
clinical practice of Ob-Gyn and its subspecialties. The Duke WRHR program builds on two successful existing
K12 programs that are directed by experienced leadership in our department to create a dynamic career
development program specifically for Ob-Gyns dedicated to women's reproductive health. The associated well-
established infrastructure and tested approach to career development includes: creation of individualized
career development plans, intense hands-on research on specific defined research projects, selection of a
complimentary mentoring team, didactic course work, seminars, workshops, peer scholar group meetings,
training in responsible conduct of research, and executive coaching to refine leadership skills. Scholar
progress will be closely monitored by the Program Director and Research Director, as well as an Advisory
Committee. We have built in mechanisms for feedback from both internal and external stakeholders and a
novel evaluation plan to help the program better understand the gains experienced by Scholars. At the
completion of the program, Scholars will be expected to have published their WRHR research in peer-reviewed
journals and obtained independent funding. By building on the outstanding ongoing research relevant to
women's reproductive health at Duke, the comprehensive career development resources available, and the
Ob-Gyn department's track record in leading career development programs, the Duke WRHR program will
create the next generation of research leaders in women's reproductive health."
10848308,"Project Summary:
This project develops cell and animal models to understand the role of a multivalent transcription factor,
ZNF423, in integrating information from extracellular signaling and intracellular lineage pathways during
hindbrain development. ZNF423 encodes a constitutively nuclear transcriptional regulatory protein that
binds lineage differentiation factors of the EBF family and transcriptional effectors for canonical signling
pathways, including SMAD, retinoic acid, and NOTCH intracellular domains. ZNF423 mutations are
reported in rare Joubert syndrome (JBTS19) and nephronophthisis (NPHP14) ciliopathy patients. The
ciliopathies comprise a broad family of individually rare disorders unified by signaling defects in
primary cilia. Clinical presentations range mild to lethal and from primary involvement of a single organ
to more pleiotropic presentations. The overwhelming majority of genes identified for ciliopathy disorders
encode physical components of primary cilia. Regulatory genes that control cilium-dependent
signaling and genetic modifiers that change the outcome of ciliary defects remain understudied with
respect to pathogenic mechanisms and potential points for intervention in more typical cases.
ZNF423 is thought to comprise an integrative node among several transcriptional complexes that
respond to classical intercellular signals during brain development and to regulate SHH signaling
through the primary cilium. Both reported patients and mouse models show hindbrain malformations
that include hypoplasia or agenesis of the vermis. Aim 1 will test hypotheses for ZNF423 activity in
canalizing information from complex signaling environments into predictable cell responses. Aim 2 will
comprehensively test for modifier genes that alter cellular outcomes ex vivo in response to loss of
ZNF423. Aim 3 will test hypotheses for ZNF423 participation in oligogenic brain malformations in a
well-validated animal model."
10848345,"The Role of Menopause-Driven DNA Damage and Epigenetic Dysregulation in Alzheimer's Disease
PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide, and 2 out of 3 patients are women.
A central explanation for this higher prevalence is thought to be the fluctuations in sex hormones as women
traverse menopause, prior to depletion of estrogen and progesterone in the post-menopause period. Menopause
has been reported to cause changes in epigenetic modifications, including histone acetylation which we and
others have shown to be important to prevent memory decline in AD models. We have also observed sex-specific
differences in AD-related genes in the brain of aged 3xTg-AD mice. Surprisingly little is known about the effects
of the menopausal transition on epigenetic mechanisms in the brain. Important, aging is strongly associated with
dysregulation of DNA damage repair, a process that has also been linked to menopause. Our preliminary data
analyzing some 300 human brains show that DNA Single Strand Break (SSB) repair enzymes are dysregulated
with age. We hypothesize that beyond its effects on reproductive stages in females, the menopause transition
modulates DNA damage response (DDR) and epigenetic mechanisms. This results in the biological differences
observed between female and male AD patients' mind and body. Existing AD models studying menopause use
ovariectomized mice, resulting in an abrupt termination of circulating estrogen. We believe this is not
representative of the menopause transition in women, in which peri-menopausal hormonal fluctuations can last
years. We have successfully implemented accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) in mice to mimic human
menopause. Here, using both the 3xTg-AD and 5xFAD mice under AOF, we will assess the effects of peri- and
post-menopause-like stages on DNA SSB, the epigenetic landscape and the subsequent impact on the
transcriptome and metabolic homeostasis in brain and blood in the context of AD. We developed a method to
map Single-Strand DNA breaks at Nucleotide Genome Level resolution (SSiNGLe) that allows high-resolution
analysis of DNA SSBs to determine the “Breakome age” of individuals, a potential novel biomarker of aging. We
will build network models (associating SSBs with transcriptome alterations) to better understand how
menopause-driven defects in DNA repair impact on known AD and Aging pathways. We will verify pathway
observations using our human brain and AD case-control blood transcriptomics data (and public domain data)
and identify which significant networks match to drug-signatures and/or any druggable targets. Completion of
the work proposed will enhance our understanding of the role that menopause-induced DNA damage plays in
both aging and AD. Specifically, we will: (1) elucidate the spatiotemporal relationship between DNA SSBs, DNA
methylation, and neurotrophic gene transcription in the brain during the menopause transition, (2) define a
timeline for the critical therapeutic window prior to the post-menopause stage where memory deficits are
observed, and (3) discover connections between menopause-associated DNA SSB in the brain and in peripheral
lymphocytes that can be used as biomarkers in future clinical studies for aging and AD research."
10848349,"The overall objective of this application is to lay the foundation for a sustainable program of population-based
research into Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in Nepal. To that end, the project seeks to
initiate a series of research capacity building activities and develop a new, population-based, longitudinal
cohort study of ADRD and related age-associated chronic health conditions in this population. Population aging
is becoming increasingly more common in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). As a result, these
countries face the growing burden of common age-associated chronic illnesses, including ADRD. Nepal is a
low middle-income country where the population is now aging, putting a rising number of adults at risk of
developing ADRD. There is virtually no research capacity in Nepal to investigate the scope and primary
determinants of ADRD, and even the most basic information on ADRD is currently lacking. Such information is
urgently needed to guide the development of prevention strategies and reduce the burden of ADRD in this
country. Capacity building activities will focus on training in survey data collection methods with a primary focus
on ascertainment of ADRD and statistical methods for the analysis of complex data from longitudinal panel
surveys. The activities will consist of workshops with hands-on experience in the design and administration of
cognitive assessments to identify ADRD in the general population, and in statistical analysis methods for
longitudinal data from complex surveys. The project will also begin a new, longitudinal cohort study of ADRD
designed to fill substantial gaps in information on ADRD and its primary risk factors in Nepal. It will focus on
two novel risk factors with particular salience to understand the burden of ADRD in Nepal. The first involves the
role of international labor migration: a substantial portion of Nepali adults spend prolonged periods of
adulthood working in other countries to earn income for their families, often in challenging situations. The
second risk factor involves the long-term effects of exposure to armed conflict that has affected this population
for 10 years (1996-2006). The impact of labor migration and armed conflict on ADRD risk is currently unknown.
The study will leverage the data collection infrastructure that has been developed for the Chitwan Valley Family
Study, a population survey of >10,000 participants aged 15-59 that started in 1996. The cohort is now aging,
providing a unique opportunity to begin a new population study of ADRD and other chronic health conditions.
The study will include the estimated 4,000 surviving participants who have now become age-eligible (> 50) for
this study. This sample will be invited for a baseline interview, including a detailed cognitive assessment, and a
follow-up interview two years later. Outcomes from the capacity building and research activities will be shared
with relevant stakeholders and organizations in Nepal to inform local solutions and policies for the prevention
and treatment of ADRD in this population. We anticipate that much of this work will have relevance for other
low-resource, low-income countries that face similar circumstances and challenges as Nepal."
10848401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a serious national crisis that affects public health and economic welfare, even
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation policies to prevent the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 upended social networks, healthcare access, led to historically high unemployment, and
amplified pre-existing community and economic vulnerability. Communities of color were hardest hit and
highlight pre-pandemic disparities in health, mortality, and well-being, including structural community
contextual factors that affect health. The pandemic also led to the highest overdose death toll since 2017.
While we know that social isolation can amplify and reinforce OUD, it is unclear which components of SARS-
CoV-2 mitigation efforts and resulting social, economic and healthcare disruptions differentially influenced
individuals with existing/at-risk of OUD. Additionally, we do not know if the impacts were concentrated in
communities with a higher pre-pandemic rate of OUD and/or were disproportionately adversely affected by
economic factors or COVID-19 cases/deaths. The goal of this study is to leverage large comprehensive
claims and electronic health data, capturing nearly half of the U.S. population from before the
pandemic through 2026, to test our hypothesis that social and economic vulnerabilities, as well as economic
side effects of the pandemic will escalate the prevalence of OUD and related harms. Building on our extensive
existing work, we use quasi-experimental methods to measure adverse OUD-related outcomes and worsening
health disparities using existing records capturing longitudinal OUD and COVID-19 incidence at the individual
patient and community levels. In Aim 1, we evaluate whether OUD outcomes during the first nine months have
been worse among communities that had been harder hit by the opioid epidemic pre-pandemic or have
experienced disparately higher incidence of COVID-19 morbidity/mortality during the pandemic. In Aim 2, we
evaluate longer-run OUD trajectories for communities that experienced 1) greater degrees of economic loss, 2)
higher COVID-19 morbidity/mortality, and 3) have disparate levels of vaccination uptake over the first five
years. We further examine disparities in OUD outcomes and leverage individual longitudinal data for
particularly vulnerable subpopulations (pregnancy, adolescents, disability, older adults). At the successful
completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes are defined policy relevant factors that will reflect
the net health and mortality impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on OUD diagnoses, treatment initiation and
adherence, utilization, and mortality over the short- and longer- terms. Ultimately, this research will support NIH
NIDA’s goals, identifying COVID-19’s impact on OUD and populations at risk for being medically underserved
in this complex yet vulnerable population."
10848402,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed project’s goal is to develop organic synthesis methodologies for potential applications in
biochemistry and medicinal science to solve important problems (optimizing API production process and
providing new methods for lead compound preparation etc.), which could ultimately benefit human health.
Previous work by this project’s research team has focused on developing new transition metal catalysts
with applications for challenging chemical transformation to reach an efficient synthesis of diverse
chemicals for medicinal and biological research. Recently, with the employment of strong oxidants or
photoactivation conditions, gold(I) oxidation to gold(III) were realized, despite the intrinsic high oxidation
potential. These discoveries further advanced the field of gold catalysis, adding redox chemistry as an
alternative path into the catalytic cycle. However, major hurdles in the current gold catalytic system exist
that limit its full utility to promote some typical chemical synthesis such as asymmetric transformations in
redox chemistry, accessing vinyl-gold intermediate without rapid protodeauration, and integration of gold p-
acid reactivity with redox chemistry, etc. The proposed project will address these hurdles by developing
new strategies and catalysts and by providing new medicinally important avenues toward structures which
are often difficult to access. The project aim will address two fundamental questions in the gold catalysis:
1) Can asymmetric gold redox catalysis be achieved through chiral ligand control with gold(I) as the resting
state? and 2) Will the integration of multiple gold catalysis reaction modes (p-acid, vinyl-gold and redox
chemistry) be integrated in one cycle to achieve highly efficient transformations with good stereoselectivity.
Our research program will focus on the following four specific directions: 1) developing new oxidation
conditions to achieve gold oxidation for a broader scope of substrates for gold redox catalysis; 2) applying
gold/iron dual catalytic system to access vinyl-gold reactivity for direct C-C and C-X bond construction and
macrocyclic compound synthesis; 3) applying chiral N,P ligand to achieve enantioselective alkene di-
functionalization to provide the key factors that might influence asymmetric gold redox catalysis; and 4)
developing new triazole-based chiral ligands systems to achieve gold(III) asymmetric catalysis for rapid and
stereoselective C-C and C-X bond constructions. The research’s expected outcomes will result in new
strategies and methods for alternative approaches toward biomedically important molecules and new
building blocks as molecular probes or potential therapeutic solution."
10848411,"The proposed project will create novel multidimensional models to characterize the prelinguistic developmental
pathways leading to verbal and minimally verbal (MV) outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Children with ASD experience significant delays in the development of prelinguistic communication
(PLC) skills that are important indicators of progress along a path towards language. PLC skills include
vocalizations, gestures, joint attention, and comprehension. As many as 30% of children with ASD remain MV,
producing very few if any spoken words by the time they reach kindergarten. Significant gaps remain in our
knowledge of early risk factors that predispose children to remain MV. In particular, further research is needed
to identify specific inflection points that are indicative of risk for not progressing to spoken language. The
proposed innovative modeling framework will assess whether transitions between specific prelinguistic stages
and the timing of these transitions represent risk for MV outcomes. Crucially, the project will develop a novel
method for quantifying a child’s risk of a MV outcome at age 5 given their PLC progressions at earlier points in
development. Such information could guide and focus early intervention efforts, such as intensifying therapies
at certain points in development and/or deciding when to introduce augmentative or alternative communication.
The key innovation in this proposal is leveraging Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models to delineate
progressions of PLC across dimensions of attention, vocalizations, gestures, and comprehension from 18-36
months in children with ASD, and to identify unique multidimensional trajectories that predict which children
remain MV at age 5. The proposal will test the hypothesis that children who are transitioning between PLC
stages more slowly or following atypical patterns of progression are at higher risk for MV outcomes. Aim 1 will
develop and validate state-based models of development of attention, vocalizations, gestures, and
comprehension in a well-characterized sample of typically developing children and separately, children with
ASD (Activity 1a), and then construct a multidimensional model that unifies the individual models to
simultaneously examine progressions across the four dimensions (Activity 1b). Models will be first validated on
a sample of 50 typically developing children observed every 3 months from 6 to 18 months of age, and then
separately validated on a sample of 100 children with ASD observed every 3 months from diagnosis at 18-24
through 36 months of age. Aim 2 will utilize the ASD model from 1b to identify predictors for MV status at 5
years in children with ASD (Activity 2a) and apply a survival analysis approach to turn these predictors into a
quantifiable risk score for MV outcome (Activity 2b).
The models along with the underlying training data will be released to the research community, enabling ASD
and developmental researchers with novel datasets to assess the extent to which their data is consistent with
ours, thus advancing the field of developmental science and laying the foundations for targeted interventions."

The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System
(PRMS) oversees and provides independent peer review of the scientific merit, priority, and progress of all cancer
studies involving human subjects conducted across Georgetown University, MedStar Washington Hospital
Center, and John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridien Health. PRMS functions are accomplished by
rigorous review in a two-stage process conducted by: (1) Disease Groups (DGs) and (2) the Protocol Review
and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), Co-Chaired by Geoffrey Gibney, MD, and Martin Gutierrez, MD. The PRMC
is the definitive independent authority for determining which studies proceed to activation. LCCC has 14 formal
DGs, each with an appointed faculty leader and co-leaders. DGs are responsible for initial assessment of value,
merit, feasibility, and prioritization of new potential studies within their existing portfolio of trials as well as
monitoring ongoing studies for accrual and scientific merit. The primary goal of the PRMC is to ensure that all
LCCC cancer research studies involving human subjects are deemed: (1) scientifically sound; (2) effectively

The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) proposes to develop a new T34 training program (MIZZOU MARC)
that will train undergraduate students from groups that are underrepresented in biomedical research to enter
PhD programs on the way to becoming successful scientists pursuing careers in the biomedical workforce.
Underrepresented (UR) groups include students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds
(underrepresented minorities or URM), low income (Pell-eligible) students, and students with disabilities. The
mission of our training program is to facilitate the transformation of first-year and second-year students
interested in research into seniors who matriculate into doctoral programs, with the technical, operational and
professional skills that contribute to success in graduate school. To accomplish this mission, we have
established the following eight objectives:
 Objective #1: To develop and maintain an inclusive and supportive Research Apprentice community
 of 1st and 2nd year students.
 Objective #2: To provide 1st and 2nd year students with opportunities to explore their interests in
research.
 Objective #3: To select a cohort of 10 rising juniors to be MIZZOU MARC trainees for their junior
 and senior years.
 Objective #4: To provide multiple opportunities for the MIZZOU MARC trainees to present their
 research at national research conferences.
 Objective #5: To provide training in responsible conduct of research (RCR) and in methods to
 enhance reproducibility.
 Objective #6. To provide training in the communication of scientific ideas through manuscripts and
 research proposals.
 Objective #7: To increase the number of trainees that continue in a biomedical research career after
 graduation from MU.
 Objective #8: To develop robust levels of science self-efficacy, science identity, perceived supports,
 and satisfaction with mentoring relationships among the MIZZOU MARC trainees.
The MIZZOU MARC T34 program will implement a wide-ranging set of programmatic activities to achieve the
stated Objectives. The programmatic activities, based on best practices for retention and training of students
from UR backgrounds, as described in the literature, will develop the technical, operational and professional
skills that will enable our trainees to flourish in graduate school and develop successful careers as PhD
scientists."
10848292,"ABSTRACT
 Women have more rapid cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk development compared to men during young
adulthood; yet, little research has studied factors that could curtail CVD risk development during this critical
period for young women. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-Be Heart Health
Study (nuMoM2b HHS) is a unique, multi-center, longitudinal cohort, originating during the first pregnancy, that
is now studying associations between adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) and modifiable CVD risk in women.
This ancillary application to nuMoM2b HHS aims to test our hypotheses that sedentary behavior (SED) is a key,
modifiable risk factor for CVD risk development in young women, including those with APO.
 SED is low-intensity behavior in a seated, reclining, or lying posture and has recently been identified as a CVD
risk factor that is distinct from insufficient moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity (MVPA). Acute prolonged sitting
results in marked, adverse responses such as increased blood pressure (BP), glucose, and lipids. Yet, major
research gaps preclude the development and testing of specific SED-reduction interventions, especially for
young women. Most studies measure SED poorly (e.g., by self-report) and do not statistically consider that SED
is part of an all-day activity pattern (or composition). Further, mechanisms of how SED leads to CVD are unclear,
further limiting intervention development. Last, almost no studies focus on young women. Our preliminary data
suggest that SED is strongly associated with APOs and reduced cardiovascular health (e.g., BP) in young women
post-pregnancy. Further, our laboratory has recently demonstrated novel associations between SED and
mechanistic CVD measures, including greater arterial stiffness (higher pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and worse
autonomic function (lower heart rate variability [HRV]). Collectively, SED is a novel, understudied risk factor for
reduced cardiovascular health that our data suggest is highly relevant for young women.
 We have a unique, efficient, and time-sensitive opportunity to address these gaps by adding gold standard
SED assessment via activPAL thigh-mounted accelerometer to the upcoming HHS2 exam. In this contemporary
and diverse female cohort (n=4,050, age=36±6 years), we aim to quantify cross-sectional and longitudinal
associations of SED with the clinical components of idea cardiovascular health (BP, BMI, total cholesterol, fasting
glucose) by using state-of-the-art statistical methods that consider the compositional nature of SED and 24-hr
activity and can correct existing, longitudinal self-reported SED via regression calibration. Also, we add HRV and
PWV in Pittsburgh and Indiana (n=950) to efficiently study associations between SED and subclinical,
mechanistic CVD outcomes in young women. Aim 3 will study interrelationships of SED, APO history, and ideal
cardiovascular health to identify novel risk reductions strategies in this high-risk group with limited treatment
options. This research will provide critical data to rigorously link SED, CVD risk, and contributing mechanisms
and will inform age- and sex-specific SED interventions to test in young women, including those with APO."
10848293,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic
contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in
Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to
ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the
eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to
design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a
current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having
recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to
transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and
portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test
reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes
participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our
ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined
with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically,
racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the
Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with
eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine
initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical
management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural
language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype
interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic
predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim
3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining
patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR
plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family
history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial
design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health
surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk
assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to
precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties."
10848374,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intersecting structural conditions, including racism and other systems of oppression create structural adversity
that impacts health and life expectancy, especially for Black Americans and other racialized communities. The
proposed mixed-methods research will collect new data to complement a wealth of existing longitudinal data
previously collected at key developmental stages over more than three decades from two ethnically, racially, and
socioeconomically diverse cohorts from the Harlem Longitudinal Development Study and the Children in the
Community Study. The sample will consist of 450 Black, Latinx and white adults previously surveyed in
childhood/early adolescence, emerging adulthood, young adulthood, and midlife. The proposed research,
informed by the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory, will quantify and contextualize the
assocations of exposure to structural adversity, namely individual-level life-course experiences of adversity
within and across institutions and social contexts over the life course (e.g., stigma/discrimination, socioeconomic
disadvantage) and neighborhood-level ethnic-racial inequality with stress regulation, epigenetic modifications
(i.e., epigentic age), and mental health (i.e., psychological distress, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress,
race-based traumatic stress). This will be accomplished using four forms of data that will be triangulated to
optimize results and interpretation: survey, biological, qualitative, and U.S. Census data. The proposed research
will also include innovative development and validation of a new Intersectional Stigma in Context tool (ISIC) that
will be compared and contrasted with existing stigma/discrimination measures. The quantitative survey and
biological data will facilitate comprehensive analysis of racialized differences in structural adversity and its
association with stress regulation, epigenetic aging, and mental health. These analyses will be further
contextualized through in-depth interviews with a purposive sample selected from the study cohort. The
qualitative data will innovatively provide deeper understanding and interpretation of structural adversity over the
life course, including stigma/discrimination, stress, resilience, and other salient experiences that are often missed
by quantitative data, including contexualized information of past generations. Further, this research will identify
protective factors that can mitigate the deleterious sequelae of adversity and thus highlight areas of resilience
that can be leveraged in interventions. In conclusion, identifying how racism and intersecting systems of
oppression permeate and reproduce social conditions that manifest at the individual and neighborhood levels –
creating structural adversity – will be examined for it’s association with biological stress regulation, epigenetic
aging, and mental health. This will constitute a crucial step towards changing policies and systems that stand in
the way of realizing the attainment of the highest level of health for all people, an explicit goal of the Healthly
People initiative."

substantial in-kind support during the next funding cycle."
10848476,"Project Summary
Pressure ulcers affect 2.5 million people in the United States and cost the healthcare system an estimated 11.6
billion dollars annually. A major percentage of affected individuals are over sixty-five years of age and this
number is growing rapidly in the United States. A greater incidence of immobility, vascular disease and diabetes
is commonly seen in aged populations and places them at an increased risk for developing pressure ulcers.
Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new therapies that will effectively treat pressure ulcers in the aged.
With prior NIA support, we have found that aging is characterized by the progressive loss of critical molecular
and cellular pathways responsible for normal wound healing, specifically hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-
1α). We have also identified that these changes can be reversed using an FDA-approved small molecule drug,
deferoxamine (DFO). Building on our preliminary data, we will first define the aberrations of HIF-1α in healthy,
unwounded skin from young and aged patients (Specific Aim 1). We will then confirm the HIF-1α signaling
dysfunction in pressure ulcers using biopsy specimens from both young and aged patients. (Specific Aim 2). To
define the alterations in hypoxia signaling within the skin cells of young versus aged patients, we will subject the
collected tissue for protein analysis and single cell sequencing. We will then determine the optimal delivery
system for DFO through both intact stratum corneum as required for treating pressure ulcers in a porcine model
(Specific Aim 3). This large animal model is selected since porcine skin has significant similarities to the human
skin. Our results will validate the effectiveness of our drug delivery system and provide a novel strategy to deliver
other hydrophilic small molecule drugs across intact human skin. Taken together, this pre-clinical study will lay
the groundwork for a pilot human trial targeted at treating pressure ulcers with the transdermal DFO delivery
system, which will for the first time provide a pharmacologic therapy to treat pressure ulcers in aged patients."
10848478,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuroinflammation and innate immune response have emerged as the forefront pathology of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Accumulated evidence has shown that Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the most significant AD
genetic risk factor, confers a pro-inflammatory state in the normal aging and AD brains. However, most studies
have centered around the roles of APOE4 in disrupting the homeostatic functions of astrocytes and microglia in
brain parenchyma. Recent discoveries of a lymphatic system in the dura meninges and a repertoire of immune
cells at brain borders have highlighted the critical role of border immunity in brain aging and AD. APOE is highly
expressed in the border-associated macrophages (BAMs), dura lymphatic vessels, and choroid plexus. Thus,
those studies raise a critical question on whether APOE4 regulates the border-associated immunity in normal
aging and AD. Despite the recent single-cell transcriptomic study on mouse BAMs18, little information exists on
cell states of human brain borders related to normal aging and AD, neither the APOE4’s effects on border cell
states, immunity, and functions. The overall goal of this application is to investigate the effect of APOE
alleles on cell states and functions of human brain borders in normal aging and AD. Our central
hypothesis is that AD and APOE4 alter cell states in brain border regions, and APOE4 exacerbates
molecular and cellular phenotypes in control and AD isogenic border cell models. We formulated this
hypothesis based on literature as mentioned above and our transcriptomic analysis showing distinct cell
transcriptomic signature and strong APOE expression in BAMs at human brain borders. We will test this
hypothesis by combining single-cell multi-omics profiling of ex vivo human border regions and in vitro border
region modeling. Specifically, we will first profile the single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility from the
same cells of postmortem meninges and choroid plexus of APOE4 and non-APOE4 carriers from control and AD
individuals. This Aim will enable us to reveal cell types, cell states, regional specificity, and intercellular
communications at human brain borders and identify upstream master regulators of AD- and APOE4-specific cell
states (Aim 1). To study the APOE4’s functions in human brain borders, we will develop multicellular choroid
plexus 3D models by introducing iPSC-derived immune cells to choroid plexus organoids. We will then generate
control and AD isogenic choroid plexus models carrying either APOE3 or APOE4 alleles to examine the
APOE4’s cellular, molecular, and functional effects in both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners
(Aim 2). Our study will shed significant insights into human border-associated immunity and reveal a novel
mechanism underlying AD pathophysiology. The upstream regulators of AD- and APOE4-specific cell states
identified in this study will serve as ideal therapeutic targets for modulating the brain border immunity. Our
choroid plexus model provides a tractable system to test other genetic targets, extrinsic factors, and candidate
drugs, opening a new avenue of targeting the brain borders for AD therapeutic interventions."
10848479,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Declines in ovarian function are closely associated with reductions in healthspan and longevity. Numerous
studies have linked ovarian dysfunction to systemic organismal aging, although very little is known with regard
to the basic, intrinsic mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate age-related ovarian functional declines. These
knowledge gaps represent a critical barrier to developing treatments aimed at attenuating age-related ovarian
failure. Ovarian aging is characterized by the progressive depletion of quiescent primordial follicles, which
eventually leads to irregular patterns of ovulation and disruption of the ovarian endocrine milieu. This project will
systemically explore how cell-type specific changes in cellular senescence and epigenetics/genomic
organization contribute to age-related ovarian failure through the use of novel transgenic NuTRAP models that
allow for the isolation of nucleic acids (DNA & RNA) specifically from oocytes, granulosa cells, or theca cells
without the need for cell sorting. Successful completion of this project will determine: 1) what role cellular
senescence and epigenetic modifications play in primordial follicle exhaustion, 2) if age-related cellular
senescence and epigenetic modifications occur in a cell-type specific fashion along differing timelines, 3) if
epigenetic changes precede or follow the emergence of cellular senescence, and 4) if the removal of senescent
cells and/or the suppression of the SASP through senolytic drug treatment can extend reproductive lifespan. We
hypothesize that granulosa cells encapsulating primordial follicles accumulate deleterious cellular and epigenetic
alterations, undergo a senescence-like transition, and thereby accelerate primordial follicle growth and
maturation, thereby leading to exhaustion. We will test this hypothesis through following aims. Specific Aim 1:
Characterize cell type-specific changes in markers of cellular senescence in oocytes, granulosa, and theca cells
from the aging ovary. We predict that senescence cell burden and inflammatory mediators will increase with
advancing age and that granulosa cells are a major source of this phenotype. Specific Aim 2: Characterize cell
type-specific changes in epigenetic alterations and transcriptional profiles within oocytes, granulosa, and theca
cells from the aging ovary. We predict that the majority of age-related changes will be cell-specific and that
`epigenetic clocks' of distinct cell types advance at different rates. We also anticipate that granulosa cells will
display the greatest changes in epigenetic and transcriptional profiles and that this will correspond to declines in
ovarian primordial follicle reserve. Aim 3: Determine if the clearance of senescent cells within the ovary restores
ovarian function and prolongs reproductive fitness. We predict that senolytic treatment will increase the number
of primordial follicles and that oocytes will accumulate less DNA damage with chronological aging. We also
anticipate that this will result in a greater production of embryos with less DNA damage, thereby increasing the
number of pregnancies, litters, and pups born to older female mice. The ultimate goal of this research is to
develop clinical interventions that extend reproductive lifespan for systemic health benefits."

Abstract
Community engagement is an essential component to effective research that can result in a variety of benefits
including (1) increasing trust among communities and the agencies that serve them, (2) generating more
effective solutions, and (3) increasing the likelihood that it is widely accepted by the community. Florida
International University (FIU) is one of the largest public universities in the nation and a federally designated
minority-serving institution (MSI). FIU has a long-standing tradition of using its research resources, knowledge,
and outcomes for improving the health and well-being of neighboring communities. During FIU-RCMI's initial
funding cycle (September 2017- June 2021), the Community Engagement Core (CEC) was successful in
accomplishing its original goals and considerably expanded its community-engaged research efforts through
COVID-19-related supplements and CEAL grant funding. For this renewal period, the CEC will seek to
leverage this success by proposing to expand and strengthen bidirectional linkages with community-based
organizations (CBOs) and provide stakeholders with opportunities to contribute to the design, implementation,
and dissemination of the FIU-RCMI's research with medically underserved and vulnerable communities living
in South Florida including Hispanic/Latinx, Black/African American, Haitian, and other Caribbean communities.
During the renewal cycle, the proposed CEC activities and personnel structure involve several innovative
aspects in order to promote community-academic partnerships, enhance the capacity for conducting
community-engaged research, and aid in translational efforts of research findings. The implementation of CEC
core activities will be guided by the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Convene a Community Advisory Board
(CAB) comprised of a broad network of stakeholders to assist in guiding and facilitating the Center's
community-engaged research; Aim 2 - Implement activities that establish and strengthen research partnerships
with community-based organizations (CBOs) in support of health disparities research being conducted at FIU;
and Aim 3 - Facilitate opportunities for training in community-engaged research to enhance both community
and academic capacity for health disparities research. The CEC will work seamlessly with the other FIU-RCMI
Cores through timely communication, regular meetings, and exchanges of information, to closely link
researchers and community leaders. This application demonstrates that the FIU-RCMI CEC is committed to
collaborative, respectful, and action-oriented community engagement as a foundation to creating health equity."

10850561,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2
Recent studies have documented defects in nuclear transport and stress granule/liquid phase transitions as
potentially early events in C9orf72 repeat expansion model systems. However, little is actually known about
how these initial discoveries relate to ALS vs. FTD, two diseases caused by the same mutation. The
hexanucleotide repeat expansion leads to both aberrant RNA as well as dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins made
via non-ATG repeat associated translation (RAN translation). A consensus of studies suggests the mutation
disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport but the mechanism and cell type specificity of this defect remain unclear.
This leads to the important question: how does the same mutation differentially involve cortical neurons versus
spinal motor neurons in clinically distinct diseases? Emerging data also links stress granule-based biology to
nucleocytoplasmic transport in non-neuronal cells. However, whether this is relevant to CNS neurons or glia is
unclear. We will employ a model system based on human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical
neurons and motor neurons from well-defined patients with either C9orf72 FTD, C9orf72 ALS or C9orf72 ALS
and FTD to explore the underlying biological mechanism that may serve to explain the involvement of selective
neuronal and/or glial cell types in these widely differing diseases. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will
comprehensively assess and compare alterations in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and nucleocytoplasmic
transport in C9orf72 ALS/FTD iPSC-derived motor and cortical neurons. Understanding the differences in
motor and cortical neuron nuclear pore complexes will define fundamental neuron-specific biology and may aid
in dissecting the disease-specific pathogenesis in C9orf72 ALS and FTD. In Aim 2, we propose to elucidate
molecular pathways altered by C9orf72 repeat expansions in iPSC-derived motor and cortical neurons.
Interrogating human cortical versus spinal C9orf72 neurons using “omics” analytics will provide insight into cell-
specific defects and opportunities for mitigating neuronal injury. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the
relationship between cellular stress and alterations in the nuclear pore complex in C9orf72 ALS/FTD.
Determining the contribution of stress granules to dysfunctional nucleocytoplasmic transport will uncover novel
approaches to therapeutic interventions for repairing the nuclear pore complex. In summary, understanding the
connection between disease pathomechanisms and the neuronal subtype-specific effects of the C9orf72
repeat expansion on the nuclear pore complex, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and gene expression are
essential to our understanding of C9orf72 ALS/FTD pathogenesis."
10854478,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal requests support for the purchase of a Becton-Dickenson (BD) FACS Melody cell
sorter. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorters (FACS) sort through heterogeneous suspensions of
cells, typically obtained from enzymatic digestion of intact tissue or organs. The suspension of
cells is distributed into separate pools of homogeneous cells, based on their expression of
fluorescent proteins or their labeling with fluorescent antibodies directed at cell type-specific
proteins. FACS analysis is critically important for cancer biology, immunology, developmental
biology, heart, lung and blood studies, genetics, and other biomedical disciplines that involve the
analysis of cell type-specific responses that cannot be studied using tissue homogenates. The
instrument will be secured in a shared equipment core facility managed and supported by the
Stanley Manne Children’s Research Institute (SMCRI) at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s
Hospital of Chicago. Full time on-site technical experts in the core facility will train new users,
oversee the maintenance and calibration of the instrument, and provide user support during
normal business hours. The SMCRI will purchase a service contract for years 2-5, after the 1-
year warranty has ended, assuring long-term continued operation. Competitive recharge fees
will be charged to users, and used to support the purchase of supplies and service contracts.
The instrument will be used by eleven NIH-funded investigators (4 Major and 7 Minor) funded by
18 NIH awards within the SMCRI, as well as by junior faculty and trainees seeking to obtain NIH
funding. The SMCRI does not currently own a FACS analyzer, forcing its investigators to
compete for time on heavily subscribed instruments at neighboring institutions in Chicago.
Prioritized access to this instrument will therefore accelerate productivity of NIH-funded projects.
The highly automated functionality of this BD FACS Melody system will shorten the required
daily set-up time compared with older technologies, and also shorten the time required for
investigator training. These features will lower the costs to investigators and promote the
training of lab members and trainees. Finally, an Advisory Committee will oversee the operation
of the shared instrument, resolve any disputes that might arise with investigators, and assure
that the PI files the required reports to NIH in a timely manner."
10853227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current standard tri-modality therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) for locally advanced rectal cancer
is associated with high morbidity and only cures disease in about 75% of patients. We hypothesize that a
biomarker-driven approach that gives matched targeted therapy to patients early in the treatment of locally
advanced rectal cancers will lead to high anti-tumor activity and provide the chance to avoid radiation and/or
surgery and its associated morbidities. We have already pioneered such an approach for mismatch repair
deficient locally advanced rectal cancer, where clinical complete response was seen in all patients who
completed 6 months of upfront treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (23/23, 100% complete clinical
response), allowing for the omission of radiation and/or surgery. In this proposal, we focus on patients with
HER2-amplified rectal cancer and hypothesize that induction therapy with HER2-targeted treatment will lead to
tumor regression and modify the need for tri-modality therapy. We propose an investigator-initiated phase II
study (NCT05672524; MSK IRB# 22-185) that recently opened to enrollment; all patients will receive tucatinib
plus trastuzumab induction HER2-targeted therapy for 6 weeks and continue tucatinib plus trastuzumab with
addition of standard-of-care chemotherapy for 4 months, followed by disease reassessment before standard
chemoradiation and before surgery. Patients with clinical complete response to induction HER2 therapy alone
or combined with chemotherapy, or to the combination followed by chemoradiation, will undergo observation
with a chance for an organ-sparing management approach. Our central hypothesis is that the primary tumor will
be highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, leading to a
higher frequency of clinical complete response than with standard total neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment of rectal
cancer in patients provides the unique opportunity to obtain on-treatment longitudinal tumor and blood samples
to evaluate mechanisms of response and resistance. We hypothesize that levels of HER2 expression and
consequent dependence on HER2 homodimers underlie drug response and will determine HER2 expression in
biopsy samples and with 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/MRI and correlate with response rate and progression-free
survival. Circulating tumor DNA will be tested as a biomarker for response. Established and newly generated
patient-derived HER2-amplified colorectal cancer organoids will be used to model and study acquired resistance,
taking advantage of our team's expertise in generating these three-dimensional, multi-cellular structures, which
both recapitulate the biology of rectal cancer and provide a needed resource that expands the limited HER2-
amplified rectal cancer models currently available. We hypothesize that key resistance mechanisms will consist
of decreased HER2 expression, secondary alterations that activate ERK, and shifts in tumor transcriptional
programs. Together, we will define the efficacy and biological effects of biomarker-directed therapy and aim to
transform treatment for patients with HER2-amplified locally advanced rectal cancer."
10853298,"Mechanistic properties of circadian rhythms and sleep are conserved between insects and mammals. In both
taxonomic groups, brain astrocytes cooperate with neurons to modulate sleep and circadian behavior 1-7.
However, neither the astrocyte subtypes regulating rhythmicity nor mechanisms for reciprocal communication
with neurons are well understood. In this application, we propose to address these important gaps in our
understanding of reciprocal astrocyte-neuron communication and how it influences sleep and activity rhythms.
To begin to define relevant mechanisms, we have employed Drosophila enhancer-Gal4 transgenic strains with
expression in specific astrocyte subpopulations to conditionally manipulate adult fly astrocytes to identify
subpopulations that modulate sleep or circadian behavior. Preliminary results for this application demonstrate
that activation or inhibition of different astrocyte subpopulations can alter circadian activity cycles and sleep,
with selective effects on nighttime sleep. The observation that fly astrocytes exert modulatory effects primarily
in the night is similar to the nighttime role of mammalian astrocytes in regulating circadian behavior 3. It also
highlights the importance of this cell class in regulating deep and homeostatically-controlled sleep, which
occurs predominantly in the night 8. Our proposal will test specific hypotheses concerning communication
between astrocytes and neurons with an emphasis on understanding how such communication modulates
sleep and activity cycles. Aim 1 of this application will employ methods to activate or inhibit astrocytes to test
the hypothesis that distinct astrocyte subpopulations and particular signaling molecules modulate specific
properties of sleep and circadian behavior. This aim will also utilize genetic methods to visualize connections
between astrocyte and neuronal processes to identify potentially communicating cell types. Aim 2 will employ
genetic cell activation techniques in live brains together with genetic reporters of neural excitation and second
messenger signaling to define mechanisms of reciprocal communication between specific astrocyte
subpopulations and neurons regulating sleep or circadian rhythms. This aim will test hypotheses about roles
for specific astrocyte signaling molecules in regulating the physiology of the relevant neuron classes. Aim 3 will
utilize genome-wide transcriptome profiling methods and behavioral protocols to identify intracellular pathways
and signaling molecules required for normal sleep or circadian behavior.
Given the conservation of molecular and neuronal mechanisms controlling sleep and circadian behavior in flies
and humans, our proposed studies have relevance for understanding roles of neuron-glia communication in
neural development, normal brain function, and the behavioral/neurological diseases that are known to result
from abnormal neuron-glia communication 9,10."

A defect in DNA damage repair triggers genome instability as a hallmark of cancer that is exploited by treatments
such as ionizing radiation, platinum chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).
Pathogenic germline and somatic variants in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 are frequently detected in triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) and BRCA1-mutated TNBC can be targeted with PARPi to achieve a clinical
response. Elucidating the mechanism(s) by which BRCA1 and its associated partners resolve DNA lesions will
provide new insights into how genome instability promotes cellular transformation and identify new therapeutic
targets. In this proposal, we will investigate functions of the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis in R-loop associated DNA
damage to sustain stable genome. Persistent and unscheduled R-loops create structural barriers when they
collide with collapsed replication forks or double strand breaks (DSB) to elicit genome instability. Our preliminary
data found that METTL3, a protein promoting RNA m6A modification when R-loops form during transcription, is
recruited to repair DNA lesions at active transcription sites. METTL3 is phosphorylated by ATR, a key kinase in
R-loop associated DNA damage signaling, and this phosphorylation promotes association with BRCA1. We
found that BRCA1 is both necessary and sufficient for METTL3 recruitment to DNA damage sites. We identified
several breast cancer associated METTL3 mutations and found that two catalytically inactive mutations impede
HR repair by abolishing the association with BRCA1. Our proteomic analysis has identified a DNA/RNA helicase
that resolves R-loops as the effector of the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis. Furthermore, inhibition of METTL3
catalytic activity with a small molecule induces a defect in homologous recombination and enhances PARPi
sensitivity in TNBC cell lines. We hypothesize that the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis is critical for the R-loop-
associated DNA damage repair and breast cancer development and offers a new therapeutic target for TNBC.
We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms by which
METTL3 Serine 43 phosphorylation promotes DNA/RNA helicase recruitment to resolve R-loop associated DNA
damage. In Aim 2, we will determine the roles of the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis in breast cancer development
with mouse models. In Aim 3, we will target the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis with a METTL3 inhibitor in TNBC.
Our studies will unravel a novel function for METTL3 in DNA repair and identify METTL3 as a promising
therapeutic target in TNBC."

 Clostridioides difficile is an anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the gut of patients treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics. A challenge in treating C. difficile infection (CDI) is the production of spores that
germinate to active vegetative cells in response to host bile acids. The normal gut microflora typically prevents
colonization of C. difficile. Gut microflora dysbiosis as a consequence of treatment with broad-spectrum
antibiotics causes recurrence of CDI in 25% of patients, for which spore germination is an instigator. There are
no antibiotics for the treatment of multiple recurrent CDI, leading to 11,500 annual deaths in the United States.
CDI is the deadliest of the five bacterial urgent threats. Understanding the process of spore germination is key
to elucidating the basis for recurrent CDI. If spore germination could be prevented, the nefarious cycles of CDI
can be interrupted. We disclose the discovery of the oxadiazoles with bactericidal activity against C. difficile
vegetative cells, of which certain oxadiazoles also inhibit spore germination. This grant proposal is outlined in
three Specific Aims. We disclose our efforts in elucidation of the details of the spore-germination pathway
(Specific Aim 1). We have proposed experiments to demonstrate that inhibition of spore germination is at the
root of recurrence of CDI (Specific Aim 2). Furthermore, we outline our efforts to intervene pharmacologically in
recurrent CDI by inhibition of spore germination (Specific Aim 3)."

This proposal requests funding for the purchase of a Bruker timsTOF HT mass spectrometer (timsHT MS) coupled
with an Evosep One HPLC in order to meet the increasing demand for high-performance proteomics instrumentation
at Rutgers University Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS)-Newark Campus. The Center for Advanced
Proteomics Research (CAPR) at RBHS-New Jersey Medical School in Newark will benefit from this instrument,
enhancing service quality. With ever-increasing service needs from NIH-funded researchers, the existing Lumos
Orbitrap MS has been exhausted, resulting in a long delay for large-scale proteomics studies. This wait time impedes
the progress of NIH-funded investigations. Therefore, adding a timsHT MS at CAPR will speed up the research
momentum of Rutgers' NIH-supported researchers.
Experienced CAPR scientists will operate the new timsHT MS to conduct wide-scale proteomics studies for a major
user group of 15 NIH-funded researchers and others. These investigations aim to analyze more samples quickly and
identify more low-abundant proteins, post-translational modifications, and their positional isomers. To achieve
these objectives, a high-end MS that can offer sensitivity, speed, and time-saving technology to distinguish isobaric
peptides and robustness for boosting instrument uptime. The timsHT MS has a unique blend of engineering and
software functionalities that will enable sensitive proteomics studies to meet three unmet needs. Firstly, deep
proteome coverage will be achieved through dual Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS), which facilitates ~30-
fold time-focusing of low-level peptide ions, and software that is aware of collision cross-section for in-depth
peptide identification and quantification. Secondly, high sensitivity without compromise on speed and resolution
will be achieved through Parallel Accumulation - Serial Fragmentation technology, which facilitates MS/MS
acquisition at 150 Hz, enabling speedy studies of moderate-level samples with short LC gradients. Thirdly,
instrument uptime and robustness will be maximized through an orthogonally positioned ion source to cut
impurities in the mass analyzer, a dual-TIMS funnel to filter contaminating gas, and an improved focus on low-level
peptide ions.
The NIH-funded purchase of this shared timsHT MS will empower CAPR to overcome the time limitations of existing
equipment and offer complementary MS technologies to support RBHS-Newark researchers and those from
neighboring institutions in carrying out their research goals on NIH-funded grants."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major healthcare problem that affects over 20 million Americans and costs
an estimated $82.8 billion each year. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB) is a related epidemic that is estimated to affect 12
million Americans by 2030 with costs of ~$26 billion each year. Up to 38% of AFIB patients also have CAD and
they have a worse prognosis than patients with CAD alone. In order to prioritize and treat this vulnerable
population, clinicians need clear diagnostic tools that point toward specific treatments. Computed Tomography
Angiography (CTA) can be used to detect anatomical blockages in the coronaries; however, the hemodynamic
significance of the blockage cannot be accurately determined. Myocardial perfusion imaging is a proven tool to
detect and characterize CAD by determining the hemodynamic significance of coronary blockages on the
myocardium. While Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging is widely used
in the U.S., the specificity of SPECT is low in patients with AFIB and CAD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
perfusion imaging is less widely available for CAD assessment but offers quantitative myocardial blood flow
maps and has superior image resolution compared to SPECT. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers
myocardial perfusion imaging with in-plane spatial resolution superior to PET imaging and without the ionizing
radiation. However, MR imaging has a few limitations in the context of AFIB patients, (1) MRI relies on good
and consistent ECG-gating signals to achieve diagnostic quality images. AFIB patients’ inconsistent R-R
intervals result in poor image quality with randomly changing cardiac phases for a given slice and hence are
often excluded from MR studies. (2) Quantifying MR perfusion images requires accurate measurement of the
arterial input function with a high temporal sampling rate, something challenging in AFIB patients due to changing
R-R intervals. (3) MR perfusion has limited slice coverage compared to SPECT and PET and is exacerbated in
AFIB patients. Increased slice coverage is desirable for improved confidence and accuracy in perfusion defect
assessment. A myocardial perfusion MRI method that (i) does not rely on ECG gating, (ii) has whole-heart
coverage and (iii) is quantitative would be extremely valuable in AFIB patients to detect CAD. Specific aims of
the project are (I) to develop a flow and motion insensitive steady-state (FAMISS) ungated quantitative
simultaneous multi-slice acquisition methods along with novel constrained and deep learning reconstruction
techniques for rapid, whole-heart quantitative perfusion MRI, (II) to rigorously compare the quantitative flow
values from the FAMISS framework with existing dual-bolus quantitative MRI measures, and (III) to validate the
FAMISS framework by comparing it to the gold standard for quantification, PET imaging, and the gold standard
for diagnostic accuracy using invasive fractional flow measures. Our team and institution have deep cardiac MRI
and PET experience and the technology needed to successfully execute all aspects of this project. The success
of our project will deliver a game-changing MRI technology for AFIB patients with suspected CAD."

faced with the health disparity of high anal cancer/dysplasia rates. Despite the increased risk and incidence,
personal barriers related perception, stigma, access to care, fear, and anxiety of anal disease result in a health
disparity gap. It is known the human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent for anal cancer/dysplasia but
many PLWH are not vaccinated and there is limited data on its efficacy and effectiveness in PLWH. The health
disparity is further compounded by the racial/cultural diversity of PLWH in Hawaii. This project seeks to
address this health disparity gap that is experienced by Hawaii’s PLWH by understanding uptake barriers,
improving their understanding of possible HPV vaccination benefits, and to determine the vaccine’s efficacy
and effectiveness in this unique population. We propose to determine uptake following healthcare provider
promotion and determine clinical outcomes in Hawaii’s PLWH. Our central hypotheses are that Hawaii’s PLWH
experience a spectrum of barriers that impact HPV vaccination uptake but HPV vaccine promotion by a
healthcare provider can increase awareness and increase uptake. Further, measurement of HPV antibody
levels will be correlated with clinical outcomes. The significance is to generate critical knowledge which will
improve vaccination rates in PLWH in Hawaii and thus reduce the anal cancer/dysplasia health disparity
observed in this population which may contribute to the increased anal cancer/dysplasia rates and gain a
better understanding of the immune response from the vaccine. The objective is to gain a better
understanding of HPV uptake barriers, which is essential to promotion and increasing knowledge and
awareness. We propose: 1) To identify personal barriers faced by Hawaii’s PLWH that impact HPV vaccination
uptake and 2) To measure clinical outcomes of the HPV vaccine in Hawaii’s PLWH."

 Approximately 30 million (~9%) of all people in the US have type 2 diabetes (T2DM),1 and this number is
expected to continue to rise.2 At the same time, 15 million (11.8%) US households experience food insecurity,3
defined as lack of access to adequate amounts of healthy food. T2DM and food insecurity are strongly related
for U.S. adults: Very low food security is associated with an over 100% increase in T2DM prevalence
compared with adults from high food-secure households.4 Residents of rural areas are particularly threatened
by the intersection of food insecurity and T2DM. Food insecurity prevalence in rural areas is 1.2 times higher
than in metropolitan areas.6 T2DM prevalence in rural areas is 17% higher than in metropolitan areas.7 Recent
studies have shown promise for improving health indicators for food insecure people with T2DM. These studies
have tested interventions distributing healthy food and shown preliminary indications of success for improving
glycemic control, diabetes distress, self-reported diabetes management, and food security.22-24,29 We will test
this approach for the first time in rural areas in a way that both promotes participant adherence and is scalable:
we will employ home-delivery of T2DM-appropriate food boxes with evidence based-educational materials and
recipes to improve glycemic control and diet quality of rural food insecure patients with T2DM. This intervention
adopts a health equity framework:30,31 it addresses specific needs and barriers of rural food insecure
households at risk for many health and economic disparities. Our long-term goal is to transform rural residents'
management of T2DM.This study's objective is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention that is
scalable and sustainable and promotes patient adherence by mitigating rural food insecure participants'
difficulties associated with completing existing interventions. Our specific aims are: 1. Compare the
effectiveness of the Healthy Food Delivery Intervention (HFDI) plus standard care and standard care alone to
improve diabetes-related outcomes among rural food insecure patients with T2DM. 2. Compare the
effectiveness of the HFDI plus standard care and standard care alone to improve diet quality among rural food
insecure patients with T2DM. 3. Compare cost-effectiveness to understand HFDI plus standard care costs in
relationship to outcomes in relation to standard care alone. We will conduct a fully-powered, comparative
effectiveness RCT that includes 400 food insecure patients with T2DM. These patients will be recruited from
clinics serving rural populations. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the HFDI plus standard care or
standard care alone, with 200 in each arm. Baseline and follow up data (post-intervention, six months post-
intervention, and 12 months post-intervention) will be collected from patients in both study arms. The Healthy
Food Delivery intervention (HFDI) outcomes and findings will be applicable to vulnerable rural populations.
This proposal directly addresses NIH funding priorities related to food insecurity.32"

Despite a substantial reduction in the incidence and deaths related to malaria in sub-Sahara Africa, the region
still carries a disproportionate share of the global burden of malaria. The overall goal of this ICEMR program is
to understand the persistence of malaria in the context of the wide deployment of control interventions and
provide evidence-based approaches for developing optimal combinations of control strategies for interrupting
residual malaria transmission. We will characterize critical barriers related to changing epidemiological patterns
and drug and insecticide resistance to develop contextually tailored interventions to address the evolving needs
of malaria control programs. This ICEMR encompasses 3 Projects with the goals summarized as follows: 1]
Epidemiology Project (Project 1): the goal is to investigate the residual malaria transmission to develop and
evaluate optimal control strategies at study sites in Mali, representing different eco-zones across West Africa,
2]Malaria immuno-genetics Project (Project 2): The goal of this project is to study factors associated with
gametocytogenesis in symptomatic and asymptomatic disease and their contributions to transmission in low
transmission season setting (parasite and human genetics, immune response, and transmissibility) in relation
with malaria control interventions in Mali, 3] Malaria vector and transmission field ecology project (Project 3):
will characterize low residual transmission studying malaria vector populations and ecology in the continuum
rural-urban and peri-urban setting of Bamako, Mali. These projects link the different aspects of malaria
transmission and disease into a unified whole, adding the ability to distinguish the contributions of different
malaria control interventions on parasite population and range of immune responses (Project 2,
Immunopathogenesis) and seasonal and geographical distribution of anopheline mosquitoes vectors (Project 3).
Understanding the factors relating entomological with epidemiological transmission patterns will provide more
appropriate guidelines for malaria control tailored to different ecological settings in Mali and West Africa."

through emergent diagnostic and translational systems biology platforms to address emerging
issues viz. asymptomatic malaria and non-falciparum malaria transmission in the context of
malaria elimination and eradication (MEE).
ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Progress toward the global target set out in the WHO Global Technical Strategy for malaria 2016-2030 to reduce
malaria case incidence and mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030― against a 2015 baseline— has stalled. A
significant challenge to effectively identifying and treating malaria infection is targeting asymptomatic cases –
important parasite reservoirs contributing to sustained transmission. Substantial emphasis needs to be placed
on identifying subclinical P. falciparum (Pf) infection to reach global elimination goals, especially considering
difficulties that are arising from increasing failure rates of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) – and thus increasing
false-positive rates – for PfHRP2-based RDTs due to strains with pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, as well as a
considerable lack of sensitive field-deployable diagnostic tools for non-falciparum malaria (NFM), which includes
P. vivax (Pv), P. ovale curtisi (Poc), P. ovale wallikeri (Pow), and P. malariae (Pm). To better understand the
epidemiological factors contributing to subclinical Pf and/or NFM infections and their role in residual malaria
transmission, Plasmodium species detection is paramount, as it can influence treatment regimens and potentially
guide control and intervention policy. While malaria RDTs and the ‘gold standard’ light microscopy remain
important, the requirement to quantify the subclinical parasite reservoir alongside the detection of key mutations
necessitates the use of molecular methods. Going beyond the molecular approach, other ‘omics’ approaches
may be more powerful in providing new insight into malaria transmission biology. The overarching hypothesis to
be explored in PP3 is to investigate the use of innovative tailored multiomics solutions to address the
considerable challenge of accurately detecting and diagnosing subclinical Pf and NFM infections. Leveraging
our existing bank of saliva, whole blood, dried blood spots, and liquid blood spots, the project will seek to test,
define, and validate a suite of novel diagnostic tests to detect, quantify and characterize asymptomatic Pf
infection and NFM. T
his Émergents ICEMR program project seeks to: Aim PP3.1. Implementation of non-
invasive rapid tests for identifying individuals (adults and children) and thereby quantifying the parasite
reservoir in the human population contributing to residual transmission; Aim PP3.2. Developing and
validating a quantitative dried blood spot into direct, no extraction qPCR diagnostic platform for Pf, Pv,
Po(w), Po(c), and Pm; and Aim PP.3.3. Dissecting the biology of asymptomatic Pf, NFM and mixed
infections viz. malaria transmission. Key outcomes of PP3 will be to generate prevalence data for subclinical
Pf infections in Nigeria through retrospective analyses of saliva samples using the SMAART-1 lateral flow test,
develop a rapid cost-effective process of molecularly screening for Plasmodium infection in qDBS from clinical
samples, and collected mosquito samples, and establish a novel, deployable lipidomic analytical platforms for
interrogating human host profiles that facilitate NFM transmission, as well as assessing species, insecticide
resistance and infection status."
10835921,"Huntington’s disease (HD), one of the first neurodegenerative diseases for which a genetic cause
was determined, is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that has no disease-modifying
treatment. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene encoding a polyglutamine
(polyQ) tract within the amino terminal portion of Huntingtin (HTT). While the field has gained an
understanding of the many cellular processes that are disrupted in HD, we do not yet understand
the interplay between key proximal HD-associated events, such as the relationship between
aberrant mutant HTT (mHTT) accumulation, RNA biology and epigenetic events in specific cell
types in the brain. Similarly, we do not know how changes in these processes impact clinical
manifestation of disease, where best to intervene therapeutically and what outcome measures
may be the most informative in HD models. The overarching focus of the research proposed here
is to fill vital gaps in our knowledge about how these factors impact onset and progression of HD
and how that understanding might lead to new disease-altering therapies. The proposed research
will leverage unique resources and methods developed in my lab and those of my collaborators
and will utilize state-of-the-art technologies such as single-cell RNA-seq, mass spectrometry and
cryo-electron tomography to dissect molecular mechanisms. Ultimately, treatments for this
disease, including combination therapies, will likely require a much better fundamental
understanding of how mHTT leads to HD pathology and death. Our recent data suggests
unexpected relationships between protein posttranslational modification (PTM) pathways,
aberrant mutant HTT accumulation and DNA damage responses in neurons, the latter now
implicated as a critical modifier of HD age-of-onset. Using a systems biology approach we are
learning how chronic expression and accumulation of mHTT impacts gene expression and now
seek to develop a more comprehensive understanding of RNA biology and causal networks in
specific cell types. Here I propose investigations aimed at addressing major gaps in our
understanding of how the fundamental molecular and cellular events underlie how the mutant HD
gene causes degeneration of specific cell populations in the brain to induce motor and cognitive
decline and ultimately premature death of patients. My program benefits from the integrated use
of patient iPSCs and HD mouse models and the extensive and productive collaborations we have
established over many years. With the overall goal of understanding proximal and initiating events
in the disease and developing therapies for HD, I propose two primary avenues of research
relating to the integration of 1) protein homeostasis and 2) epigenetics and RNA biology in HD."

Obesity is among the most prevalent and costly conditions in the United States. To face this pivotal public
health challenge, there is a need for ground-breaking research aimed at explicating modifiable factors
associated with the development of obesity to inform interventions. Studies aimed at elucidating neural
vulnerability factors for obesity – including high food reward sensitivity and poor food regulation – hold
particular promise. However, relatively little is known about the modifiable factors that contribute to these
neural vulnerabilities, thus precluding the development of potentially powerful interventions to promote healthy
long-term weight trajectories. Further, the limited research in this area lacks critical developmental and
environmental context. The current proposal addresses these gaps by examining the roles of selected
modifiable cognitive (executive control), behavioral (diet, sleep), affective (negative affect), and environmental
(obesogenic environment) factors throughout childhood and adolescence in predicting emerging neural
vulnerabilities for obesity during the pivotal transition to young adulthood. The study leverages rich data from a
unique existing longitudinal study spanning preschool through adolescence, and adds new data collection
using functional neuroimaging paradigms to assess neural vulnerability factors for obesity in young adulthood.
The long-term goal is to inform novel interventions targeting key modifiable factors during childhood and
adolescence to reduce long-term obesity risk. The objective of the proposed research, therefore, is to elucidate
the impact of theoretically-relevant cognitive, behavioral, affective, and environmental factors on emerging
neural vulnerability factors in the context of a longitudinal study spanning preschool to young adulthood. The
central hypothesis is that emerging neural vulnerabilities for obesity are significantly influenced by a
multidimensional set of modifiable factors in childhood and adolescence. The specific aims are to: 1)
Determine the impact of executive control development across childhood and adolescence on food reward
sensitivity and regulation in young adulthood; 2) Determine the impact of a set of behavioral and affective
factors in adolescence (i.e., diet, sleep, negative affect) on food reward sensitivity and regulation in young
adulthood; and 3) Explore the impact of the obesogenic environment encountered in adolescence on food
reward sensitivity and regulation in young adulthood. The project is innovative in its unique leveraging of
rigorous existing longitudinal data; cutting-edge neuroimaging paradigms; and novel attention to the interplay
between brain, environment, behavior, and health. The significance of this research is that it will yield
unprecedented insight into modifiable factors that contribute to neural vulnerabilities for obesity, all within rich
developmental and environmental context. These insights will inform novel obesity interventions targeting
critical individual and environmental factors at key points in development to reduce long-term obesity risk."

Currently there are no effective treatments that can cure metastatic breast cancer. The epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical cancer cell plasticity and dedifferentiation program by which epithelial
cells acquire pro-migratory and invasive mesenchymal properties. To initiate the EMT program, cancer cells
need to receive pro-EMT signals, such as TGF from either neighboring tumor cells or from the
microenvironment (surrounding stroma).
 Our research group made the unexpected finding that during TGFβ mediated EMT, Pol I rDNA transcription
is: (1) driven by Snail, a transcription factor known to play a central role in orchestrating the mesenchymal Pol II
dependent gene expression program required for cellular invasiveness and metastatic spread; (2) a concurrent
loss of Myc occurs at rDNA genes; and (3) Snail forms a complex with METTL5 to enable that the newly made
rRNA are m6A modified by METTL5 before the rRNA is incorporated into the mature ribosome; (4) Snail also
forms a complex with METTL3 and may therefore direct m6A modifications of selective mRNAs; (5) the m6A
marked mRNAs enables recruitment of the non-canonical DAP5/eIF3d/METTL3 translation complex to drive
selective m6A marked mRNA translation in the mesenchymal state; and (6) METTL5 is required for execution of
the EMT program, as silencing of METTL5 prevents cells from undergoing EMT.
The focus of this grant application is to gain a deeper molecular understanding of Pol I rDNA
transcription, METTL5 m6A modified rRNA and ribosomes and why selective DAP5/eIF3d mediated
translational control is essential for orchestrating breast cancer cell plasticity in EMT, its role in breast
cancer metastatic progression, and how Snail orchestrates and coordinates the m6A rRNA/mRNA axis.
This knowledge will ultimately inform how targeting Pol I machinery, specialized ribosomes and translation
control could represent a novel therapy specifically targeting the plastic, non-proliferating and chemo-resistant
EMT cells fueling tumor reoccurrence and metastasis."
10836040,"The gut microbiome is key for proper human development and for maintenance of health. However,
microbiome integrity can be severely impacted by consumption of antimicrobial xenobiotics that target some of
its microbial members. Such selection pressure can trigger shifts in its species composition and ultimately
culminate in microbiome dysbiosis that is detrimental to health. Recent drug screens revealed that a quarter of
host-targeted drugs, that are not prescribed as antibiotics, have potent antimicrobial activity at physiological
concentrations. Yet, while the bacterial toxicity of many host-targeted drugs is widely appreciated, the targets
of these drugs in bacterial cells remain mostly unknown. Given the scale of this phenomenon, involving
hundreds of widely prescribed drugs, there is a critical need to develop a high-throughput approach for
identifying the pathways and processes underlying bacterial toxicity. Such systematic understanding will reveal
which host-targeted drugs resemble known categories of antibiotic drugs and if prolonged treatment can
unintentionally contribute to multi-drug antibiotic resistance. Moreover, classification of host-targeted drugs by
mechanism of bacterial toxicity can uncover potentially new targets for by yet-to-be developed antibiotics.
Our overall goal is to investigate the bacterial pathways and processes underlying the toxicity of host-targeted
drugs and reveal the mechanisms that can propel evolved resistance against them. We will use Escherichia
coli as a model system and will leverage on a pooled genetic screening approach we developed to map all
single-gene knockouts that modulate toxicity across multiple drugs. We will screen 117 host-targeted drugs
that we already identified as inhibitory for E. coli and a complementary set of 142 standard antibiotics (with
known targets). Taken together, these systematic measurements of drug sensitivity (3,680 knockout strains X
269 drugs) will allow us to computationally infer a network graph mapping drug-drug resemblance by profiles of
knockout strain sensitivity. This network will be used to annotate the bacterial targets of host-targeted drugs by
both the identity of screen hits and by the drug similarity to well-annotated antibiotics. We will complement the
screen with lab evolution experiments and will identify the resistance mechanisms that emerge under drug
selection. This approach will expand our mechanistic understanding of drug targets by uncovering additional
resistance mechanisms against the same drugs (e.g., gain-of-function mutations). Lastly, we will investigate
collateral drug resistance in evolved strains and natural E. coli isolates and will evaluate if adaptation to host-
targeted drugs poses a risk by unintentionally selecting for multi-drug and antibiotics resistance. The proposed
work will, for the first time, systematically map the mechanisms underlying bacterial sensitivity to host-targeted
drugs and will uncover if chronic administration of specific host-targeted drugs increases the likelihood for
emergence of cross-resistance against specific antibiotics or multi-drug resistance."

Chemokines control the migration and localization of leukocytes and play fundamental roles in regulating
immune and inflammatory responses. One such chemokine, CXCL12, promotes multiple steps in the growth of
many primary tumors and progression to metastasis by binding to C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)
and atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), which are upregulated in many cancers. Unlike most G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs), CXCL12-bound ACKR3 signals only via arrestins. In response to CXCL12,
ACKR3 is phosphorylated by intracellular GPCR kinases (GRKs) which subsequently recruit arrestins. The
arrestins serve as scaffolds that promotes growth pathways critical for cell survival, proliferation, and migration.
Arrestins also drive receptor internalization, during which CXCL12 is trafficked to lysosomes and degraded.
Afterwards, the empty receptor is recycled to the cell surface where it maintains a relatively stable
concentration. This process results in the ""scavenging"" or uptake of CXCL12 from the extracellular space and
is important for maintaining the responsiveness of CXCR4-expressing cells in the context of normal physiology
as well as tumor metastasis. In this proposal, the Tesmer and Handel labs, with deep expertise in GRKs and
chemokine receptor structure and function, respectively, join forces to better understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying ACKR3 phosphorylation by different GRKs, how arrestins interact with the resulting
phosphorylation “barcodes” installed in the C-terminus of the receptor, and what the cellular consequences
are. They have discovered that GRK2 and GRK5 phosphorylate activated ACKR3 at distinct regions of its
cytoplasmic tail. Moreover, phosphorylation enhances binding to both arrestin2 and 3. Arrestin2 recruitment
has not been reported before, and thus its functional significance remains to be elucidated. They have further
isolated complexes of ACKR3 with both arrestin as well as with GRK2–Gthat are of suitable quality for high
resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions and have shown that G subunits alone can
form a strong interaction with ACKR3 of unknown function. In Aim1, cryo-EM structures of CXCL12-activated
ACKR3 will be determined in complex with various GRKs, with focus on GRK2, and with G. In Aim2, cryo-
EM will be used to examine arrestin complexes with phosphorylated ACKR3. In Aim 3, hypothesis driven cell-
based assays of ACKR3 function and unbiased mass spectrometry approaches will be used to systematically
investigate mechanisms by which these proteins control arrestin-mediated signaling and scavenging by
ACKR3 and determine if there is specific GRK and arrestin isoform control of ACKR3 function. The successful
conclusion of this proposal will result in the first structure of an atypical chemokine receptor in complex with its
intracellular signaling partners as well as unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of a
therapeutically important receptor that may ultimately aid in the development of new cancer treatments."
10854925,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amidst the current opioid overdose crisis, 1.4 million women of reproductive age report non-medical opioid
use, and opioid use disorder (OUD) prevalence among pregnant women rose five-fold from 1998-2017.
Although pregnancy may be a motivating time to start medications to treat OUD, retention post-partum
declines significantly and is associated with unacceptably high opioid overdose and mortality rates. Injection
drug use is also the primary risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States (U.S.). Women
now comprise nearly half of new HCV infections, and HCV seroprevalence has also risen five-fold in pregnant
women since 2000. Although the U.S. is committed to eliminating HCV, about 50% of people are unaware of
their infection and fewer than 40% of those diagnosed have been treated. Research is needed to identify
venues to increase efforts to improve OUD treatment and retention and to identify and treat current
HCV infection. Perinatal care provides longitudinal access to women over a nearly one-year period,
and as pregnancy may be a motivating time for women to seek care for both OUD and HCV, perinatal
care may be a critical venue to reach women who inject drugs, a key population that NIDA identifies as
central to the ongoing opioid crisis. Yet, little data exist to measure the role of the perinatal care venue to
reach national OUD and HCV treatment goals. This study aims to create a perinatal-specific decision model
and measure health service utilization and costs of a perinatal OUD and HCV intervention to identify how to
leverage the perinatal care venue to decrease postpartum opioid overdoses and population-level HCV
transmission. This study has two main aims: (1) to build a microsimulation model to analyze the clinical and
health economic effects of leveraging the perinatal care venue to reduce opioid overdoses and population-level
and infant HCV transmission; (2) to measure health services utilization and costs of incorporating MOUD and
HCV treatment into perinatal care. The results of this study could help determine most efficient resource
allocation to achieve national overdose and HCV elimination goals. The PI, Dr. Epstein, is an early career
investigator, trained in pediatric and adult infectious diseases, with a focus on addiction medicine and HCV in
pregnant women and youth. This career development award will allow her to gain expertise in 1) transmission
modeling and model calibration and 2) health economic evaluation and micro-costing to be able to conduct
comparative cost-effectiveness research to inform interventions for women with substance use and HCV. She
has compiled an experienced team of mentors and advisors to help her achieve her training and career goals,
to become an independent clinician-investigator expert in utilizing decision science to project most effective
use of resources to improve care for families at the center of the opioid overdose, HCV and HIV epidemics."

 Functional gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are the most common diagnoses in gastroenterology. Such
disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia, are recognized by altered GI sensitivity and
motility. Though the pathophysiology is complex, a conserved feature is the bidirectional alteration in brain-
gut signaling. Thus, these are classified as disorders of brain-gut interaction. While the vagus nerve is the
main brain-gut link, how the brain relays neural signals that modulate GI epithelial sensory function is
unknown. My long-term career goal is to document how neural circuits originating from the brain alter the
gut’s ability to sense nutrients. With the support of the NIH Mentored Research Scientist Development
Award — K01, the objective of this proposal is to delineate a brain-to-gut neural circuit that could be used to
alter sensory transduction at the gut epithelium. This will be accomplished in three aims:
 Aim 1. Determine the neurotransmitters and hormones released by intestinal sensory cells in
response to excitatory neurotransmitter stimulation. An in vitro organoid and sorted single cell assay will be
used to measure release in culture. This aim will demonstrate that an excitatory neurotransmitter can
stimulate vesicular release in enteroendocrine cells.
 Aim 2. Pair vagal stimulation with sensory epithelial cell calcium imaging and electrophysiology to
evaluate the functional connectivity of vagal neurons synapsing onto intestinal sensory cells. This aim will
demonstrate a functional connection where neurons increase the excitability of sensory cells in the proximal
small intestine.
 Aim 3. Utilize both retrograde (post- to pre-synapse) rabies virus and anterograde (pre- to post-
synapse) herpes simplex virus to trace a mono-synaptic connection between the brainstem and intestinal
sensory epithelial cells. This aim will establish an anatomical map for how the brainstem is connected to
neuropod cells.
 Identifying functional neural circuits connecting the brain and the gut will enable the understanding of
the mechanisms behind visceral hypersensitivity. Together with my mentoring team, we have designed this
project to provide me with the necessary research and professional training for me to excel as an
independent investigator in the field of sensory neurogastroenterology."
10854963,"Project Summary:
 Vaccination is one of the most successful innovations in the fight against infectious disease. However, we
still lack effective and safe vaccines against many major infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, tuberculosis, and
malaria). We also lack a comprehensive and interoperable vaccine knowledgebase to accelerate vaccine
development and better understand vaccine safety. Based on the preliminary version of our current VIOLIN
vaccine knowledgebase, we propose to develop VIOLIN 2.0, a new generation Vaccine Information and
Ontology LInked kNowledgebase.
Strong preliminary data were generated: Originally funded by an NIH-NIAID R01, our VIOLIN has grown
to include information on >4,000 vaccines for >200 pathogens. In addition, we have led the development of the
community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) for vaccine and adverse
event representation. We have also developed the widely used Vaxign and Vaxign-ML vaccine design
programs and applied them to predict vaccines for many diseases including COVID-19. Many ontology- and
bioinformatics-based methods and tools, including natural language processing (NLP) tools, have also been
developed to analyze vaccine information and identify new scientific insights. However, the existing VIOLIN
also faces new challenges in areas such as knowledge integration, interoperability, and analysis.
 In this proposal, we aim to systematically develop VIOLIN 2.0, which will be a community-based
comprehensive vaccine knowledgebase (KB) with data FAIRness. Basic science, clinical, and public health
(safety, epidemiology, vaccine coverage) knowledge will be included with robust linkage and analysis. Four
specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: Implement a pipeline for automatic knowledge harvest, standardization,
and integration using advanced ontology and natural language processing technologies. Aim 2: Expand the
vaccine KB and management. Three specific knowledge aspects will be included: (i) vaccine formulation and
development, (ii) protective responses, and (iii) vaccine safety. Aim 3: Provide VIOLIN 2.0 knowledge browser,
query, and showcases. For showcase demonstration, three use cases will be built up, including pattern
detection of vaccine components (including protective antigens and vaccine adjuvants), vaccine-induced host
immune signatures, and vaccine adverse events. The patterns identified will be utilized with statistical and
machine learning methods to support rational vaccine design and immune signature prediction. Aim 4:
Community engagement and outreach. Many events such as hackathons and workshops will be held to
support the development and applications of community-based ontologies, standards, and tools.
 VIOLIN 2.0 will significantly enhance the VIOLIN with breadth and depth of vaccine information, include
knowledge not available in the current VIOLIN (e.g., vaccine adverse events), and develop new methods for
efficient and scalable knowledge extraction and analysis. Our study will advance the understanding of vaccine
mechanisms, and support rational vaccine design against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."
10854965,"ABSTRACT
Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic condition affecting 1 in 600 males who have an additional X
chromosome (47,XXY) associated with multisystem manifestations and increased mortality secondary to
disorders of insulin resistance. One of the hallmark features of KS is primary testicular failure resulting in
hypogonadism, and to date androgen treatment has been the only therapeutic intervention studied in these
individuals. However, insulin resistance and abnormal metabolism have been observed in youth with KS prior
to the onset of testicular hypogonadism. Furthermore, testosterone replacement does not ameliorate these
cardiometabolic deficits that the majority of these individuals experience. The underlying molecular
mechanisms for the high prevalence of insulin resistance and exercise intolerance observed in KS are
unknown. This application proposes that the additional X chromosome leads to metabolic aberrations that can
be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) is
transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes controlling fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, and
oxidative stress. Low PPAR-α activity is associated with cardiometabolic profiles similar to that observed in KS,
including adiposity, dyslipidemia, and exercise intolerance. Our preliminary data have shown a metabolome
and transcriptome consistent with insufficient activity of the PPAR-α complex in males with KS. The central
hypothesis of this study is that lower PPAR-α activity contributes to the cardiometabolic phenotype in KS and
that increasing PPAR-α activity via PPAR-α agonist treatment will result in upregulation of gene transcription
that will improve cardiometabolic physiology. In this proof-of-concept trial, we will first compare expression of
PPAR-α-regulated genes from whole blood and skeletal muscle in adolescent and young adult males with and
without KS, as well as systemic fat oxidation during submaximal prolonged exercise and tissue-specific
mitochondrial ß-oxidation. Resting energy expenditure, metabolite concentrations, and patient-centered
outcomes will also be obtained and compared between groups. The KS cohort will then receive intervention
with a PPAR- α agonist (fenofibrate) for one month, and all outcomes will be reassessed. This study will lay the
foundation for future investigation of the first ever non-androgen treatment to improve insulin resistance and
exercise intolerance in males with KS. The study aims support the mission and priority areas of the NIDDK and
are expected to have direct clinical implications for individuals with KS."

The human genome encodes 538 protein kinases, most of which are functionally important and are involved in
the pathogenesis of many diseases. This new R01 is a discovery-based grant focused on the molecular
validation of novel kinases that are upregulated in endometriosis. To address new therapeutic options for
endometriosis, we will validate a subset of endometriosis-implicated kinases using siRNA knockdown
strategies and available small molecule inhibitors and subsequently use DNA-Encoded Chemistry Technology
(DEC-Tec) to identify novel therapeutic molecules for further chemical validation in vitro and in vivo. We
identified dozens of kinases that are statistically upregulated in the lesions of patients with ovarian
endometriosis, peritoneal endometriosis, and/or deep infiltrating endometriosis compared to control and patient
endometrium. The hypothesis for this R01 is that inhibition of one or more of these novel kinase targets will be
effective in the treatment of endometriosis. In this proposal, we outline a comprehensive approach to
functionally characterize and target kinases in primary endometriotic stromal cells and organoid cultures
derived from women. In parallel, we will utilize state-of-the-art DEC-Tec selection methods available in the
Center for Drug Discovery (CDD) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) to identify novel kinase inhibitors that
will then be re-synthesized without the DNA barcode and chemically optimized by our team. We currently have
a screening collection of over 6 billion DNA-encoded molecules. The overarching objective is to identify potent
and selective kinase inhibitors that can provide a foundation for new medicines to address the unmet clinical
needs of endometriosis patients. The Specific Aims are: 1) Perform target validation of overexpressed kinases;
2) Use DEC-Tec to identify novel small-molecule inhibitors of validated kinases and optimize the selectivity,
activity, and stability of high affinity kinase binders; and 3) Evaluate optimized high affinity kinase inhibitors in
vitro and in vivo. Identifying new efficacious therapies for endometriosis requires a multifaceted approach that
necessitates increased efforts to identify and screen novel targets for drug discovery. Our approach, which
combines gene expression datasets for target identification with a novel DEC-Tec drug discovery platform, will
rapidly advance key kinase targets through a well-established drug discovery pipeline. Our multidisciplinary
team is seeking to discover new chemical entities that address the non-hormonal axes of endometriosis as
stand-alone therapy or as sequential therapy during hiatus from endocrine-suppressing agents. Our DEC-Tec
platform will help us to find the first specific inhibitors of unexplored kinases (a major druggable class of
proteins) that are elevated in endometriosis to dissect these key physiological pathways and pathological
mechanisms underlying endometriosis and provide new disease-specific treatment options."

Project Summary
Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type
2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed
“atypical diabetes”, that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that atypical diabetes comprises a
spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g., MODY/monogenic, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes)
and unknown. During the current U54 funding cycle we established the Rare and Atypical Diabetes
Network (RADIANT), with a well-functioning infrastructure to identify and enroll participants with atypical
diabetes; a pipeline for harmonized screening and adjudication of enrolled participants; full genomic
characterization of participants via whole genome sequencing; transcriptomic characterization via RNA
sequencing; quantitative plasma metabolomics; patient-specific, inducible pluripotent stem cell-based
molecular physiology; enrollment of informative family members; and both standard and specialized
phenotyping for each participant. In the next cycle of RADIANT, we propose to continue to recruit persons
with atypical forms of diabetes to fulfill the original goals, together with discovery and analysis of the
mechanisms and pathways that define these new forms of diabetes, by achieving the following Aims: 1)
Continue the identification, genome sequencing, transcriptomic and metabolomic interrogation, and deep
phenotyping of individuals and families with atypical forms of diabetes; 2) Discover and describe new forms
of monogenic diabetes; 3) Expand and enrich the growing database to characterize atypical diabetes and
recognize different genotypic and phenotypic clusters; and 4) Determine the pathophysiological
mechanisms of atypical diabetes genomic variants. Thus, in the next cycle of RADIANT, our collaborative,
multidisciplinary and diverse group of accomplished diabetes investigators will expand our repository of
atypical diabetes cases, identify new disease mechanisms, target pathogenic pathways, advance our
understanding of diabetes pathophysiology and develop an improved, etiologically based classification of
diabetes."
10862336,"Conte Center – Understanding Latent Cause Inference in Health and Illness
Latent cause inference is the fundamental cognitive process by which we draw boundaries between situations
that have different underlying rules, and therefore require separate learning and decision making. Every piece
of information that enters our brain is first categorized as pertaining to something we already know about (an
old latent cause) or something completely new (a new latent cause).
Because latent cause inference is at the heart of perception, learning, evaluation, and action selection,
alterations in this process may be at the core of a wide variety of mental health conditions. Following a
computational psychiatry approach that bridges abstract symptoms to basic neurocognitive mechanisms using
computational models, we propose a comprehensive investigation of latent cause inference as a proposed new
transdiagnostic NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain. We propose a research program centered
around three themes: quantifying individual differences in latent cause inference and relating them to mental
health symptoms, testing for alterations of this process in clinical samples, and delineating the neural circuitry
underlying latent cause inference. These themes cut across four proposed projects (P1-P4):
P1 – Latent cause inference as a fundamental cognitive process will relate individual differences in latent
cause inference to dimensional mental health symptom factors, and identify the neural circuitry involved in
creating and reusing latent causes.
P2 – Latent cause inference in compulsion will test a novel interpretation of compulsive disorders (e.g.,
obsessive compulsive disorder, drug misuse) as arising from over-splitting of latent causes.
P3 – Latent cause inference in anxiety will investigate the interaction of latent cause inference with memory
retrieval and updating, and their failure modes in anxiety disorders.
P4 – Neural mechanisms underlying latent cause inference will probe neural mechanisms of latent cause
inference using high-density neuronal recordings and chemogenetic manipulation of orexin in rat amygdala.
The proposed projects are tightly interconnected, all employing a shared theoretical framework and
computational modeling approach and relying on integration of methods and results to obtain a
comprehensive understanding of latent cause inference in mental illness and in health. They will build on
three Research Cores (Behavioral Testing and Clinical Assessment, Computational Modeling, and
Neuroimaging). The investigators have a long and productive history of collaboration, and each is organically
involved in multiple Projects and/or Cores, ensuring optimal integration of knowledge and methods. The
Conte Center will allow us to conduct a multidimensional and translational characterization of a new candidate
cognitive process for the RDoC matrix, tying it to mental illnesses and uncovering its neural mechanisms."
10862337,"CORE A – Administrative Core
This Conte Center – Understanding latent cause inference in health and illness – will bring together 10 highly
accomplished investigators from two neighboring institutions, Princeton University and Rutgers University,
who will employ a multidisciplinary computational-translational approach to investigate latent cause
inference. In keeping with the team's strong collaborative tradition and years of communication around the
ideas at the heart of this proposal, each Project and Core will be co-led by multiple investigators, each of which
is involved in more than one component of the Center.
Within this highly integrated setting, the Administrative Core A will provide administrative oversight and
support to all Projects and Research Cores to coordinate their activities, facilitate data-sharing, and foster close
collaborative links and synergy that will be critical to the success of the Center.
Core A has the following three aims:
Aim 1 - Facilitate scientific oversight through effective communication and coordination. Core A will
provide structure and robust mechanisms for communication and the exchange of data, ideas and discoveries
through regular videoconferences and face-to-face meetings. The Core will also provide support for all
administrative responsibilities of the Center, including monthly budget reports, annual allocation and re-
allocation of budgets, progress reports, and coordinate meetings among all investigators.
Aim 2 - Administer and oversee data-sharing within the Center and with NIMH. Core A will create a secure,
shared-resource repository where all data and code can be shared freely across Projects and Cores, oversee
submission of resources into this repository, and establish a system for obtaining data for analysis by other
researchers. The Core will also oversee and facilitate data-sharing of human subjects data on the NIMH Data
Archive twice yearly, as well as sharing of data and code from published papers using the Open Science
Framework. We are committed to open science and view data and resource sharing as integral to our goals.
Aim 3 - Coordinate training and outreach. Core A will develop and implement training programs for research
assistants, students, and postdoctoral fellows; develop and administer a summer undergraduate research
program in coordination with similar existing programs at Princeton and Rutgers; and coordinate public
outreach of Center discoveries including the development and maintenance of a website to provide a hub for
sharing findings and resources with the broader scientific community and the general public."
10862338,"PROJECT 1 – Latent cause inference as a fundamental cognitive process
Latent cause inference is a fundamental cognitive process that allows us to group experiences together, so that
what happened in past events can easily influence what we do in new (similar) situations. Different
individuals might group events differently into latent causes, depending on the parameters of latent cause
inference in their brain: how readily they create new latent causes to explain novel experiences, how persistent
they believe latent causes are across time, and how similar they expect events to be that are ascribed to a
shared latent cause.
Because latent cause inference is at the heart of perception, learning, evaluation, and action selection,
alterations in the process due to extreme parameters may lead to psychopathology. For instance, over-splitting
of latent causes can prevent updating of previous knowledge with new contradicting information (see Project
4), possibly leading to a disorder of compulsion (Project 2) or anxiety (Project 3). Parameters of the latent
cause inference process may therefore provide useful biomarkers for vulnerability to psychopathology, and
this cognitive process may present an important transdiagnostic dimension that should be added to the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.
In Project 1, our goal is to characterize fundamental individual differences in latent cause inference and relate
them to mental health symptom dimensions in a large general population sample (Aim 1.1), test their potential
relevance to several key mental health conditions (generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and
schizophrenia; Aim 1.2), and understand the circuitry that realizes latent cause inference in the brain, and its
alteration in psychiatric conditions (Aim 1.3). Towards these aims, we will use three behavioral tasks, one
laboratory task designed specifically to measure latent cause inference (the Microbes Task), and two
naturalistic event segmentation tasks that measure individual differences in perception of boundaries in
naturalistic streams of events (movies or stories).
By characterizing latent cause inference across mental health conditions and using multiple tasks, the results of
Project 1 will provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential use of latent cause inference as an RDoC
construct. Moreover, data from this project will provide strong constraints for the computational model of
latent cause inference developed by Core C, which will be used to analyze data from all projects in this Center.
In this way, association of latent cause inference parameters with a variety of symptom dimensions will help
constrain and interpret results in Projects 2 and 3, and the results of Aim 1.3 will potentially inform neural
recordings in Project 4."
10862339,"PROJECT 2 – Latent cause inference in compulsion
A promising line of research has suggested that a transdiagnostic dimension of compulsive psychopathology
arises from an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual systems for instrumental behavior. On this view,
compulsive behaviors as in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and drug misuse share an automatic,
inflexible character because they are produced by an over-dominant habit system that is goal-insensitive.
Although this account has been extremely influential, it fails to explain important aspects of these disorders,
such as their tight association with symptoms that suggest (paradoxically, in this view) a strong focus on
specific goals, like taking actions to terminate obsessional fears or consume craved drugs.
In Project 2, we leverage the latent cause inference framework to test a novel mechanism for seemingly goal-
insensitive behavior linked to compulsivity. By our proposed account, rather than overreliance on habitual
control, compulsivity can be understood as failure to generalize information about goal value between contexts
owing to overly narrow inferences about latent causes underlying experiences. This leads to a persistence in
goal value and behaviors aimed at achieving the goal, because information devaluing the goal is treated as
belonging to a different latent cause and thus irrelevant to the current context (see Project 4 for devaluation
experiments and Project 3 for consequences of excessive separating of latent causes for anxiety disorders). This
new model preserves the successes of the habit-based account for explaining compulsive behaviors, but also
extends to incorporate additional aspects of disorders of compulsivity, such as obsessions and craving.
Putative habitual behavior is often measured experimentally via a signature insensitivity to changing reward
contingencies, using a two-step decision task we developed. However, our recent theoretical work shows that
latent cause over-separation offers a second explanation for these behaviors, leaving open the question to what
extent latent cause separation contributed to previously reported associations of habits with compulsivity.
Here we use the two-step decision task modified to differentiate the relative contributions of goal insensitivity
and latent cause separation. Across three aims, we compare the differential association of these two
mechanisms with symptoms and diagnoses in both general population (Aim 2.1) and clinical samples (OCD
and alcohol use disorder, Aim 2.2). We also use fMRI to measure novel neural signatures of latent cause
inference and test whether these processes are sensitive to goal-relevant symptoms using a symptom
provocation manipulation (Aim 2.3). If successful, this project will provide the foundation for an entirely new
way of thinking about compulsivity with potential for major impact on our theoretical understanding and
treatment of this core transdiagnostic symptom. This revised view may spur new intervention targets,
including cognitive and behavioral interventions aimed at promoting broad, more appropriate generalization."

10853956,"Abstract
 In 2021, the US Surgeon General issued an advisory warning of a youth mental health crisis, exacerbated
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Latinx youth, a group marginalized by race, ethnicity, class, and culture, have
exceedingly high rates of internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Ecosocial theory posits that
historical, societal, and ecological conditions over the life course have critical impacts on later mental health.
This research will examine how distal and proximal societal stressors influence mental health trajectories for a
diverse sample of US Latinx youth followed from early childhood into young adulthood. Distal societal
stressors, such as the pandemic, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and neighborhood ethnic marginalization, may
increase Latinx youth’s internalizing symptoms directly and indirectly through proximal societal stressors, such
as families’ COVID-related economic, health, and social problems and individuals’ perceptions of immigrant
threats and ethnic discrimination. These kinds of societal stressors also may have direct and indirect effects on
increased internalizing symptoms through family stress processes, including maternal depression and harsh
parenting. The nature of youth’s exposure to these stressors (for how long, when in history and development)
and the presence of protective adaptive factors (e.g., parents’ cultural socialization; youth self-regulation) can
moderate stressor impacts on internalizing symptoms. This research will leverage advances in Integrated Data
Analysis (IDA) to pool data from five longitudinal Latinx cohort studies to obtain a single, aggregated data set
with 2,515 Latinx mother-youth dyads following youth from age 2 to 22 (2010-26). IDA increases statistical
power, sample heterogeneity and generalizability, and measurement breadth and depth in ways not possible
with a single data set. The application will support 1) collecting cross-sectional data for 500 Latinx individuals
to establish standard measurement scaling across the five studies; 2) integrating data across all five studies;
and 3) extracting data from Twitter and the US Census to assess anti-immigrant rhetoric and neighborhood
factors, respectively. Analyses will utilize a general latent variable modeling framework that includes multilevel
modeling, structural equation modeling, item response modeling, and finite mixture modeling. We hypothesize
a cascade of effects from distal societal stressors to increased internalizing symptoms through greater
proximal societal stressors and increased family stress processes. We expect that pathways linking societal
stressors to youth’s internalizing symptoms will vary depending upon the presence of adaptive factors, the
developmental timing and cumulative effects of youth experiences, and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g.,
youth biological sex, family national origin). This study offers an unparalleled opportunity to understand Latinx
mental health in relationship to multi-level stressors, adaptive factors, and sensitive periods of development. As
Latinx youth comprise more than one-in-four US youth, findings from this research will help guide new
preventive interventions and refine existing ones for a large and growing segment of the US population."
10853995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) of the City University of New York (CUNY) is requesting
funds from NIH through the High-End Instrumentation program to purchase a timsTOF-FleX MALDI-2, high-
resolution mass-spectrometer with trapped-ion mobility (TIMS) technology and a dual ion-source platform for
metabolomics and proteomics studies. This instrument will support biomedical research projects of twelve
laboratories from within CUNY and nearby institutions, including investigators from the Structural Biology and
Neuroscience Initiatives at the ASRC, City College of New York, neighboring institutions in New York
(Columbia University, Rockefeller University), and other laboratories in the region and nationally. The projects
span biochemistry and structural biology from macromolecular to metabolomic levels, with two general areas of
focus: (1) conformational dynamics of light-sensitive proteins, kinases, large systems as platelet integrins, and
ryanodine receptors; (2) metabolic signals regulating tumor progression, and axonal regeneration and to
metabolic control of brain cell population dynamics, with an emphasis on epigenetic regulation of glial cell
differentiation and dietary effects on metabolites affecting neurodegeneration. The anticipated outcomes are
better mechanistic definitions of processes regulating critical biological functions, giving insights into
fundamental biology, ways that these mechanisms are impacted by disease, and routes to successful
therapeutic and biotechnology strategies.
 Currently, no similar instruments are available in shared facilities in the New York City area. The novel
technology incorporated into the proposed timsTOF-FleX MALDI-2 instrument will provide us with tools to
significantly enhance the sensitivity and resolution of our mass measurements, enabling separation of
challenging isomeric and isobaric species, confident detection and identification of many more molecular
compounds in various Omics studies, and use of Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange mass-spectrometry to
increasingly complex macromolecular assemblies. Finally, the dual MALDI-MS and ESI-MS platform of
timsTOF-fleX MALDI-2 will provide our users with the ability to map molecular distributions in tissue in situ,
identify regions of interest that express the desired molecular profile, and selectively target these
subpopulations for integrated Omics analyses. Thus, should this proposal be approved by NIH, the novel
instrument will advance a number of collaborative research efforts in biomedical research being conducted at
the ASRC and beyond, expand training opportunities for early career scientists.
 The instrument will be housed in the ASRC building and managed by the PI within the ASRC Mass-
Spectrometry Core Shared Facility. All projects that require integrated MALDI-Imaging and complementary
traditional Omics analysis will be supported by the MALDI-MS Imaging Joint Facility, co-directed by the PI and
Dr. Ye He, director of the ASRC Live Imaging and Bioenergetics Facility."
10857242,"SUMMARY
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 233 million people
globally. The US alone has reported ~126,000 coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cases in pregnant
individuals, not including many asymptomatic and unconfirmed cases. Thus, potentially millions of children
worldwide may be impacted by the sequelae of prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
Animal research has shown that various maternal viral infections during pregnancy are associated with impaired
neurodevelopment in offspring. In line with these findings, epidemiological studies suggest that prenatal
exposure to infections is linked to neurodevelopmental deviations, and an elevated risk for ASD. There is an
urgent need for prospective, well-characterized birth cohorts to study the link between prenatal exposure to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk for adverse child development, particularly in light of a global health crisis with
potentially lifelong consequences for the child. Moreover, pregnant women are now being vaccinated against
COVID-19 on a large scale. Vaccines elicit a brief immune response, ranging from mild to severe, with fever and
increased cytokine levels. While studies have shown that these vaccines are safe during pregnancy, the long-
term effects on the child's developing brain are unknown.
This study aims to investigate the association of prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19
vaccination with behavior, cognition, and brain functioning in the child at 3 years of age. We hypothesize that
SARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impact child outcomes, mediated by changes to the fetal immune system. We
further hypothesize that COVID-19 vaccines are safe, with little to no long-term effects on the child.
We will leverage our on-going prospective pregnancy cohort `Generation C', which we established at The Mount
Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC) in the early weeks of the pandemic (> 2,800 women enrolled). The
cohort is racially/ethnically and socio-economically diverse. We obtained the following: 1) maternal blood
samples during pregnancy, and at delivery; 2) maternal SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers for each blood draw; 3)
demographic and clinical data; and 4) neonatal dried blood spots (DBS). In the proposed project, we will (i)
follow-up SARS-CoV-2 exposed, vaccine-exposed and non-infected and non-vaccinated mother-child dyads 3
years after birth, combining (ii) existing information on maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19
vaccination status during pregnancy, with (iii) newly collected data on SARS-CoV-2 antibody and cytokine levels
in neonatal DBS; (iv) childhood neurodevelopment including behavior, cognition, and motor development, and
(iv) brain functioning using electroencephalogram (EEG)."

The research project outlined in this Fast track SBIR submission will develop the RAE cHealth platform into a
tool to address digital inequities and support peer-based collaborative recovery for individuals with substance
use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to develop and deploy the RAE cHealth system-
consisting of a wearable sensor and a smartphone app. RAE cHealth combines objective physiologic data
analysis to identify stress and craving, collection of important user driven data on social determinants of health
and barriers to recovery, visualization to understand special and temporal relationships, and constant
connection to peer recovery personnel via in-app multiple communications options, including telehealth. The
specific aims are to Aim 1) Conduct a needs assessment to understand current barriers and facilitators of
digital health use in individuals with socioeconomic disadvantage and SUD who engage with peer recovery
services. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to understand required features
Aim 2) Iteratively pilot test RAE cHealth in three cohorts of N= 5 subjects for compliance and usability in our
target population. Prior to transitioning to Phase II, we will develop the fully functional RAE cHealth app based
on three prototype audit/feedback cycles, and achieve an average system usability score of 68. Aim 3) Deploy
RAE cHealth within peer support-based SUD collaborative care organizations. We will conduct an
observational trial of RAE cHealth through three community-based outreach programs to assess retention in
services, healthcare resource utilization, return to substance use, employment data, psychosocial functioning,
and usability, and Aim 4) Explore additional features based on SDoH data to enhance algorithms for the
detection of stress and craving and those predictive of treatment-related outcomes. Upon completion, RAE
cHealth will be a ready-for-market collaborative digital clinical decision intervention to support community-
based recovery programs, and a value-added tool for SUD treatment programs to improve outcomes with
objective data, and ultimately to support recovery. Findings from this work will not only inform the development
in this specific use case but will be broadly applicable to the personalization of mHealth across disease states,
which is ultimately needed to bridge the digital divide and make digital healthcare widely accessible."
10857246,"Project Summary/Abstract
Making sense of visual scenes requires a correct assignment of the borders that occur between object and
background, or between objects, to the foreground object. Macaque visual cortical areas V2, V4 and V1 contain
neurons that are selective for border ownership. These cells encode border ownership even if distal visual cues
that define which sides of a boundary are object and ground fall far outside of the neuron’s receptive field. This
selectivity often persists even when these distal cues disappear, a form of stimulus hysteresis or memory. Prior
studies suggest that this border ownership selectivity relies on corticocortical feedback from hypothetical
downstream neurons with receptive fields that cover the complete object, termed grouping cells. No prior study
has found these hypothesized grouping cells. Thus, though border ownership cells have been found, the neural
circuits that endow them with border ownership selectivity remain poorly understood, as does their role in
perception. The goals of the proposed research are to determine the micro-organization of border ownership
and grouping cells in the macaque visual cortex, and to relate their activity to perceived border ownership. The
candidate will use advanced electrophysiological, optophysiological and viral targeting techniques in behaving
macaques to achieve these goals. In Aim 1, the candidate will use two-photon calcium imaging to identify border
ownership cells and grouping cells, and test specific hypotheses about how they are organized within the
columnar layout of macaque Area V4. In Aim 2, the candidate will combine two-photon calcium imaging and viral
targeting techniques to distinguish excitatory from inhibitory neurons in V4, and assess their role in border
ownership. In Aim 3, the candidate will relate the activity of border ownership and grouping cells in areas V2/V1
and V4 to perception by recording their activity with laminar multielectrodes while reading out perceived border
ownership. The candidate has extensive electrophysiological expertise including in behaving non-human
primates, but needs training in two-photon calcium imaging and viral approaches, which are the technical goals
of the career development plan. The primary mentor is Dr. John Reynolds, a leader in the neurophysiology of
visual cortex in behaving macaques. The co-mentor is Dr. Ed Callaway, a pioneer in viral targeting and two-
photon imaging in macaques. Both Dr. Reynolds and Dr. Callaway have a strong history of mentoring young
scientists and are faculty at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, an institute with a strong history in visual
neuroscience. Recent advances in optical recording techniques and viral approaches have enabled high-
resolution studies of genetically targeted neurons in functioning neural circuits. Combined with his background
in electrophysiology, the additional training will provide the candidate with the expertise that will enable him to
launch a successful career as an independent investigator studying the neural basis of visual perception in
behaving non-human primates. A deeper understanding of the computations performed in the primate visual
cortex is imperative for designing better diagnostic tools and treatments for central visual processing disorders."
10857247,"The human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes are monooxygenases involved in the metabolism of
steroid hormones, pharmaceuticals, carcinogens, and fat-soluble vitamins. P450 enzymes therefore have many
direct impacts on human health. The study of P450 enzymes has led to several important advances in medicine
including new therapies and the safer use of existing therapies. One important, yet understudied family of human
P450 enzymes is the 27 family including P450 27A1, 27B1, and 27C1. These enzymes catalyze the oxidations
of several important lipophilic hormones including vitamin D derivatives (27A1 and 27B1), cholesterol derivatives
(27A1), and retinoids (27C1). The products of these reactions can have either positive or negative effects on
human health depending on their concentrations in the body. Therefore, it could be valuable to either increase
or decrease these enzymes’ activities for clinical therapies. This research project focuses on how the structure
of the enzymes determines their function. In particular, we are interested in how the interactions between the
P450 enzymes and the redox partner protein adrenodoxin can alter enzyme structure and in turn P450 function.
We are also interested in the development of uncompetitive drug therapies that can act more selectively to
prevent enzyme activity by altering enzyme structure. We propose that a thorough mechanistic description of
the P450 27 family structure-function relationship will inform the development of new and safer therapies
involving these enzymes and various cancers, hormone regulation, and bone health. The focus on lipophilic
hormones is in line with the overall vision of the laboratory examining the function of other membrane-associated,
lipid-active enzymes for the sake of developing new clinical therapies. Over the next five years, the goals of the
laboratory include applying structural approaches novel to the study of P450 enzymes like small-angle X-ray
scattering and small-angle neutron scattering, applying classic structural approaches to P450 enzymes like X-
ray crystallography, determining the effects adrenodoxin has on P450 function, and testing the ability of known
P450 27A1 inhibitors to act in an uncompetitive manner. To accomplish these goals, we will expand our
laboratory personnel while maintaining a focus on undergraduate research training. In total, the laboratory seeks
to improve human health by increasing our basic understanding of enzyme function and by working to embrace
diversity in training the next generation of biomedical scientists."

Childhood obesity remains a significant problem which impacts children’s health. Family-focused child obesity
treatment is efficacious but unfortunately not all children receive the same benefit, especially racial and ethnic
minority groups, those on Medicaid and those with insecure housing. Adverse social determinants of health,
social risk factors (SRF), are key factors influencing child obesity treatment outcomes. Some challenges are
logistical (e.g., lack of transportation). Yet, juggling scarce resources (e.g., money, food) also takes physical,
emotional, and mental energy. Bandwidth is our capacity to allocate and use our limited cognitive resources
effectively and is impacted by scarcity of time or resources. Lack of bandwidth can lead to poor food choices,
weight gain and difficulty learning. Intervening on SRF may have a significant impact on parent bandwidth,
allowing parents and children to benefit more fully from child obesity interventions. A community health worker
(CHW) can be used to connect families to resources to address SRF and support their ability to engage in child
obesity treatment. The long-term goals of this work are to test whether child obesity treatment outcomes can
be improved by systematically addressing SRF and whether bandwidth is an important mediator. This proposal
will complete a pilot in preparation for a larger trial. The specific aims of this project are 1. To test the feasibility
and acceptability of a trial comparing families with SRF receiving CHW support plus a child obesity treatment
intervention (CHW+PHIT Kids) and those receiving one-time resource referrals and the obesity intervention
(PHIT Kids). We will look at recruitment, retention, satisfaction with CHW intervention and PHIT Kids, and other
implementation outcomes. 2. To compare outcomes between CHW+PHIT Kids and PHIT Kids and gather
effect sizes on outcome measures to guide a future full-scale trial. Outcomes to be examined over 6 months
include1) BMI z-score (primary), 2) child dietary intake (24-hour diet recalls: servings of fruits and vegetables,
sugar-sweetened beverages, and high-sugar/high fat foods), 3) child moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(accelerometer, minutes per day) and 4) parent weight. 3. To explore the role of parents’ bandwidth as a
potential mediator for the implementation and treatment outcomes. The project will recruit 60 families with an
8- to 12-year-old child with obesity or overweight and a positive SRF screen. Families will be randomized to 1)
assistance obtaining needed resources using an existing scalable CHW intervention or 2) a one-time standard
of care referral to resources. At three months all families will receive a virtually delivered 3-month child obesity
treatment intervention. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. This research is significant as it
will give insight into how to improve the efficacy of child obesity treatment interventions for our most vulnerable
children by systematically attending to SRF and innovative in exploring bandwidth as a mediator of this
relationship. This research will provide the necessary data to support a full-scale clinical trial. This work could
significantly alter the way providers deliver obesity treatment and improve health equity."

Understanding how brain states influence sensory coding is fundamental in advancing our knowledge of the
mechanisms by which neural circuits encode sensory information. The basal forebrain cholinergic system has
long been implicated in such state changes and has been shown to play a crucial role in the detection, selection,
and processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, to date, almost all work regarding cholinergic
modulation of olfactory circuits has focused on the effects of acetylcholine on olfactory system neurons while
largely ignoring the circumstances that drive cholinergic neuron activity. Thus, very little is currently known
regarding the conditions that drive basal forebrain cholinergic neuron activity or the characteristics of cholinergic
fiber activity within the olfactory bulb. Further, fundamental questions also remain regarding the primary function
of ACh release on olfactory coding, as most prior studies have focused on olfactory responses in anesthetized
mice. For example, in the olfactory bulb, acetylcholine release is thought to enhance the sensitivity of olfactory
bulb output cell odor responses and lead to improved olfactory discrimination. However, no experiments have
been performed directly addressing these hypothesized functions in awake animals, leaving acetylcholine’s
ultimate function within early olfactory regions unknown. The overall goal of this project is to understand this
process by investigating how sensory input, stimulus novelty, and odor discrimination drive olfactory projecting
cholinergic neuron activity and how this impacts olfactory odor responses. Our central hypothesis is that olfactory
projecting cholinergic neurons preferentially respond to novel stimuli and impart information regarding salience
to the olfactory circuits. We will use calcium imaging of defined cholinergic and olfactory system cell types
combined with chemogenetic manipulation in awake animals during well-characterized olfactory-mediated
behaviors to test this hypothesis. The findings of these experiments will be significant in that they will
fundamentally advance our knowledge of the function of cholinergic input during olfactory-related events, how
this affects sensory representations at multiple levels within the olfactory system, and how this ultimately impacts
olfactory perception and discrimination."
10846846,"The Crane group studies signal transduction systems that respond to or involve photochemistry and redox
chemistry. Our overall goal is to understand the behaviors of bacterial chemotaxis and eukaryotic circadian
rhythms at the level of molecular reactivity through the study of macromolecular complexes that underlie
transmembrane signaling, motility, and gene expression. Chemotaxis has long served as a key system for
studying transmembrane signaling, intracellular information transfer, and cell locomotion. Furthermore, many
human pathogens that cause diseases, such as cholera, gastric cancer, and Lyme, rely on chemotaxis to
establish and sustain infection. The sensory apparatus of chemotaxis displays remarkable sensitivity, dynamic
range, and molecular memory. Chemoreceptors, histidine kinases (CheA), and coupling proteins assemble into
large molecular arrays, wherein long-range cooperative interactions among components produce highly specific
responses that adapt to changing conditions. This proposal continues efforts to understand receptor:kinase
assembly, chemoreceptor conformational signaling, and ultimately, CheA regulation. CheA output modulates
Nature's consummate nanomachine – the flagella motor. The architecture of the switch complex within the motor
will be refined to better understand torque generation and direction switching. A particular focus will be the
pathogenic spirochetes, which exhibit asymmetric flagella rotation at their respective cell ends. The second
system, circadian clocks, comprises of cell-autonomous timing devices that pace metabolism to the diurnal cycle.
Clocks are composed of transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) within which repressor proteins
inhibit the transcriptional activators of their own genes. Light entrains the clock phase by stimulating
photosensors that impinge directly on the TTFLs. In humans, aberrant clock function causes mental illness (sleep
disorders, depression, and mania), cell growth deregulation (cancer), and metabolic defects (diabetes and
obesity). This project proposes structural and mechanistic investigations of the key light sensor and repressor
activities in representative clocks from fungi (Neurospora crassa) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster). A
complimentary set of biophysical techniques, including X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering,
optical spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and pulse dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS), will be applied to
accomplish these goals. Biochemical reconstitution that leverages protein engineering to procure key entities
will be combined with cellular assays and organismal studies in order to correlate physical properties with
biological function. For PDS, new methods for incorporating spin probes that are based on nitroxides, flavins,
nucleotides, and metal ions will be deployed for measuring structure and dynamics both in vitro and in vivo.
Computational design and molecular dynamics will be used to test and consolidate models. Overall, this program
aims to provide a molecular-level understanding for sensing and response through the synergistic application of
chemical and biophysical methods."

Paralog switching in chromatin remodeling complexes plays a key role in development and loss of regulatory
control over chromatin paralog functions is closely linked to many types of cancer. Human SIN3A and SIN3B
are amongst this class of important chromatin remodeling paralogs. SIN3A mutations are considered driver
mutations in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and both SIN3A and SIN3B haploinsufficiency linked to
human neurodevelopmental disorders. Human SIN3A and SIN3B are members of several large multiprotein
complexes involved in chromatin remodeling containing the histone deacetylase enzymes HDAC1 and HDAC2.
While the overall members of the SIN3A and SIN3B complexes is largely known, the structure and function of
specific complexes in these networks remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the precise targeting of gene
repression by SIN3/HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation is likely controlled by the non-catalytic SIN3 subunits
but also remains enigmatic. These fundamental gaps in knowledge regarding the structure and function of SIN3A
and SIN3B containing complexes limit our ability to devise specific therapeutic interventions in cancer, for
example. The overarching goal of the research in the laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms of
how specific SIN3A and SIN3B complexes regulate gene expression and chromatin remodeling in normal and
diseased human conditions. We are in a unique position to advance the understanding of these area of research
based on my strong track record and long-standing expertise in chromatin remodeling and proteomics,
assembled team of collaborators, and multidisciplinary approach. In our lab, we continually develop new
proteomic technologies and apply them to chromatin remodeling complexes and networks. Here, we will use a
comprehensive approach of affinity purification, enzyme kinetics, peptide synthesis, fluorescence microscopy,
genomics, quantitative proteomics, cross linking mass spectrometry, and integrative structural modeling. Using
these methodologies over the next five years, we will investigate 1) How are SIN3A and SIN3B complexes
assembled, 2) What are the regulatory functions of specific subunits, 3) How do SIN3A complexes regulate
specific transcription factor function, 4) What are the SIN3A and SIN3B networks in endometrial cells, and 5)
How can we disrupt protein protein interactions in these complexes? This set of questions will go from a
fundamental structure and function of these complexes to determining the role of specific complexes in important
human cellular models. We will lay the foundation to address the gap in knowledge in the diversity and function
of specific chromatin remodeling complexes. In addition, we will begin to develop new therapeutic strategies to
target specific chromatin remodeling complexes. With this information in hand, we will be closer to our long-term
goal and vision of designing peptide-based approaches to disrupt specific protein complexes as novel and
specific cancer therapeutic agents."

The Training Program in Environmental Toxicology is a long-standing research training program that
emphasizes molecular toxicology. The long-term objectives of the program are to provide rigorous training in
molecular toxicology through didactic approaches, while concurrently providing resources and support to
permit full and vibrant development of trainees’ research skills and careers. We will support a total of eight
predoctoral and four postdoctoral fellows annually. Our Specific Aims are to 1) Identify and recruit a diverse
group of faculty that allows trainees maximal choice in research topics, approaches, and mentoring styles; 2)
Identify and recruit strong trainees interested in pursuing a career in toxicology-related research and support
their development during critical periods of their predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships; 3) Provide clear
instruction in the principles of molecular toxicology and ensure that this education addresses fundamental
principles of toxicology and also reflects developing themes in research in toxicology and environmental health
in general. These aims are realized through the clear program plan, the strong faculty of preceptors, and the
robust training environment and resources at Vanderbilt. Our preceptor list includes 25 faculty with diverse
research interests and strong extramural support, with research programs having current year direct costs for
NIH and VA funded research totaling over $17 million. Faculty preceptors are identified whose research bears
a strong relevance to the NIEHS mission of understanding environmental drivers of human health and
disease, and preceptors are required to have attended formal mentoring training programs. In addition to the
highly experienced and successful mentors, inclusion of more junior faculty ensures continuation of our strong
tradition in investing in our trainees and their faculty to maximize potential. Predoctoral trainees are nominated
to the program at the end of their first year in graduate school following entry via one of the Vanderbilt
‘umbrella’ (interdisciplinary) programs. A series of three or four rotations during labs within the first year allows
trainees to select mentors and laboratories that are the best fit for them intellectually and according to topic
and allows mentors to identify students with a passion for toxicology-relevant research. In addition to hands-on
lab-based training and personalized mentorship, trainees receive comprehensive training in molecular
toxicology through one semester of didactic teaching (offered annually) and continued educational
opportunities and career development seminars in monthly meetings. In the present application the training
approach has been updated to reflect best practices in teaching and trainee feedback. Novel aspects in this
project period include introduction of new preceptors and a new multi-PI model. We have also refined our
training program to including a stronger focus on multiple aspects of career development suitable for those
continuing to academia, administrative, and industry positions."
10846640,"Project Summary
The degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ER-associated degradation
(ERAD) pathway prevents potentially toxic proteins from entering the secretory pathway. ERAD, however,
cannot clear all proteins from the ER. For example, some proteins, such as aggregation-prone proteins,
large polymers and fibrillar proteins, are resistant to degradation by ERAD and must be disposed of by
alternate disposal pathways. As aggregation prone proteins have been to linked to neurodegenerative
diseases, understanding how these alternate disposal pathways function is of medical importance.
 ER autophagy (ER-phagy) is a disposal pathway that degrades ER domains and aggregation-prone
proteins. How specific domains, on the continuous network of the ER, are targeted for degradation is
unknown. We have found that a non-canonical form of the COPII coat, that contains SEC24C-SEC23,
works with receptors on the ER to target domains for autophagy. ER-phagy sites (ERPHS) on the ER are
distinct from the ER exit sites where secretory cargo is loaded into canonical COPII coated vesicles that
traffic to the Golgi. Our findings suggest that ER structure may be important for the formation of ERPHS.
Additionally, mutations in several ER shaping proteins, associated with hereditary spastic paraplegias
(HSP), lead to defects in ER-phagy. These findings suggest a link between ER-phagy, the formation of the
ERPHS and HSP.
 In this proposal I describe several aims that are designed to address the role that ER structure plays
in the formation of ERPHS and the link between ERPHS formation and HSP. Specifically, we will perform
live cell imaging and mass spectroscopy experiments to characterize the ERPHS and their cargo. Misfolded
proteins, known to be degraded by ER-phagy, will be analyzed. To date six ER autophagy receptors have
been identified. Our studies will address when SEC24C interacts with the autophagy machinery and which
of the six known receptors interact with SEC24C. Our biochemical studies may lead to the identification of
new proteins that interact with SEC24C during ER autophagy. Autophagy reporters, imaging analysis and
biochemical studies will be used to address the role that ER organization and ER shaping proteins play in
ER-phagy and ERPHS formation. The proteins we will analyze in Aim 2 and Aim 3 are associated with HSP
and HSP-like neuropathies. In total, these studies will shed light on the link between ER structure, ERPHS
formation and HSP."
10846952,"This application is a request for diversity supplemental funding for Ms. Monique Martinez to initiate her
graduate studies in the laboratory of Dr. Taben Hale at the University of Arizona. This project examines the
fetal programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, an important system for regulating and
coordinating adrenal glucocorticoid (GC) secretion to allow for proper adaptation to stressors and maintain
physiological homeostasis. As part of the U54 program that oversees this project, Ms. Martinez will be a
member of the training program and be exposed to the educational mission that the SCORE program is
developing. Ms. Martinez will also work closely with the other PIs in the SCORE program. This includes Dr. Jill
Goldstein who is mPI of the Program and the Lead of Project 1 and Dr. Stuart Tobet who is mPI of the program
and PI of project 3. During development, increased exposure to GCs through prenatal stress or inflammation
can disrupt fetal brain programming and increase risk for long-term health consequences. The foundation for
this hypothesis is that the in-utero environment programs the brain and increases the risk developing long-term
complex diseases in adulthood. Diseases with fetal origins include depression and anxiety-like disorders,
social impairments, and cardiometabolic disorders. Common to each of these, is a dysregulation of the
autonomic nervous system. The overarching goal of Ms. Martinez’ project is to examine the effects of in utero
overexposure to GCs and inflammation on hypothalamic and cardiac development resulting in autonomic
dysregulation. Preliminary data has shown that rodents display cardiovascular and behavioral changes after in
utero exposure to the synthetic GC, dexamethasone (DEX). Specifically, late gestation exposure to DEX
results in female-biased autonomic dysregulation that is characterized by an increase in sympathetic and a
withdrawal of parasympathetic input to regulation of heart rate and blood pressure under basal and stress
conditions. Healthy females have been shown to show a greater reliance on parasympathetic input, as
compared to males. Preliminary findings suggest that prenatal DEX disrupts this normal development. Puberty
is known to be a critical developmental period for programming of the autonomic nervous system. Therefore,
studies outlined in this proposal test the hypothesis that puberty is a critical period for programing autonomic
nervous system, and that late gestation perturbations negatively impact these responses. Autonomic function
will be assessed in rats exposed to excess glucocorticoids (DEX) or inflammation (TLR7 agonist, resiquimod)
in utero pre- (3-4 weeks of age) and post-puberty (8-10 weeks of age). To determine the degree to which these
effects are peripherally mediated, cardiac responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
agonists will be evaluated ex vivo to remove any neural influences and reflex responses. These studies will
have implications for how the fetal environment affects adult hypothalamic function and how it contributes to
susceptibility for increased risk for multiple diseases."
10847447,"Obesity and its metabolic complications are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Evidence is
mounting that inappropriate timing of food intake contributes to obesity. Late eating is associated with obesity
and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that circadian misalignment may be the mechanism underlying the adverse
metabolic consequences of late eating. We hypothesize that meal timing in relation to the endogenous circadian
rhythm, rather than to clock hour, determines metabolic outcomes. In this study, we will use dim light melatonin
onset (DLMO), the gold-standard for ascertaining central circadian output, to assess individual circadian rhythms.
We will use DLMO to prospectively assign “early” (DLMO-3h) vs “late” (DLMO+1h) dinner while maintaining the
same sleep times (DLMO+2h to +10h) to evaluate whether acute metabolic dysfunction can be reliably induced
or prevented by setting dinner times around DLMO. We will use hourly blood sampling for detailed glucose and
insulin profiles, oral [2H31] palmitate tracer to quantify dietary fat oxidation, and whole-room indirect calorimetry
to measure total fat oxidation. We will enroll both normal-weight healthy adults (NWH) and adults with obesity
and prediabetes (OPD), as the latter population is particularly vulnerable to metabolic diseases and could derive
immediate benefit from our findings. The specific aims are to: 1) Quantify the impact of DLMO-based “early” vs.
“late” dinner time on post-prandial and overnight glucose and insulin levels in NWH and OPD adults, 2) Measure
the impact of DLMO-based “early” vs. “late” dinner time on (a) exogenous/dietary and (b) total fat oxidation in
NWH and OPD adults, and 3) Examine the utility of circadian phase markers to predict susceptibility to late
eating-induced metabolic dysfunction. For Aims 1 and 2, we will crossover-randomize 16 NWH adults (8 men, 8
women) and 16 OPD adults (8 men, 8 women) to the 2 dinner times with isocaloric feeding in a metabolic
chamber. For Aim 3, we will leverage validated circadian metrics derived from actigraphy and ingestible
thermosensors to predict effects of late dinner.
Dr. Daisy Duan’s long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator leveraging novel
mechanistic insights that underly the intersection between the circadian system and metabolism to design and
validate interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity and its metabolic complications. She seeks a
K23 mentored career development award to gain critical skills and experience in order to effectively lead an
independently-funded research program. The goals during the award period include developing expertise in the
design and implementation of in vivo metabolic studies and in the principles, practice, and analytical methods in
sleep and circadian phenotyping techniques, through a combination of mentored research experience, focused
coursework, hands-on learning in research methodology, participation in local and national conferences, grant
writing, and leadership training and experience. The proposed study will lay the foundation for novel, circadian-
based meal timing as a precision medicine approach to obesity and metabolic dysfunction."

Cellular stress response pathways are fundamental survival strategies that regulate protein homeostasis and
are misregulated in myriad diseases and aging. The mechanisms by which stress response pathways regulate
protein homeostasis, how well these mechanisms can perform, and why they fail in disease are major open
questions. We explore these questions from both a molecular and biophysical perspective. Over the next five
years, we plan to explore how cells detect and respond to defective protein translation, a process called
Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC). A major focus area will be CArboxyl-terminal Tails (CAT tails), a
form of protein synthesis we discovered in which ribosomes elongate defective proteins without guidance from
an mRNA template. We will also study biophysical responses to stress, including viscoadaptation, a stress
response we discovered in which cells regulate the diffusivity of biomolecules. We have a wealth of expertise
and experimental tools to continue our track record of making fundamental discoveries in stress response
pathways. Studying cellular stress response pathways at both the molecular and biophysical levels will lead to
deep insights into cell survival and the cell biology of disease."

The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) family of secreted peptide growth factors plays significant roles
in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis. Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling pathways is
associated with many diseases and disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and developmental
disorders. These ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies
that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways composed of heterotetrameric receptors and
Smad signal transducers. Many of the ligands have context-dependent and/or concentration-dependent
functions. BMPs are best known for their roles in development, but evidence is emerging for their roles as
regulators of homeostasis. While the core components of TGF-β signaling pathways have been identified for
more than 25 years, how these pathways produce context-dependent outcomes remains poorly understood. In
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-β ligands, two type I receptors, and one type II
receptor, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand-ligand and ligand-receptor interactions in a smaller number
of combinations than in vertebrates. Our preliminary data have established that DBL-1/BMP functions in lipid
metabolism and in innate immunity through mechanisms that are distinct from its roles in development.
Furthermore, we identified a role for TIG-2 (BMP-like) and TIG-3 (TGF-β/Activin-like) in the immune response
that may be mediated by the BMP-responsive Smad SMA-3. We are therefore poised to exploit this system to
identify context-dependent mechanisms that distinguish these physiological outcomes from the developmental
functions of signaling. Our research goals are to address these unanswered questions: (1) What are the
determinants of signaling specificity for TGF-β-related signaling pathways? Hypothesis: Alternative
ligand-ligand and ligand-receptor interactions are a mechanism for context-dependent responses. (2) How
does BMP signaling execute its fat-regulatory function at the subcellular and molecular levels?
Hypothesis: Genetic suppressors of the low-fat phenotype of dbl-1 mutants will reveal regulatory networks that
interact with BMP signaling to modulate fat storage. (3) Does altered lipid metabolism impact resilience to
pathogen exposure? Hypothesis: BMP-dependent mobilization of lipid stores contributes to survival on
pathogenic bacteria. Our established assays for fat accumulation and pathogen survival provide whole-
organism functional assessments for signaling. We will employ classical genetics, imaging, genomics, and
biochemistry to test our hypotheses at a mechanistic level. This integration of approaches, combined with the
reduced quantitative complexity in TGF-β signaling components, makes C. elegans the ideal model to address
these gaps in knowledge. Due to the high degree of conservation of TGF-β signaling pathways, we anticipate
valuable insight into universal mechanistic principles with implications for human health and disease."

Abstract
Social impairments are a common symptom among psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia,
and autism. However, the mechanisms by which the brain processes social information and uses it to guide
social behaviors remain unclear. In humans and rodents, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to exert
top-down inhibitory control over social behaviors, but the distinct neural circuitry involved has yet to be elucidated.
While non-specific global activation of mPFC neurons decreases sociability, recent reports indicate these effects
are mediated by activity changes in the posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT), a midline thalamic nucleus
known to play a role in motivated and emotional behaviors. This proposal aims to determine whether parvalbumin
(PV) interneurons in the mPFC gate activity in pPVT-projecting mPFC neurons to regulate social motivation. Our
pilot data indicate that chemogenetic activation of mPFC-pPVT pathway suppressed social motivation in male
but not female mice. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that pPVT-projecting mPFC neurons exert top-
down inhibitory control over social motivation in a sex-specific manner. In male mice, we predict that effective
social engagement requires suppressed activity of the mPFC-pPVT circuit mediated by activation of nearby PV
interneurons. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination of transgenic mice, viral optogenetic constructs,
behavioral testing, in vivo calcium imaging, and patch-clamp recording. Aim 1 will use optogenetics to precisely
activate or inhibit axonal terminals of mPFC neurons in the pPVT to reveal how manipulating this circuit regulates
social motivation. Aim 2 will combine pathway-specific calcium imaging via fiber photometry, chemogenetics,
and transgenic mice to determine whether mPFC-pPVT neurons are silenced during social interaction in a
manner that is dependent on PV interneuron activity. Aim 3 will determine if physiological differences exist in the
mPFC-pPVT circuit between male and female mice. This study will provide the first sex-specific evidence that
the mPFC-pPVT pathway represents a previously overlooked component of the social brain, especially in female
mice, and novel insights into the circuit mechanisms by which the PV interneurons in the mPFC play in the
regulation of social motivation."
10847788,"ABSTRACT
Double stranded DNA break (DSB)s are repaired by two major mechanistically distinct pathways, DNA
homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). A decisive factor in the choice
between HDR and NHEJ is in the competition between DNA end protection (necessary for NHEJ) and DNA end
resection (necessary for HDR). DSB end resection is appropriately restricted to S/G2 phases of the cell cycle,
as HDR requires the presence of an intact sister chromatid. Depletion of NHEJ promoting factors such as 53BP1
allows DNA end resection in the G1 phase, thereby impairing DSB repair and causing genomic instability.
Conversely, loss of the HDR protein BRCA1 (critical for initiating end resection) allows the error-prone NHEJ
pathway to dominate throughout the cell cycle potentially leading to tumorigenesis. BRCA1 deficient tumors are
exquisitely sensitive to inhibitors of the DNA repair protein, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Surprisingly,
loss of 53BP1 or associated factors (Shieldin complex, CST complex, etc) in these tumors render them
insensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), as DNA end resection and the subsequent steps of the HDR pathway
are restored. Loss of DYNLL1, a factor that is constitutively bound to 53BP1, also results in enhanced end
resection and HDR. DYNLL1 directly binds to and inhibits MRE11, thereby blocking the initiation of DNA end
resection. Phosphorylation of DYNLL1 on serine 88 enhances the formation of DYNLL1/MRE11 complex, albeit
reducing DYNLL1’s interaction with 53BP1. Our preliminary studies suggest that DNA-PKcs is responsible for
the phosphorylation of DYNLL1 and may be critical for inhibiting MRE11 and blocking HDR in BRCA1-deficient
cells. BRCA1 impedes activation of DNA-PKcs, indirectly preventing DYNLL1 phosphorylation and the inhibition
of MRE11. In BRCA1 proficient cells DYNLL1 promotes BRCA1/BARD1 mediated ubiquitination of MRE11,
thereby facilitating end resection at DSBs. In AIM1 we propose to investigate the dynamics between BRCA1 and
DNA-PKcs and how it regulates the DYNLL1 and MRE11 activity during the cell cycle. Like DYNLL1, the Shieldin
(SHLD1–SHLD2–SHLD3) and CST (CTC, STN1, and TEN1) complexes are recruited to DSBs in a 53BP1-
dependent manner, and loss of any of the subunits is also associated with increased end resection and HDR.
Intriguingly, SHLD1 is recruited to short-resected ssDNA in G1 phase of the cell cycle. This brings up one key
issue which is how the Shieldin complex, which primarily functions in G1, influences PARPi sensitivity in BRCA1-
mutant tumors. PARPi sensitivity has now been closely tied to replication fork stability and ssDNA gap formation.
Loss of REV7 and the CST complex have been shown to de-stabilize the fork which should cause PARPi
sensitivity. This is in contrast to PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutant cells. Together they suggest that the Shieldin
complex may have differential function in absence of BRCA1. We speculate that in BRCA1-mutant cells,
components of the Shieldin complex cannot be removed from DNA lesions thereby disrupting replication fork
dynamics and causing PARPi sensitivity. Therefore, in AIM2 we will test the hypothesis that (i) BRCA1 regulates
Shieldin localization and function at DSBs, and (ii) Shieldin is recruited to specific DNA “scars” where loss of
Shieldin confers PARPi resistance. Investigating the dynamics of these end resecting factors and their regulation
in DSB repair bear significant clinical relevance in combating PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutant tumors.
Therefore, in AIM3, we determine how alterations in 53BP1-dependent mechanisms of attenuated DNA end
resection may drive development of PARPi resistance in the high grade serous ovarian cancer using patient
derived xenografts and primary tumors."

We request to continue our NIA cohort study (‘LitCog’; R01AG030611). LitCog studies the confluence of
increased medical morbidity resulting in complex patient self-management (SM) roles, and cognitive decline,
which may affect older patients’ health literacy (HL) skills and chronic illness self-care. Functionally independent,
‘cognitively normal’ adults ages 55-74 (N=900) were recruited from community primary care practices in Chicago.
Participants have completed comprehensive cognitive, psychological, social, behavioral, and functional health
assessments every 3 years (4 interviews; 2008-2018). The sample is diverse by race, socioeconomic status and
medical morbidity; uncommon among cognitive aging studies. A 1st renewal award (LitCog II) examined changes
in cognition, HL and SM skills over 6 years and their associations with physical and mental health. We found
cognitive function to be strongly associated with HL; both decline together over time. Cognitive function and HL
also determine older adults’ SM skills; all predict functional health status and its decline. A 2nd renewal (LitCog
III) has allowed us to capture new health behaviors, chronic disease outcomes, and healthcare use from medical,
pharmacy records a decade post-baseline. Cognitive function, HL and SM skills impact all of these outcomes.
LitCog III is almost complete; 774 of 900 (86%) subjects are alive and available for further study.
We now propose to conduct follow-up assessments 12 and 15 years post-baseline (LitCog IV). With 6
interviews over 15 years, specific trajectories of decline in cognition, HL, SM skills and health status can be
closely studied. The prevalence of and adjustment to increasing morbidity, disability, cognitive impairment
(including Alzheimer’s Disease & Related Dementias (ADRD)) allow for new outcomes for investigation. Mortality
data will also now be available with extended follow-up. Our primary aim is to 1) evaluate trajectories in cognitive
function, HL and SM skills over 15 years among older adults, and their associations with health outcomes.
LitCog is an exceptionally unique cognitive aging cohort study as it is framed in the context of health services
research. Our goal has been to inform health system strategies for effectively managing older patients by
understanding how cognition changes and influences HL and SM skills necessary for achieving optimal health.
Modifiable factors that may mediate/moderate associations are also explored as potential intervention targets.
The involvement and roles of caregivers has specifically emerged as an important social determinant of patients’
health. An administrative ADRD supplement (LitCog IIIA) has expanded our inquiry by including interviews with
caregivers (informal or paid) involved in supporting the care of 60% of participants. In LitCog IV, we will create a
parallel caregiver cohort, with the secondary aims to 2) investigate associations between the presence of an
involved caregiver with treatment adherence, chronic disease outcomes, and functional health status among
older adults; 3) identify factors influencing associations between caregiver involvement and patient outcomes."
10848429,"Globally, approximately 15 million babies are born preterm each year and 1.1 million deaths are due to preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery of an infant before 37 post-menstrual weeks. Because mortality and morbidity rates are dependent upon gestational age, the very preterm neonate (<32 weeks gestation) is at the highest risk of developing complications that can result in death or significant life-long disability. Among the most significant and common of the major neonatal morbidities are intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). While measures of neonatal illness severity have been successful in predicting the risk for mortality in very preterm neonates, our ability to identify newborns likely to develop significant morbidity remains limited. Neonatal illness severity indices have a variety of important clinical and research applications including risk stratification, family counseling, external benchmarking for inter-hospital performance comparisons, and determining individual treatments for infants with a specific risk profile. Scoring systems are needed that not only predict mortality but also morbidity in the very preterm neonate. Our team has shown that metabolic status at the time of routine newborn screening is a novel predictor of neonatal morbidity and mortality in preterm newborns. Further work is needed to optimize these prediction models in very preterm neonates and quantify the ability of metabolites to act as strong, robust and potentially longitudinal biomarkers of neonatal illness severity. We hypothesize that metabolic biomarkers can be used to accurately predict the risk of a composite outcome in very preterm neonates that includes neonatal morbidity and in-hospital mortality. The objectives of our study are: Aim 1: Develop and externally validate metabolic models for predicting neonatal morbidity in very preterm newborns; and Aim 2: Evaluate dynamic metabolic models for predicting neonatal morbidity at multiple time points within the first week of life. The proposed work will examine metabolic predictors of neonatal morbidity and mortality in a retrospective sample of approximately 8,500 very preterm births from California and 1,500 very preterm births from Iowa. Furthermore, we will evaluate the ability of metabolites to predict neonatal morbidity and mortality at four critical time points within the first week of life in a prospective sample of 500 very preterm newborns receiving care in the NICU at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital (UCSF-BCH) and the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital (UI-SFCH). Understanding the relationship between specific metabolites and neonatal morbidity will lead to the long-term goal of improved diagnostics, more effective therapeutic agents, and a precision approach to clinical management of the very preterm neonate."

 CORE A, CORE LEAD: ALAN TALL
Cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
States and around the world. The overall application, “Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Atherosclerosis,”
seeks to investigate mechanisms of plaque stabilization and destabilization focused on novel functions of
vascular macrophages and stromal cells, and their crosstalk, in mouse models and human cardiovascular
diseases (CVD). The overarching theme is that inflammation and the efferocytosis-resolution cycle in
macrophages regulates plaque stability through crosstalk with other macrophages and stromal cells and that
detailed examination of the cell and molecular mechanisms may provide opportunities for novel CVD treatments,
including in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, an emerging CVD risk factor.
The overall program contains three highly integrated Projects, two Scientific Cores, one Administrative Core
(Core A), and two subcontracts to Dr. Jinjun Shi at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Projects 2 and 3). Core A
administers the overall PPG, and is responsible for the following services: A) centralized administrative actions
such as organizing productive scientific meetings; B) centralized financial record-keeping, including a monthly
report of expenditures for all program projects and cores, and all interactions with University Accounting and
Grants offices concerning grant budgets; C) preparing scientific and financial reports as required by the NHLBI
and Columbia; D) ensuring the highest level of PPG research through periodic internal and external advisory
committee review (twice and once per year, respectively); E) facilitating integration and harmonization among
program projects, including the use of shared resources, protocols, and joint experiments; and F) compliance
with all regulatory requirements, including for vertebrate animal research and human subjects research. Taken
together, the administrative services provided by Core A will yield efficient and optimal use of budget resources;
ensure regulatory compliance and the highest standards of ethical research, particularly research involving
vertebrate animals or human subjects; and enable productive, responsive, regularly-scheduled communication
and discussion among the PPG researchers, Project Leads, and Core Leads to help assess research progress
and carry out the overall Program."

The molecular mechanisms of synaptopathy that arise downstream of the large number of gene conferring risk
for these disorders remains unclear. Particularly, how different risk genes may segregate into common
molecular mechanisms has been challenging to identify. Likewise, how genetic missense variants result in
pathology remains an enigma. These gaps in knowledge pose a significant barrier to the field and limit our
ability to envision stratagies to ameliorate pathogenesis. In this project, we will develop and utilize innovative
proteomic, scRNA-seq, and genome engineering approaches to solve these problems at larger scales than
previously possible in animals. We anticipate these data will provide a new and unparalleled molecular

HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKER TRAINING PROGRAM
The Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (P2R) Consortium is comprised of dedicated experts in
safety disciplines critical to the nation's health and well-being. Guided by a shared vision – to reduce
work-related harm and improve disaster preparedness and response – and an external advisory board of
devoted and experienced professionals, the P2R Consortium serves as a resource for workers,
responders, and residents across the country with a targeted focus on the population of United States
Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Regions 5, 6, and 8. The objective of each
training course is (1) to reduce work-related harm and, therefore, is part of the Hazardous Waste Worker
Training Program, HWWTP, or (2) to improve disaster preparedness and response and, therefore, is part
of the HazMat Disaster Preparedness Training Program, HDPTP.
Building on past successes and using evidence-based techniques to identify high-risk industries and
communities, the Consortium's HWWTP projects an annual delivery of approximately 185 courses to
reach 3,008 workers for an impact of more than 17,000 hours of training. By delivering this training, the
public health impact of the P2R Consortium is a knowledgeable workforce and community with the skills
and confidence to recognize and mitigate hazards, thereby protecting health and well-being. Finally, as in
the past, the P2R Consortium places special emphasis on building the capacity of vulnerable
communities to respond to environmental and work-related threats."

 AFC has established networks for delivering high quality training to emergency responders in the
southeastern United States and to Native American tribes throughout the country. The proposed training
project would continue to take this training to communities with public safety agencies on tight budgets. This
program has a long history of doing the training at the community to eliminate the expense of sending the
trainees out to central training sites. AFC staff have learned how to build innovative portable training props and
accumulated enough equipment to conduct courses with a majority of time spent in hands-on activities with
real equipment and realism. The AFC campus boasts impressive resources of props and equipment to support
realistic large-scale exercises in hazmat response and in confined space rescue. Whether at home or on the
road, AFC instructors strive for realistic and effective training for the trainees.
 In nearly twenty years working with Native American communities, AFC has gained a reputation for
providing exciting and appropriate training to any tribe, even in small and remote locations. These tribes often
have responsibility for large areas of tribal lands and do not have large populations and resources. By
partnering with Native American Fish and Wildlife Society, AFC will continue to reach out to the tribes to offer
progressive levels of training to the tribal response teams. In this proposal, AFC plans to add hazardous waste
worker training that is important for protecting people who assess, sample, and remediate contaminated
environments.
 With Hazardous Waste Worker Training (HWWT) Program funds, AFC proposes to train over 1,865
Native American responders throughout the country and over 2,105 public safety responders in the southeast
US in a total of 210 courses and 80,120 contact hours. Additionally, AFC will support secondary training
conducted separately by trainees at their home tribes or agencies that will reach an additional 680 trainees in
80 classes for 7,280 contact hours. Total training with this component in the five-year grant is projected to be
290 classes for 5,050 trainees and 87,400 contact hours."
10857154,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While the academy excels in training scientists to conduct research, there is usually little opportunity for trainees
to learn and practice the professional skills that are essential to progressing and thriving in biomedical research
careers. To address this gap, The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), with IPERT support, developed The Whole
Scientist (TWS) program, which provides graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with professional skills
training to enhance their effectiveness and improve their success as members of the biomedical workforce. TWS
incorporates classroom learning with applied practica to help trainees develop aptitude and confidence in these
skills. Previous offerings of TWS were well received. We are now ready to increase the capacity and reach of
this program.
We will build on the previous TWS successes to broaden our curriculum using a novel thematic approach to skill
development, and to expand our geographic footprint by implementing TWS at institutions across the nation. We
will translate in-person TWS content into freely available online microcontent, for use in stand-alone professional
skills training, integration into graduate coursework, or self-directed learning. TWS microcontent will facilitate
implementation of TWS programming nationally, which will be enhanced by partnering with five geographically
dispersed institutions – one in each year of the grant. At these partner institutions, we will provide “train-the-
trainer” workshops for faculty and staff to support integration of TWS into their training curricula. The strategic
partner institutions will themselves become hubs for further dissemination of the curriculum and trainer training.
The TWS curriculum’s effectiveness at instilling professional skills and its impact on participants’ subsequent
careers will be evaluated at defined intervals. Feedback from participants and an advisory committee will
continue to guide further development of the program. Combined with formal and informal feedback from “train-
the-trainer” participants, we envision an adaptable and scalable training program that can be tailored to the
interests and needs of diverse graduate and/or postdoctoral scientists."

We propose the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative 2 (EDGI2), a new collaborative R01 in response to PAR-
23-050 Clinical Studies of Mental Illness. Its single-site predecessors, EDGI1 (R01 MH120170) and ARFID-GEN
(R56 MH129437) have been resoundingly successful. We now unite the four original EDGI1 sites with
exceptionally productive global new sites to advance genomic discovery across all major eating disorders (EDs)
to identify biologically, clinically, culturally, and therapeutically meaningful and actionable insights. Aim 1: EDGI2
extends our core business by increasing sample size, diversity, and ED phenotypes. Using our comprehensive
harmonized online assessment battery, we will phenotype and bio-sample 20,000 new participants with anorexia
nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
(ARFID), and controls. EDGI2 emphasizes co-production—with representatives from minoritized and
marginalized communities, we will ascertain 30% of samples from underrepresented groups. We will also over-
sample individuals with severe and enduring AN (SE-AN), whose DNA may be enriched for causative alleles.
Aim 2: We will apply statistical genetic analyses to explicate heterogeneity and biology of EDs by: conducting
standard GWAS analyses on diagnoses, trans-diagnostic behaviors, and continuous phenotypes including
polygenic risk score (PRS), and rare variant CNV analyses; identifying clinically meaningfully patient subsets;
and intensively evaluating our proposal that AN is a metabo-psychiatric disorders using LDSC, PRSet, pheWAS,
and Mendelian randomization to clarify direction of causation. Aim 3: We will evaluate the relative roles of genetic
and environmental risk and resilience factors to inform risk prediction by phenotypically characterizing cases and
controls with high and low PRS for EDs and then by genotypically characterizing those with severe ED
phenotypes. We will characterize distinct genetic or molecular groupings/patterns across cases and controls and
phenotypically characterize identified molecular subtypes. Aim 4: To determine where in the body EDs “live”, we
will identify brain cell types and anatomical regions implicated by genomic studies of EDs; predict genetically
regulated gene expression (GREx) in brain, gut, adipose, and other ED-relevant tissues; use snRNAseq atlases
to sharpen preliminary GTEx and TWAS analyses to identify brain cell types strongly implicated by the genomics
of each ED; expand to relevant non-brain cell types (e.g., adipose, muscle, liver, salivary); and use dynamic
GREx to model gene expression in ED-relevant contexts (e.g., sex, BMI, stress) enabling precise and
personalized modelling of gene expression. Aim 5: EDGI2 will culminate in a Translational Summit uniting
forward-thinking stakeholders from multiple sectors to develop a translational roadmap for evidence-based ED
prevention and treatment. EDGI2 will yield critical knowledge about genetic and environmental risk for EDs,
reveal mechanisms that potentiate or protect against genetic risk, and transition ED genetics from discovery to
clinical translation."
10857664,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals can modulate learning in response to differing internal and external environments. Layering context
onto learned information can enhance the diversity and specificity of memories, and can allow efficient access
to situation-specific behaviors. In state-dependent learning (SDL), information learned by an animal while it is
in a particular internal “state” is most effectively recalled when the animal is tested in the same internal state.
Drug intoxication-induced SDL can be observed across diverse animal species, including humans. We will
employ a model of ethanol intoxication-induced SDL that we have developed in the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans to define the molecular mechanisms that are required for SDL to occur. The simple and highly
conserved nervous system of C. elegans provides an excellent model in which to study the molecular events
that underlie SDL. When worms experience an attractive olfactory cue in the absence of food, they can learn to
associate the odorant with starvation and attenuate their response to it in a process called olfactory learning
(OL). We have shown that OL can become state-dependent; when animals undergo OL while they are
intoxicated, they only express the learned behavior when they are tested in the same intoxicated state. We
have shown that the internal intoxication state is encoded by a secreted peptide signal and its receptor during
OL, but, surprisingly, this signal does not encode intoxication state during recall of OL. Here, we will identify the
mechanisms by which state is encoded during recall of state-dependent OL. We will define the neural circuit in
which SDL occurs and the inputs into it that signal state during both learning and recall. We will distinguish
between two explanations for the lack of expression of state-dependent OL when the animals are tested in a
non-intoxicated state: forgetting (loss of the learned information) or failing to recall (the learned information
remains, but the memory is only accessible when the animals are intoxicated). We will determine if other drugs
besides ethanol can confer state-dependency on OL. Finally, we will probe the generalizability of SDL beyond
OL by asking if learning paradigms that use other neural circuits and signaling systems can become state
dependent. Successful completion of these aims will provide novel molecular insight into how context cues are
added to learned information."

We are seeking funding to procure an Aberrior FACILITY Line Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) super-
resolution microscope system. This equipment will bolster the research efforts of 13 NIH-funded scientists at the
University of Texas Health Sciences Center (UTHealth) in Houston and the MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC), spanning across six departments within the McGovern Medical School (MMS) at UTHealth and one
at MDACC. The instrument will introduce a unique, high-resolution multi-color nanoscopy capability to the MMS
and the broader Texas Medical Center, as the first of its kind in the region. The cutting-edge STED imaging
system can achieve up to 20 nm lateral (xy) and 70 nm axial (z) resolutions, maintaining these resolutions to a
depth of up to 80 μm into tissue samples. These features will provide our research community with unparalleled
nanoscale imaging, filling a crucial gap in our existing methodologies. Specifically, the microscope will be
invaluable for studies demanding high-resolution imaging of complex cellular and tissue structures at molecular
scales, where other super-resolution techniques often fall short. The Aberrior FACILITY Line attains excellent
resolution with its innovative easy3D STED technology, and its matrix detector array with over 20 avalanche
photodiodes improves image clarity by minimizing out-of-focus light; utilizes Adaptive Optics with a flexible mirror
to correct for lateral and axial optical aberrations resulting from refractive index variations within the sample; and
mitigates photobleaching through adaptive illumination that concentrates the excitation/depletion exclusively
where a signal is detected. The microscope will be housed in a dedicated room within the Center for Advanced
Microscopy, a UTHealth Shared Resource, located in the medical school building. The imaging core’s full-time
staff will facilitate maintenance and user training, supplemented by the FACILITY Line's auto-alignment feature
for optimal alignment of the excitation and STED depletion beams with the pinhole. The institution has pledged
to cover 10% of the instrument's purchase cost and 100% of the 5-year service contract cost. This support will
enable low fee-for-use operation, while maintaining at least 10% of peak usage availability for non-S10 users.
Additionally, up to 10% of usage will be allocated free of charge to support junior or un-funded investigators. The
investigators who stand to benefit from the proposed instrument are engaged in research spanning a wide range
of health and disease areas. Regardless of their focus, they all share a need to investigate biochemical
processes and molecular mechanisms at nanoscale, beyond the diffraction limit. The STED system will not only
further their innovative work, but also augment the suite of tools accessible to the broader research community,
thus enriching research pursuits at UTHealth Houston and the Texas Medical Center. In summary, we are
requesting funds to address a crucial deficiency in our current imaging capabilities - the lack of a system capable
of 3D nanoscopy and deep sample imaging. The instrument will serve as a state-of-the-art resource for the S10
Users, investigators throughout the MMS, and neighboring institutions on the Texas Medical Center campus."

 Specific genetic alterations in cancer cells may reprogram their metabolic networks and render them highly
dependent on particular nutrients for survival. A mechanistic understanding of nutrient dependency in cancer
cells has important implications for cancer treatment because drugs that impair nutrient metabolism may be
effective for killing cancer cells that depend on specific nutrients for survival while sparing normal cells. While
targeting nutrient dependency has been successful in leukemia, to date there has been limited success in
targeting nutrient dependency in solid tumors. Therefore, there is a significant need to understand the
mechanisms of action of anti-neoplastic agents that target nutrient dependency in cancer cells. SLC7A11 is an
amino acid transporter that enables cystine uptake and its subsequent conversion to cysteine, which is critical
for maintaining redox balance and cell survival. SLC7A11 is frequently overexpressed in human cancers,
including KEAP1-mutant lung cancers. This application aims to determine the roles and mechanisms of
SLC7A11 in regulating nutrient dependency and to therapeutically target nutrient dependency in cancers with
aberrant expression of SLC7A11. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To determine the metabolic mechanisms
underlying SLC7A11-induced glucose dependency in cancer cells. Specific Aim 2: To determine the therapeutic
potential of inhibiting GLUTs or the PPP in treating tumors with aberrant SLC7A11 expression. The rationale for
the proposed research is that studying the roles of SLC7A11 in regulating glucose dependency will not only
advance our mechanistic understanding of nutrient dependency in cancer cells but also provide important
insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target metabolic vulnerabilities in SLC7A11-
overexpressing tumors. Our proposed studies will have significant impact on both our understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of nutrient dependency and our ability to therapeutically target nutrient dependency in

arrays of electrodes implanted in the cortex to enable fast, accurate and intuitive control of
assistive technologies for individuals living with paralysis arising from spinal cord injury, stroke,
or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using an intracortical BCI, people with tetraplegia have
been able to use their imagined hand movements to command point-and-click actions on a
computer, type with a virtual keyboard, use communication apps such as chat, and browse the
web. Imagined movements have also been used to control assistive devices including the DEKA
prosthetic arm, assistive robotic arms and even one’s own paralyzed limb through patterned
electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles. Recent development of a miniature wireless signal
transmitter and a wireless, compact, battery-operated neural signal processor has raised the
potential for individuals with severe motor disability to use a wheelchair-mounted iBCI
independently at home without technical assistance. To be a viable assistive technology, the
iBCI must be not only mobile but also high-performance, reliable, and intuitive to use. This
research enhances all of these aspects of a mobile iBCI by translating algorithmic innovations
demonstrated in varied pre-clinical studies and optimizing them toward stable, high-performance
decoding in a mobile iBCI. This research first transforms a highly accurate and responsive
kinematic neural decoder (a deep learning recursive neural network) to run on the mobile iBCI’s
computationally powerful embedded hardware. To help stabilize kinematic decoding over time,
enhance performance, and ease calibration requirements, this research then looks to theories of
intrinsic neural manifolds to adapt dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques to high-
dimensional, multiscale human neural data. Next, state-of-the-art data science approaches are
integrated with multiclass analyses to promote reliable, accurate classification of a large set of
discrete hand gestures imagined by iBCI users. Next, DR methods are evaluated to disentangle
simultaneous kinematic and gesture decoding for smoother, more accurate and unperturbed
iBCI control. These cumulative approaches will be translated to embedded hardware form to run
on the powerful mobile processor to provide on-demand control of mobile and touch-enabled
devices using both mouse-like movements and gestures (such as swipe-to-scroll and pinch-to
zoom). Mapping unique gestures to additional functions will instantly activate key shortcuts or
gesture-to-phrase output. Using this wheelchair-mounted iBCI, a speech-disabled individual
could imagine a hand gesture to generate a text-to-speech greeting or call for help. Overall, this
research leverages state-of-the-art machine learning innovations toward a more capable,
reliable, and versatile iBCI to promote independence for people with severe motor disability."
10854782,"Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, disproportionately affects veterans. While often progressing
slowly, glaucoma can also progress rapidly, and especially given the variability of standard visual-field (VF) tests
to monitor progression, it currently can be challenging to determine those individuals needing a more aggressive
treatment plan. Veterans may experience permanent loss of vision (and corresponding vision-related quality of
life) while waiting for subsequent tests to show VF loss progression (and thus indicating a change in treatment
is needed). Structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures, such as the thickness of the macular
ganglion cell layer (GCL), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and optic disc morphology can also be used to help
monitor progression. However, existing clinical use of global parameters to assess glaucoma progression may
be insensitive to worsening of focal defects. It is also not known how differing spatial patterns of progression
affects quality of life. There is an unmet clinical need for simple-to-use approaches to more accurately estimate
future progression and corresponding quality-of-life measures. We will use a specific type of deep-learning
approach, called deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) to provide a novel standardized and sensitive approach
to monitoring glaucomatous progression, comparable to a glaucoma expert. Our specific aims are as follows:
 1. Evaluate how well image-based deep-learning variational autoencoder (VAE) models can be used
 to monitor a patient’s current glaucomatous progression. This aim will first involve training and
 evaluating a separate deep VAE model for each image-based structure of interest as well as a deep VAE
 model for 24-2 visual field threshold data. Once trained, each VAE model will allow for the extraction of the
 so-called latent variable values given the input image. The ability of these latent variable values to monitor
 change over time will be compared (in an independent test set) to standard global and regional parameters.
 Because of their ability to naturally capture both global and local changes, the latent-variable approach will
 be able to better detect changes over time compared to current clinical reports.
2. Evaluate how well image-based deep-learning variational autoencoder (VAE) models can be used
 to predict a patient’s future glaucomatous progression. In this aim, we will first develop an approach
 for predicting future latent-variable representations of structure/function based on learning from a prior time
 series of values. Once determined, future latent values will be mapped back to their original
 structure/function representations using the trained “decoder” part of the VAE. Such an approach will
 provide a clear advantage for a clinician in having visual spatial representations of future structure and
 function trajectories to optimize early treatment decisions.
3. Evaluate how latent variables from a novel binocular VAE model relate to visual quality-of-life
 measures. In this aim, we will first develop an additional VAE model to take into account binocular vision
 (what the patient sees with both eyes open) and then relate latent factors from each model to quality-of-
 life measures in a cross-sectional fashion. We hypothesize that binocular VAE models of structure and
 function will be more predictive of visual quality-of-life measures than current methods, helping to
 prioritize and guide treatment.
Successful completion of these aims is expected to have positive impact to help veteran glaucomatous
patients avoid permanent vision loss at an early disease stage and maintain vision-related quality of life."

The Postdoctoral Training Program in Hepatology is an integral part of the comprehensive hepatology research
program at UCSF. The purpose of the program is to provide trainees a solid background in liver biology and
disease and the investigational skills to address new questions and contribute to new knowledge in hepatology.
The program is staffed by 16 faculty based within the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics and
Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences; collectively these individuals offer balanced expertise in basic and
clinical hepatology and have a strong track record of working collaboratively with each other. A subgroup of six
program faculty comprise a Steering Committee charged with screening and selecting applicants, reviewing the
training curriculum and monitoring the progress of active trainees. An External Advisory Board provides
independent counsel. At the recruitment stage, faculty preceptors are trained to use holistic methods to screen
and select applicants in an equitable fashion. Faculty in charge of admitted trainees are educated in mentoring
best practices, including mentoring across differences. For the trainees themselves, the program prioritizes
structured individual development plans and encourages the use of mentoring teams that include career and
content mentors. The postdoctoral training plan begins with a foundational core curriculum covering liver biology,
liver-related research methods and general academic skills. Formal instruction in rigor, reproducibility and
responsible conduct of research is required. Along with this, trainees pursue specialized research instruction in
a selected topic area ranging from clinical epidemiology and health outcomes cell biology, immunology,
metabolism and fibrosis/carcinogenesis. Focused scientific coursework is available to all trainees if desired; for
those pursuing clinical investigation who do not have an advanced degree, enrollment in a Master’s Degree
program is mandatory. Commensurate with scientific training, postdocs receive support for career development
to facilitate their transition to independence. Importantly, the T32 program benefits from the rich research and
training infrastructure at UCSF that encompasses an array of core facilities as well as a wealth of resources for
trainee wellness and personal/professional support. Key among these are the UCSF Liver Center, the Clinical
and Translational Science Institute, the Office of Diversity and Outreach and the Office of Career and
Professional Development. Our program faculty are strong figures in several of these units, and accordingly they
can guide trainees to utilize the resources to maximize the value of their postdoctoral experience. The ultimate
goal of the training program is to provide sufficient group and individual mentorship to enable graduates to
assume a faculty-level position and compete successfully for independent research funding in hepatology."

 In the United States, nearly half of pregnancies are unintended, and unintended pregnancies occur five times
more often among poor women compared to affluent women. The proposed project investigates how providing
access to free contraceptives impacts unintended pregnancy and, ultimately, the lives of children—both children
whose births are unintended and their older siblings who may lose resources (both material resources and time)
as a result of a mother’s unintended pregnancy.
 The proposed project significantly expands the scope of Michigan Contraceptive Access, Research, and
Evaluation Study (M-CARES), a large-scale, randomized control trial that provides no-cost access to any type
of contraception and tracks women longitudinally in surveys and rich, administrative data. The proposed project
aims to:
 (1). Double the M-CARES recruitment period and increase the sample of children born before the
 intervention that are in the study by 1,000;
 (2). Develop and field two survey supplements (year 2 and year 4 post enrollment) of M-CARES
 participants to ask about (a) intendedness of each birth (pre- and post-intervention), (b) time and
 money spent on each child, (c) parenting practices, and (d) children’s health, schooling, extra-
 curricular activities, behavior and well-being;
 (3). Compile comprehensive longitudinal data using surveys (aim 2) and administrative records to
 document the outcomes of the children of M-CARES participants in (a) the short-term (5-year study
 period) and (b) long-term (until children reach age 18); and
 (4). Evaluate the causal effects of mothers’ access to free contraception on children’s outcomes in survey data
 (aims 2a-d) and administrative records (3a), including heterogeneity analyses by income, race, and
education.
 Achieving these aims will contribute to social science and public health policy by providing novel experimental
evidence on the understudied, intergenerational effects of making contraception free to women within the existing
U.S. public health system. This study will, therefore, contribute to a larger cost-benefit analysis of a feasible and
easy to implement reproductive health intervention—an intervention that potentially helps break the cycle of
poverty and improve children’s life-time opportunities."
10854889,"ABSTRACT
microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to promote cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction. However,
current miRNA delivery methods, such as viral vectors or lipid formulations, present safety concerns for
widespread use. We have developed an injectable thermo-responsive hydrogel functionalized with carbon
nanotubes (RTG-CNT) for the delivery of miRNAs. The RTG-CNT hydrogel transitions from a liquid-solution to
a gel-based matrix shortly after reaching body temperature allowing for a liquid-based delivery rapidly followed
by a stable-gel miRNA localization. Moreover, this hydrogel has improved short-term (8-week) biocompatibility
compared to viral and lipid approaches and it promotes two-fold more miRNA expression than lipid formulations.
In this investigation, we propose to test the hypothesis that our novel RTG-CNT hydrogel is far superior
delivery model of miRNAs to the heart, through increased biocompatibility, targeted delivery and higher
miRNA expression when compared to viral and lipid approaches. We will address our hypothesis with a
combination of cell biology and bioengineering by 1) Quantify the biocompatibility and the magnitude of improved
localization of our RTG-CNT-miRNA delivery system over liposomal and viral vectors approaches, 2) Measure
the improved efficiency of the RTG-CNT hydrogel as pro-regenerative miRNA delivery system vs. liposomal and
viral vector deliveries in a mouse MI model and 3) Determine the potential of the RTG-CNT hydrogel to deliver
anti-fibrotic miRNAs to further improve myocardial structure and rescue function in a mouse MI model. We
believe that the RTG-CNT hydrogel will offer a more biocompatible and far more efficient miRNA delivery system
than traditional approaches, that can be realistically translated into clinical applications."
10836042,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The mechanisms regulating high blood pressure (BP) and kidney injury and dysfunction are known to
have a strong genetic component; however, the specific genes involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension
and renal disorders are not well defined. The key regulators are atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP,
BNP), signaling through natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA) and the second messenger cGMP. There is a
strong association of polymorphisms in the genes that encode ANP (Nppa), BNP (Nppb), and NPRA (Npr1)
with high BP and cardiovascular disorders in humans. It is not clear how the lack of Npr1 in the specific cell-
types of the kidney might progressively lead to high BP and renal disorders, nor what underlies the sex-specific
differences in the disease etiologies. The genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involving transcription factors
(TFs) and modified histone codes, respectively, which regulate the pathogenesis of high BP and kidney injury
and dysfunction are not well understood. The preliminary and published results have provided the intriguing
evidence that retinoic acid receptor-α (RAR-α) agonists enhance the transcription and expression of Npr1 and
receptor signaling; however, angiotensin II (Ang II) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) repress
Npr1 transcription and receptor function in primary cultured renal cells. These stimulating and inhibiting
hormones also govern genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression and regulation by interacting
actions of TFs and histone codes; however, their roles in modulating gene transcription and signaling in
hypertension and kidney disorders are not well understood. The overall objective of the current proposal is to
determine how the hormonal control mechanisms influence the genetic and epigenetic factors that govern the
Npr1 and receptor function, regulating high BP and kidney injury and dysfunction in a sex-specific manner. The
central hypothesis is that Npr1 expression and receptor signaling is reciprocally regulated by genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms, and that the loss of cell-specific Npr1 in nephron tubules and podocytes will trigger
high BP and kidney injury and disorders. The proposed specific aims will test the hypotheses: 1) determine the
mechanisms that repress Npr1 expression and receptor signaling leading to high BP and kidney damage and
disorders, 2) delineate the mechanisms those enhance Npr1 expression and receptor signaling and decrease
high BP and kidney injury and dysfunction, and 3) delineate the interactive mechanisms those impact the
divergent stimulatory and inhibitory factors regulating the paradigm shift in high BP and kidney injury and
dysfunction. The findings of the completed studies should lead to the identification of much-needed new
molecular biomarkers and therapies for the treatment and prevention of high BP and kidney diseases in a
gender-specific manner in humans."

The Baylor College of Medicine Genomic Center for Infectious Diseases (GCID) proposal seeks to provide a
comprehensive, large scale genomics program for NIAID with the goal of enhancing our understanding of host
and microbiome interactions related to infectious disease genomics. In this TMC-GCID renewal proposal, the
Sequencing Analysis and Resource Dissemination (SARD) Core will deliver most cost effective and efficient
ways to generate high quality metagenomic and transcriptomic data, and genome assemblies for the four TMC-
GCID research projects: Bacteria, Virus, Fungi, and Parasite. The SARD Core brings together sequencing and
analytical expertise in human genetics and large-scale genomics from the Human Genome Sequencing Center
(HGSC) with microbial, viral, and metagenomics experience from the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and
Microbiome Research (CMMR). Large heterogeneous datasets will be generated, evaluated, and characterized
using new and proven sequencing and analytical methods to further our understanding of how polymorphisms
(host or microbe) contribute to mechanisms of pathogenesis. Advances in high-throughput next generation
sequencing (NGS) such as the development of viral capture enrichment pipelines, host RNA-Seq have facilitated
studies of the microbiome and host susceptibility genetics. Advances in long-read sequencing contribute to
higher quality full-length parasite and bacterial genome assemblies; the bacterial reference genome datasets
have facilitated establishment of competitive infection studies (SUMMIT) among closely related strains. New
approaches, such as single cell RNA sequencing, have enabled a more discrete examination of the cellular
response to infection and the transduction of signals from an infected cell to adjacent cells. In the current
proposal, we will continue to advance the existing NGS applications, while also leveraging new sequencing
technologies such as PacBio Revio to deliver long read assemblies at lower cost, support MAS-ISO-seq to
deliver full-length transcripts and isoforms. The Oxford Nanopore (ONT) platform will enable novel sequencing
applications for low biomass samples (e.g. ONT Adaptive sampling). While new sequencing platforms (e.g.
Element AVITI) or new methodology, e.g. MERFISH for single cell spatial transcriptomics and the antibody-
based Olink platform for targeted protein profiling, will be evaluated for their use across our research projects.
Multiple cost reduction strategies are also proposed. The SARD Core will be responsible for supporting the
program by managing sample tracking via LIMS, data management, data analysis and data dissemination and
focus on bioinformatic tool developments that seek to optimize existing protocols, as well as create new
workflows in response to new sequencing technologies and molecular techniques. All resulting data and tools
will be made available to the wider GCID and NIAID scientific community."
10851083,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overview: The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of a novel digital application (app) for improving
quality of life (QOL) and psychological outcomes in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Background: Patients newly diagnosed with AML confront a sudden and life-threatening diagnosis, requiring
an immediate disruption of their life and an urgent 4-6-week hospitalization to initiate intensive chemotherapy.
During this hospitalization, they endure substantial physical symptoms due to the side-effects of chemotherapy,
which negatively impact their QOL. Importantly, patients also experience immense psychological distress as
they struggle with the abrupt onset of illness, uncertainty regarding their prognosis, physical and social isolation
during hospitalization, and complete loss of independence. Despite the well-described psychological sequalae
patients with AML experience, interventions to support them during this challenging hospitalization are limited.
Moreover, limited availability of palliative care and mental health clinicians further hinders the scalability and
dissemination of supportive care interventions to address the needs of all patients with AML. We developed a
self-administered novel digital app (DREAMLAND) for patients with AML undergoing intensive chemotherapy.
DREAMLAND includes four modules that focus on: 1) supportive psychotherapy to help patients adjust to the
shock of diagnosis; 2) psychoeducation to manage illness expectations; 3) psychosocial skill-building to promote
effective coping; and 4) self-care. We recently completed a pilot randomized trial demonstrating the feasibility of
DREAMLAND and its promising efficacy for improving patient-reported QOL, anxiety and depression symptoms,
as well as self-efficacy and symptom burden, compared to usual care. Based on these findings, DREAMLAND
received an FDA Breakthrough Device Designation as a promising digital therapeutic for AML.
Research Plan: We propose to conduct a multi-site randomized trial of DREAMLAND versus CERENA (a phys-
ical health promotion control app) in 200 patients with AML undergoing intensive chemotherapy to test the effi-
cacy of DREAMLAND for improving patient-reported outcomes in a large and more diverse patient population.
We will also assess the impact of DREAMLAND on patients’ long-term QOL and psychological outcomes as well
as explore mediators and moderators of the intervention effect on patient-reported QOL.
Environment: This project will be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke Cancer Center, and Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. These sites have the supportive care research and leukemia experience,
infrastructure, and processes to conduct this trial. The MGH research team has the expertise in developing and
testing palliative, supportive care, and digital health interventions for patients with solid tumors and hematologic
malignancies to ensure the successful implementation of this trial across all study sites.
Relevance of Research: Data from this project will be used to obtain FDA approval for DREAMLAND as a
digital therapeutic that can be prescribed to address the immense needs of patients with AML."

Chronic pain and opioid misuse are two intertwined health crises in the US. We know more about how chronic
pain develops than how it naturally resolves. Our hypothesis is that the disruption of endogenous pro-resolution
mechanisms causes chronic pain, and targeting these mechanisms can lead to more effective and safe pain
treatment. Our grant proposal entitled ""Cellular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential of NR4A1 in Pain
Resolution"" aims to investigate the nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (NR4A1) as an endogenous
mediator for pain resolution. Evidence suggests that NR4A1 limits inflammation and restores homeostasis in
various diseases. However, its role in pain is unknown. In our preliminary studies, we discovered that NR4A1 is
expressed in macrophages and increases during the resolution phase of in a mouse model of postoperative
pain. Furthermore, we demonstrated that lack of NR4A1 expression results in chronic postoperative pain,
whereas its activation accelerates recovery from postoperative pain. Thus, we hypothesize that NR4A1 in
monocytes/macrophages is essential for pain resolution and limits chronic pain, and as a peripheral and
endogenous mechanism may offer a more effective and safer therapeutic target for the treatment of pain. We
have three specific aims to test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will test whether NR4A1 in macrophages controls
the resolution of inflammation and postoperative pain induced by plantar incision in mice. Specific Aim2 will test
the hypothesis that natural and FDA-approved NR4A1 agonists promote pain resolution without major liabilities.
Specific Aim3 aims to test whether NR4A1 regulates the release of the secreted protein 1 (SPP1), a potential
biological and functional biomarker for NR4A1 target engagement and pain resolution. Successfully achieving
our specific aims is highly significant for the HEAL initiative because it will reveal new endogenous mechanisms
of pain resolution and provide a translational validation of NR4A1 as a new, non-addictive, therapeutic target for
two pain conditions at high risk of opioid abuse: postoperative pain and low back pain. Additionally, we will reveal
SPP1 as a novel biological and functional biomarker for future testing and improve of multiple NR4A1 agonists
aiming to prevent and treat chronic pain."

 Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is one of the most deadly types of colorectal cancer (CRC) that
causes the most morbidity and mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The early detection
of dysplastic or malignant lesions in patients with ulcerative colitis is challenging, which resulted in delayed
diagnosis and limited therapeutic efficacy of CAC. Bile acids (BAs), as early dietary sensors, are critical
mediators of gut physiology, partly by affecting their master receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) 's activity.
BAs overproduction is implicated in diarrhea associated with IBD and CAC, with which the function of FXR is
severely compromised. The BAs-FXR axis is a convergent point of genetic and dietary risk factors of CRC. In
addition, FXR is a crucial modulator of the pro-and anti-inflammatory responses in the intestinal epithelium.
Intestinal macrophages constitute the largest pool of macrophages in the body and have emerged as crucial
sentinels for gut microbiome and metabolite recognition. However, due to the exceptional plasticity of gut
macrophages during cancer progression, there is a major lack of mechanistic understanding of how gut
macrophages sense BAs and how FXR regulates gut macrophages’ function, and mediate its interaction with
other cell types in CAC. Our preliminary studies revealed that epithelium damage and intestinal inflammation
resulted in the loss of BAs homeostasis and compromised FXR signaling in CAC mice models. Our overarching
hypothesis is the dysregulated BAs-FXR axis further induces pathological immune landscape changes,
especially in macrophages, which crosstalked with Th17 cells, together promoting tumorigenesis. This proposal
aims to evaluate the mechanisms of action (MOA) of FXR agonism including FDA-approved Obeticholic acid
(OCA) on gut macrophages’ differentiation and function in vitro and in vivo, including expansion of animal testing
to delineate breadth of this anti-cancer efficacy on both colitis and CAC, as an immunomodulator drug. Three
specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will investigate the impact of inflammation- and tumor-induced, host- and
microbial-derived BAs on macrophage and its crosstalk to T cell and intestinal stem cells. Aim 2 will investigate
the gut macrophges’ dependence on FXR in modulating its function in CAC mice model. Aim3 of this proposal
will determine the therapeutic utility of activation of FXR in gut macrophage for the treatment of CAC. Besides,
we will also validate the combination therapies to maximize the efficacy of cancer treatments including rational
combinations of anti-IL23 and FXR agonists. We believe investigating the role of the BAs-FXR axis in
inflammation-induced and tumor-infiltrated Macrophages will facilitate our understanding of the etiology of colitis-
induced colon cancer. The proposed study of FXR ligands will hasten the development of novel therapeutics for
this debilitating and most lethal colorectal cancer."

Functional disability profoundly impacts the health and health care use of older adults, and yet functional status
is not consistently monitored by health systems, nor routinely collected by Medicare. Patients and their families
frequently struggle with inadequate support for these unrecognized needs. While specific diseases or
multimorbidity have traditionally been the focus of research investigating high and potentially burdensome
health care use, disability, defined as needing help performing activities of daily living (ADLs), may be a more
critical and universal factor. The relationship between disability and health care use is complex: medical
conditions may result in both disability and health care use, disability and unmet care needs can lead to health
care use, and hospitalization itself can cause disability. Variation in health system features and practice
patterns, such as the numbers of hospital beds and local levels of health care intensity, impact care patterns at
a regional level and may influence the relationship between disability and health care use. Nationally, the
Medicare Advantage (MA) program is rapidly expanding and offers increasing flexibility in supplemental
benefits that could better support older adults with disability. However, older adults with functional disability are
more likely leave MA plans and may receive care from lower quality skilled nursing facilities and home health
agencies in MA. It is unknown if MA plans are shifting care from facilities to the community and to unpaid
caregivers in order to reduce costs. The Paul Beeson Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging
will support my effort to address this gap through research that will examine the relationship between disability
and health care use at three levels: the individual, health system, and health policy. In SA1, I will investigate
the individual-level heterogeneity of health care use after the first report of ADL disability using the Medicare
claims-linked National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), which allows for identification of the month of
disability onset. In SA2, I will use the Health and Retirement Study and data capturing regional characteristics
to assess the influence of regional health system features on health care use after disability. In SA3, I will use
NHATS linked to Medicare data to examine differences in care setting (i.e., community vs. institutional care)
and caregiving (i.e., paid and unpaid caregiving) between older adults with functional disability in MA vs.
traditional Medicare. These scientific aims link closely with a comprehensive development plan through which I
will gain advanced methodological expertise in trajectory analysis and hierarchical modeling, clinical and
systems understanding in geriatric disability, health economics and policy insight, and the leadership skills to
translate my findings to policy change. This five-year project leverages my extensive experience conducting
survey-based research, the resources of my institution, and the expertise of my mentors to identify
opportunities to improve the care of older adults while catalyzing my development as an independent
researcher working to improve Medicare policy for older adults with functional disability."

The concept of synthetic lethality has been validated clinically with the use of PARP inhibitors in treating
breast cancers with loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1/2. Nevertheless, only 5-10% of breast tumors are
caused by inherited mutations in BRCA1/2, highlighting a need to identify new synthetic lethal interactions that
can be exploited clinically. In this proposal, we capitalize on our recent discovery of a new synthetic lethal
interaction that is exposed by a cancer-specific genetic alteration.
Centrosomes are microtubule-organizing centers that catalyze the assembly of the mitotic spindle during cell
division. Centrosome duplication is tightly coupled to cell cycle progression and controlled by the master
regulatory kinase (Polo-like kinase 4) PLK4. Chemical inhibition of PLK4 activity leads to cell division in the
absence of centrosome duplication, producing centrosome-less cells that exhibit delayed mitotic spindle
assembly. Although most cancer cells can proliferate in the absence of centrosomes, we recently discovered
that inhibition of PLK4 leads to centrosome depletion that selectively triggers mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells
overexpressing TRIM37. This has therapeutic relevance as the TRIM37 chromosomal locus is amplified in 50-
60% of neuroblastomas and ~10% of breast cancers. In addition, amplification of this region is associated with
aggressive cancers with highly rearranged and unstable genomes. In this application, we will define how
TRIM37 overexpression promotes tumorigenesis and increases the vulnerability to PLK4 inhibitors. We will
also test the effectiveness of PLK4 inhibition in achieving selective killing of human cancer organoids
with TRIM37 amplification.
Aim 1 will determine how TRIM37 overexpression increases the sensitivity to PLK4 inhibitors and test if
TRIM37-driven centrosome dysfunction contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting mitotic errors. The 17q23
amplicon contains ~30 genes, including TRIM37 and the TP53-antagonizing phosphatase PPM1D. The
oncogenic properties of PPM1D overexpression have been validated in several models. Selective PPM1D
inhibitors have been developed, but how PPM1D cooperates with other genes encoded in the 17q23 amplicon
remains unknown. In Aim 2, we determine if PPM1D overexpression promotes TRIM37-mediated genomic
instability and test if PPM1D inhibition can potentiate the action of PLK4 inhibitors in these tumors. Finally, Aim
3 will examine if TRIM37 overexpression confers increased sensitivity to PLK4 inhibition in breast and
neuroblastoma tumor organoids. Understanding the role of TRIM37 in tumorigenesis will help define how its
overexpression drives the development of aggressive cancers and provide a rationale for the use of PLK4i in
the treatment of cancers with genomic amplification of TRIM37."

Hypertension is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and premature mortality globally and is a major driver
of the rising burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Hypertension can be
controlled with highly efficacious, cost-effective medications; however, of the over 100 million people with
hypertension in SSA, 10% or fewer have controlled blood pressure, with similar low rates of control among
people with HIV. There is a strong commitment both in SSA and globally to improve treatment for hypertension
and other CVD risk factors by ensuring medication supply, by leveraging the HIV chronic care model, and via
primary health system strengthening. As hypertension diagnosis and medication availability improve, strategies
are needed to increase patient-centeredness of chronic hypertension care models in order to engage patients in
the long-term care required to reduce CVD risk and achieve optimal health outcomes.
In this K23 proposal, my overall scientific objective is to assess, and test interventions that overcome, patient-
level barriers to hypertension treatment adherence in a chronic HIV-hypertension care model in Kenya. This
proposal is nested within the NIH-funded SEARCH SAPPHIRE trial (U01AI150510) evaluating integrated
hypertension-HIV care in East Africa. In Aim 1, I will use a theory-informed mixed methods approach to evaluate
barriers to hypertension treatment adherence within the SEARCH integrated hypertension-HIV care model. In
Aim 2, I will conduct a discrete choice experiment to assess patient preferences for strategies to improve care
delivery, using findings to develop an implementation strategy to improve patient-centered hypertension care. In
Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of this implementation strategy.
My overall training objective is to develop expertise in implementation science approaches to improve the patient-
centeredness and effectiveness of integrated care models for hypertension and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. My
research aims map to my specific training objectives to: (1) develop expertise in hypertension and CVD clinical
research, (2) learn mixed methods applications in implementation science, (3) learn implementation science
methods for intervention development and evaluation. This K23 proposal is responsive to NHLBI Strategic
Objective 6, to optimize clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease. My
proposed training and research aims will equip me with the necessary skills to achieve my long-term goal of
becoming an independent NIH-funded investigator with expertise in implementation science methods to improve
CVD and HIV outcomes. Findings generated from this proposal will inform an NIH R01 application to test a multi-
component strategy for improving hypertension treatment outcomes among people with and without HIV in SSA."
10862340,"Exposure therapy is the most effective evidence-based treatment for a variety of anxiety disorders, but relapse
is common. Failures of exposure therapy can be explained in part by laboratory studies using aversive
conditioning and extinction, where the extinction phase can be viewed as a model of exposure therapy. These
studies show that the “safe” association learned during extinction is tenuous, and the original negative
association can sometimes return – a process known as spontaneous recovery. Recent work from our group
shows that during extinction, some participants update the original association from fear to safety while others
remember the fear association. The latter participants show spontaneous recovery (relapse) of fear at a later test.
The overall goal of Project 3 is to understand these individual differences in spontaneous recovery, their
relationship to transdiagnostic mental health symptoms of anxiety and to generalized anxiety disorder, and
their neural underpinnings. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage the computational framework of latent
cause inference; according to this framework, spontaneous recovery arises when an old latent cause associated
with an aversive outcome is inferred to be active in a harmless situation, a form of overgeneralization. We will
fit a model (from Core C) to behavior of individual participants to precisely quantify individual differences in
the computational process underlying spontaneous recovery and correlate these to symptoms. We will also
identify the neurocognitive systems that are implicated in this overgeneralization: we hypothesize that
participants show spontaneous recovery because of deficient memory-control processes – these participants
are failing to suppress retrieval of the original memory, even in the presence of evidence that the situation is
now “safe”. We will relate this to clinical symptoms: based on prior work, we hypothesize that spontaneous
recovery will be associated with low memory-control ability and high clinical symptoms of anxiety.
Using Core B, Aim 3.1 will test for relationships between memory control, spontaneous recovery, anxiety
symptoms and parameters of latent cause inference, taking a dimensional approach in a large-scale online
study and also comparing a clinical sample with generalized anxiety disorder to healthy controls. Aim 3.2 will
leverage Core D to identify the neural correlates of spontaneous recovery using multivariate predictive
modeling of fMRI, focusing on brain networks previously established to relate to memory control, and also
using data-driven methods to identify new biomarkers. Last, Aim 3.3 will causally test our hypotheses about
brain networks that mediate spontaneous recovery by intervening on these networks with real-time fMRI
neurofeedback, with the goal of reducing spontaneous recovery in individuals who are prone to it. Taken
together, these studies will substantially advance our understanding of why spontaneous recovery occurs and
how it relates to clinical symptoms; this, in turn, can inform our treatment of anxiety disorders by helping us
identify who is most likely to relapse after exposure therapy, and how we might intervene to prevent relapse."
10862341,"Project 4 – Neural mechanisms of latent cause inference: the role of orexin signaling
The goal of Project 4 is to identify and manipulate neural substrates of experience-dependent latent cause
inference to help “unlearn” previously learned associations. This is important because unlearning of
maladaptive behavior is critical in many psychotherapies; however, relapse of old learning is common. Here,
we will focus on neural activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) during exposure to new
information regarding rewards as a substrate for affecting whether old information is “overwritten” by new
experiences and attempt to modify this activity (and consequent behavioral choices) using the neuropeptide
orexin/hypocretin system. Orexins are hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate arousal and motivation, and
play an important role in the formation of memories and in reward-mediated learning.
We hypothesize that orexin -- by reactivating reward memory during devaluation or extinction -- can tilt the
balance from ascribing new devaluation/extinction information to a separate latent cause (a two-cause model
that does not overwrite the old association) to incorporating this information within the old latent cause (a
one-cause model).
We will use high density unit recordings in CeA to monitor reactivation of a reward
memory as an index of an inferred latent cause. We will use orexin antagonism or chemogenetics to test a
causal role of orexin signaling in latent cause inference during reward devaluation by LiCl malaise in a
Pavolvian paradigm (Aim 4.1), or by extinction of lever pressing for sucrose in an instrumental paradigm
(Aim 4.2).
Together, these studies will identify circuitry involved in latent cause mechanisms for Pavlovian
and instrumental behaviors using parallel approaches: devaluation to challenge existing latent causes (using
either LiCl malaise in Aim 4.1, or extinction in Aim 4.2), and recordings from CeA as well as activation of
orexin signaling to identify sites of action for modulation of latent causes. We have engaged consultants, Geoff
Schoenbaum and Angela Langdon who are experts in computational and animal studies of latent cause
inference, to help advise on this Project.
This Project uses the Center latent cause inference framework, and specifically, the model developed by Core
C. Findings from this Project will suggest new therapeutic approaches to mitigating compulsive behaviors
with deleterious consequences (see P2) and reducing relapse of anxiety after extinction-based psychotherapy
(see P3). Brain-wide neuroimaging findings from P1, and the findings of P2 and P3, will therefore dovetail
with our investigations in P4, and all Projects will benefit from close interactions."
10862342,"CORE B – Behavioral testing and clinical assessment
The overarching aim of Core B is to provide a harmonized infrastructure for human subjects research in
support of Projects P1-P3. Each of these projects proposes to dissect the process of latent cause inference in
human health and mental illness by probing multiple behavioral signatures of this process in: categorization
tasks (P1), event segmentation tasks (P1), and learning tasks such probabilistic decision making (P2) and
extinction (P3; paralleling work proposed in the animal project, P4). The goal of Core B is to facilitate
behavioral testing so as to optimally measure our constructs of interest at the level of individual phenotypes:
each participant's computational latent cause inference phenotype and clinical mental health symptom
phenotype. We aim to streamline recruitment of all study samples (clinical and non-clinical) and deployment
of experiment software for remote testing, so as to remove the traditional recruitment and clinical evaluation
bottlenecks characteristic of this type of research.
Towards these goals, we will make use of and expand on existing infrastructure. We will develop a Center-
specific instantiation of NivTurk, our software application for serving remote experiments to participants
effectively and efficiently, and expand its capabilities to enhance scientific rigor and use with potential
participants of varying cognitive abilities and backgrounds (Aim 1). We will also expand the scope and reach
of the Rutgers-Princeton Center for Computational Cognitive NeuroPsychiatry (CCNP), a clinical research
center co-directed by Core Leads Konova and Niv that is dedicated to computational psychiatry research, by
building a research registry of pre-screened and clinically assessed potential participants with the conditions of
interest in the planned research studies (Aim 2). In addition, we will develop and standardize a reliable battery
of cognitive tasks that will allow all studies in the Center to control for covariates of no interest (Aim 3), and in
consultation with clinical staff at the CCNP, a battery of psychiatric self-report instruments (Aim 4). These
tools and standards will unify assessments across the Center, enhancing rigor and reproducibility of all Center
studies in humans, and allowing for cross-study and cross-Project analyses in Core C.
Importantly, to ensure that research in the Center is conducted in a way that is respectful, inclusive, and
ethical, and following recent guidelines for mental health research, we will consult with an advisory board of
people with lived experience with the psychopathologies that are the focus of the Center (anxiety, OCD,
alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia) in shaping the products of Aims 1, 3 and 4.
Through accomplishing its aims, Core B will provide an unprecedented infrastructure for the proposed
Projects, as well as a valuable resource for future large-scale clinical computational psychiatric studies,
including in remote, nationally representative samples and treatment focused, longitudinal studies."
10862343,"CORE C – Computational Modeling Core
The computational modeling core will provide computational model development and model-based data
analysis tools for all the Projects in the Center. A central approach of this Center, and of much work in
computational psychiatry, is the use of formal computational models to quantify otherwise abstract functions
and connect them to basic neural and cognitive mechanisms. All of the Center's projects concern a class of
computational models known as latent cause inference, which describe how humans and animals cluster their
experiences so as to identify different underlying contexts in which different rules apply. Such inference has
important effects on learning and decision making, and we hypothesize that dysfunction in these processes is
implicated in numerous mental illnesses. A key approach for formalizing and testing such hypotheses across
all our Projects is estimating the free parameters of the latent cause model: a set of interpretable “knobs” that
directly control the behavior of the model. Thus, from an individual's behavior or brain measurements, we can
determine the model parameters that best explain the data, and test whether these differ in psychopathology.
To support this approach, the Computational Modeling Core has three aims. The first is to develop a single,
uniform latent cause model appropriate to the tasks and experimental measurements across all the Projects.
The second aim is to build data analysis tools to fit this model to multivariate, multimodal experimental
datasets. This involves estimating the model's parameters both for each individual and, using hierarchical
modeling techniques, at the group-level and for condition averages. These estimates allow us to conduct
statistical tests such as whether the model's parameters are different between healthy and clinical groups or
whether the parameters change in a graded fashion with symptoms. Our third aim is to develop tools to
estimate graded dimensions of psychopathology (e.g., depression, anxiety) from self-report psychiatric
symptom data collected in the Projects. For this, we will use modern hierarchical factor analysis techniques to
characterize accurately the separate dimensions of illness, while coping with high levels of comorbidity
between them.
By concentrating modeling infrastructure in a single Core, all Center Projects will benefit from a unified model
that was constrained by data from multiple tasks. The shared model and model-fitting tools will allow easy
comparison of results across Projects, and cross-Project insights to emerge. By implementing uniform statistical
best practices for data analyses, this Core’s work will also promote the rigor and reproducibility of all the
Projects."
10862344,"CORE D – Neuroimaging Core
Functional MRI (fMRI) and advanced multivariate analysis techniques are essential methods for achieving the
aims of this Conte Center proposal. The overarching aim of Core D (Neuroimaging Core) is to support,
optimize and harmonize neuroimaging data collection across the Princeton and Rutgers neuroimaging sites
in order to maximize data quality and to assist with the implementation of advanced imaging analyses to
facilitate hypothesis testing for Projects 1-3. Each of these projects employ fMRI data collection in conjunction
with computational modelling of behavioral tasks (supported by Core C) to determine the neural substrates of
latent cause inference and their relation to key features of mental health.
The Core's specific aims are as follows: Aim 1) Optimize and harmonize MRI sequences and data acquisition
across sites, including optimization of multiband multiecho sequences to improve data quality in key brain
regions involved in latent cause inference that normally suffer from signal dropout; Aim 2) Implement
optimized data preprocessing pipelines with an emphasis on using reproducible, standardized methods;
Aim 3) Implement advanced data analysis methods to meet the aims of Projects 1-3, including multivariate
predictive modeling, representational similarity analyses, advanced functional connectivity analyses, and real-
time fMRI analysis for neurofeedback; Aim 4) Provide education to Center members regarding MRI
methodologies including advanced analytic techniques; and Aim 5) Share neuroimaging data and processing
pipelines in keeping with the Center's open science objectives.
Core D will utilize the state-of-the-art research dedicated neuroimaging facilities housed in the Princeton
University Scully Center for the Neuroscience of Mind and Behavior and in the Rutgers University Center for
Advanced Human Brain Imaging Research (CAHBIR). Harmonization across the two sites will be aided by the
use of the same scanners (3T Siemens Prisma scanners) and the already existing sharing of quality control and
technical expertise across the two neuroimaging facilities. Analysis and educational aims are facilitated by the
expertise of the Core Leads, who have led development of pipelines for individualized functional connectivity
analysis and software packages such as the BrainIAK toolkit that provides the basis for multivoxel pattern
analysis and representational similarity analyses that will be used in Projects 1-3. Existing data management
and high-performance computing infrastructure across the two sites provide the basis for archiving and
analysis of the Center's data. In coordination with Core A, a strong framework for communication with Project
and Core Leads will ensure that the scanning and analytic needs of Center Projects are met in order to fulfill
the goals of the Center."
10855521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic musculoskeletal conditions and their primary source of pain, movement-evoked pain (MEP), causes
significant pain interference, long-term mobility impairment, healthcare costs, and psychosocial inequalities for
individuals, families, communities, and society-at-large. MEP affects more Black/African Americans (B/AAs) and
is perceived as more severe. Compounded by race, age, and more disadvantageous social determinants of
health (SDoH), this unequal burden of pain becomes even greater in health disparity populations, such as older
B/AAs. Many B/AA older adults hesitate to use opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs long-term and
rely on non-pharmacological pain self-management (SM) strategies. Current chronic musculoskeletal pain
(CMP) SM interventions do not measure MEP as a primary endpoint nor address faith/spirituality, Black culture,
and underlying potentially modifiable SDoH (e.g., health literacy, financial hardship), and therefore only offer
small or no benefit over control groups. We propose to enhance older B/AAs’ capacity to manage MEP by
investigating the effects of a socioculturally congruent pain SM intervention (Pain Relief for musculOskeletal
conditions and Arthritis using Culturally-Tailored InterVentions for Black Elders [PROACTIVE]). This prototype
intervention will provide culturally congruent pain SM education with a SM resource toolkit, active prayer, and
financial counseling to explain participants’ healthcare benefits for pain care. This intervention moves beyond
basic cultural tailoring and targets multiple areas for behavior change that are of importance to older B/AAs. We
have assembled a demographically diverse, interdisciplinary, and clinically experienced team to lead this study.
We will enroll 120 B/AAs (50 years and older) with CMP into a parallel group, single-blind, randomized controlled
trial to test whether PROACTIVE decreases MEP in the immediate post-intervention period (n= 60) (Aim 1) and
over time (Sub-Aim 1a) compared to a usual care control group (n= 60). To determine efficacy, we will use state-
of-the-art and real-time technologies to measure primary outcome as well as pain interference, pain coping, and
physical function (secondary outcomes) (Sub-Aim 1b). The PROACTIVE group will work with a faith-community
nurse and financial counselor over four weeks to enhance knowledge of CMP SM, utilization of active prayer
and faith, and financial literacy of health insurance benefits and resources available to cover treatments for pain.
Each weekly session will last up to 2 hours and will be followed by six days of ecological momentary assessments
of pain and SM outcomes and ecological momentary interventions guiding participants through weekly SM
practice skills. A fourth booster session will reinforce content and training and help sustain SM. Also, we will
examine the differential effects of PROACTIVE on MEP according to demographic (sex as a biological variable,
gender, age), psychosocial, and SDoH factors (Aim 2). The proposed intervention is expected to produce
meaningful reductions in MEP in B/AA older adults experiencing disabling chronic musculoskeletal conditions.
Ideally, this study will identify precision behavior targets and responders to inform intervention refinement."
10831438,"Core C SUMMARY
The Cell and Gene Vector Core (Core C) will provide an essential centralized support service to the
investigators on the grant by constructing, propagating and large-scale production of adenoviral, lentiviral and
adeno-associated viral (AAV) stocks, which all Projects will need. Utilizing the vast experience and expertise of
the Core Director's, and in-house established protocols for the viral vector productions, the Core will provide a
consistent and reproducible service in support of the projects. This Core will also house expertise for cultured
myocytes for in vitro mechanistic work including weekly neonatal rat ventricular myocyte preparations and
isolation of adult murine cardiomyocytes when needed. An additional benefit of the Core is that it provides a
resource for teaching others tissue culture and viral production techniques. These essential centralized support
services, used by all Projects, will eliminate variability in virus and myocyte preparations and will be pivotal in
identifying novel signaling pathways, intra-organ communication pathways and sex-dependent mechanisms that
contribute to heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome after cardiac injury and identify potential intersecting
mechanisms to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for repair."
10853440,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTACT
This proposal seeks funds to purchase a Thermo Scientific Vanquish Neo UHPLC for upfront peptide
separation prior to mass spectrometric analysis for The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical
Innovation & Technology in Jupiter, Fl. The system will be placed in the Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics
Core and coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. The instrument will serve two primary
purposes: 1) replacement of the old EASY-nLC 1000 HPLC from Thermo Scientific which will no longer be
serviceable past February 2024 (product line is being retired end of 2023), and 2) sustain bottom-up
proteomics services and experimentation for over 30 investigators of the institute and neighboring and national
institutions, annually.
Four major users from The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology, the
University of Miami, and Seattle Children's Research Institute, with 17 active NIH-funded grants, have been
identified with current and future research projects, which ensures immediate and long-term continued use of
this instrument. There are also 7 additional minor users. The group of major users will utilize the instrument for
peptide separations in front of Orbitrap-based mass spectrometry bottom-up proteomic analyses. The specific
research projects of the major users that will require bottom-up proteomics vary but will globally address
problems related to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, drug abuse, and HIV infection and
treatment.
The Vanquish Neo UHPLC is a new liquid chromatography system by Thermo Scientific that provides all-in-
one nano-, capillary- and micro-flows compatible with high sensitivity LC-MS workflows, reproducible peptide
separations, and ease of use. It is also importantly serviceable as a bundled system with the Orbitrap Fusion
Tribrid mass spectrometer which is also manufactured by Thermo Scientific. As such it is well suited to sustain
current Orbitrap-based bottom up services (qualitative and quantitative proteome investigations). The Vanquish
Neo UHPLC instrument will be housed in the Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Core facility, a central mass
spectrometry shared resource at The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute in Jupiter, FL (formerly Scripps
Research FL/The Scripps Research Institute). The Core is administered by the Institution, within a well-
structured Core framework of 11 other Facilities, and includes Oversight and Advisory committees. There is
very strong financial support from the local Institution and the University of Florida to ensure long-term
utilization of the instrument. This includes financial support for service agreements for the next 5 years and
salary support of a full-time Ph.D. mass spectrometrist to operate the instrument (Scientific Core Director) and
a Research Assistant II staff scientist.
The long-term impact to The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology
and regional institutions will be the addition of a new HPLC that will sustain LC-MS resources for the scientific
and medical research community, and the next generation of scientists."

This proposal would obtain funds for the purchase of a FUJIFILM VisualSonics Vevo F2 small animal ultrasound
imaging system for installation in the TI2EHM core at Tulane University. Tulane lacks a core small animal
ultrasound imaging system, despite being a highly research active institution with over $114mil in NIH funding
awarded in FY22. Currently, the assembled Major Users of this proposal, conducting NIH-supported research,
are utilizing outdated small animal imaging systems within their individual laboratories or those of collaborators
(the Vevo 2100, 1100, and 770). Each system is over 10 years old and service is no longer supported by Visual
Sonics for the 1100 or 770; service for the 2100 expires December 2023. On the Vevo F2, the imaging probes
have been redesigned to be smaller and more ergonomic in comparison to all prior models of the Vevo. The
transducers now spatially compound the data — electronically steering beam to acquire scans of the imaged
object from multiple angles — to reduce image speckle and artifacts. Additionally, all three existing systems have
aging computer operating systems which are increasing unstable. The superior image acquisition and
processing, fast frame rate, high speed data transfer capabilities, and open architecture of the Vevo F2 small
animal ultrasound system will enable new research outcomes for researchers in the Tulane University
community, as detailed in this plan."
10846690,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is a 520-dalton prosthetic group that is required for animal life. Moco was present
in the last universal common ancestor and its synthesis persists in all domains of life. Loss-of-function mutations
in the genes encoding Moco-biosynthetic enzymes cause human Moco deficiency, a rare and lethal inborn error
of metabolism. In animals, Moco supports the activity of 4 enzymes including sulfite oxidase and xanthine
dehydrogenase. These enzymes catalyze critical steps in the metabolism of sulfur amino acids and purines
respectively, essential pathways that cause disease when perturbed. Thus, understanding Moco biology and the
far-reaching metabolic consequences of Moco deficiency is an important goal of human health. The long-term
goal of my research is to i) discover new mechanisms employed by animals to maintain Moco homeostasis and
ii) identify and characterize genetic pathways that regulate Moco-mediated metabolism. We employ an
interdisciplinary approach using unbiased genetic strategies in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans in
combination with functional genomics, biochemistry, and cellular biology to explore previously intractable areas
of Moco biology. This proposal builds on our recent discovery that dietary Moco is bioavailable to C. elegans.
Our work reveals a previously unimagined pathway for Moco transport in an animal. The first goal of the current
proposal is to define the network of proteins necessary for the stable uptake and distribution of Moco in C.
elegans. The second goal of this proposal is to identify regulatory pathways that control sulfur amino acid and
purine metabolism; essential metabolic pathways governed by Moco-requiring enzymes. The proposed research
program will define fundamental pathways that govern Moco biology and may suggest new therapeutic strategies
to treat rare and common diseases where Moco and Moco-mediated metabolism are disturbed."
10846654,"ABSTRACT- Aortic aneurysm (AA) is characterized by localized abnormal dilatation or bulging of aorta due to
weakened vessel wall. AA occurs in different sections of aorta, such as thoracic AA (TAA) and abdominal AA
(AAA). The rupture of aneurysm has high mortality and requires immediate surgical repair. Aortic smooth muscle
cells (SMCs), by regulating aortic contractility and elasticity, are critical for reducing aortic wall stress in response
to the pulsatile high-pressure blood flow from the heart. SMC loss and dysfunction can cause medial
degeneration and contribute to AA development. cAMP and cGMP, are important regulators of SMC contractile
function and vessel wall structural integrity. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), by catalyzing cAMP
and/or cGMP degradation, play crucial roles in specific modulation of cyclic nucleotide signaling and have been
proved to be promising drug targets in highly specific pharmacological interventions. Recently, a few sporadic
lines of clinical and experimental evidence have suggested that stimulating cAMP and cGMP signaling may have
different, even opposite, effects on AA and/or dissection. In this application, we will focus on two PDE1 family
isozymes and AAA. Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that among three PDE1 members (1A,
1B, and 1C), PDE1A and 1C are two major PDE1 isozymes expressed in contractile and/or synthetic SMCs.
PDE1A and 1C primarily hydrolyze cGMP and cAMP, respectively, in SMCs. We recently found that in the human
and mouse aortic tissues, PDE1C is highly induced in synthetic SMC-like cells of AAA compared to normal
controls. PDE1A is expressed in SMCs of both normal and AAA tissues. Interestingly, targeting PDE1A and 1C
likely have opposing effects in AAA: PDE1A deficiency aggravates while PDE1C deficiency attenuates
experimental AAA in mice. PDE1A regulates the contractility of contractile SMCs, and is important for synthetic
SMC survival. However, PDE1C induction promotes SMC phenotype switching, senescence, and death.
Interestingly, the protective effects from PDE1C inhibition overcome the detrimental effects from PDE1A
inhibition in SMCs. These mechanistic differences may be responsible for their functional differences in AAA.
Thus, we hypothesize that chronic PDE1C inactivation suppresses SMC phenotype switching, senescence,
death, and ECM degeneration (e.g. MMPs), thus attenuating experimentally induced mouse AAA. In contrast,
chronic PDE1A inactivation causes SMC contractile dysfunction and increases aortic wall stress, as well as
promotes synthetic SMC death and ECM degeneration, thus exacerbating experimentally induced AAA.
Inhibiting PDE1A/1C together produces a protective effect against AAA because the effect of PDE1C inhibition
overrides the effect of PDE1A inhibition. We will study the regulation, function and mechanism of PDE1A or 1C
in AAA and evaluate the pharmacological effects by targeting PDE1 in AAA. The translational significance of this
study is highlighted by the fact that PDE1 pan inhibitors have been proposed for clinical trials to treat various
diseases, suggesting an urgent need to investigate the potential outcomes of targeting PDE1 isozymes in AA."

 The formation of biomolecular condensates through phase separation is emerging as an
important mechanism for cellular organization and function. The frequent observation of these
condensates at sites of DNA damage, during stress response, and as a precursor to
pathological aggregates in vivo has generated significant interest in their potential roles in
cellular function. However, the relationship between protein sequence and formation,
microstructural organization, and dynamics of biomolecular condensates is only beginning to be
probed. Our belief is that a synergistic combination of computer modeling integrated with
experimental techniques such as NMR, microscopy, and microrheology, to name a few, can
provide the best path toward uncovering the underlying relationship between amino acid
sequence and phase separation. Our strategy to elucidate the molecular origins of phase
separation in biology involves utilizing innovative models and methods developed by us in close
collaboration with leading experimentalists to reconstitute biologically relevant phase separation
systems in silico, thereby translating our extensive knowledge of the molecular determinants of
phase separation of proteins, to biologically relevant processes. Our proposed future work aims
to develop and utilize multiscale computational methods from the atomic to the mesoscale level
to build a molecular mechanistic framework for the predictive modeling of phase separation in
essential biological processes. Our efforts will focus on two biological problems of significant
interest. The first part of the project will focus on the phase separation of RNA binding proteins
and their role in DNA damage repair and transcriptional condensates formed by fusion
oncoproteins. The second part of the project will aim to provide a detailed molecular picture of
phase separated protein assemblies in chromatin organization as it pertains to the co-phase
separation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family with other chromatin-associated proteins
and satellite RNA in constitutive heterochromatin formation, HP1 proteins in gene expression
and cancer drug resistance, and the role of phase separation of polyhomeotic protein (PhP) in
chromatin regulation. These approaches will generate detailed molecular-level information on
the assembly of many components into heterochromatin assemblies and provide the
background knowledge needed to better understand its regulation and disease relevance."
10842110,"Project summary/Abstract
My research program investigates cellular architecture as a key factor in signal transduction. A
long-held tenet of molecular pharmacology is that receptors at the cell surface are the sole site of
action of external, plasma membrane impermeable ligands such as peptide/protein-derived
hormones and biogenic amines. Therefore, understanding of the immediate consequences of
signaling has largely been confined to events that happen proximal to the plasma membrane.
The work from my lab suggests that these are narrow views of how signaling receptors function.
By developing novel tools to visualize signaling in intact cells and focusing on a class of G protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs), we have shown that 1) receptor activation and subsequent G protein-
mediated signaling occurs not only at the plasma membrane but also at previously unappreciated
subcellular compartments such as the endosomes and the Golgi membranes, 2) signaling from
these internal compartments constitutes a critical aspect of cellular responses to external cues,
3) transport mechanisms allow membrane impermeable ligands to access compartments within
the cell, 4) efficacies of certain clinically used drugs may be driven from their serendipitous
capacity to cross the plasma membrane and act on internal receptor pools, and that 5) receptor
activation at each subcellular membrane compartment recruits a unique set of effectors/proteins
via distinct lipid environment at each location. Subcellular, compartmentalized signaling by
GPCRs is a new and largely unappreciated facet of cellular signaling with major implications for
physiology and pathophysiology. My goal is to investigate spatially distinct subcellular
compartments as signaling hubs. We will decipher the factors that initiate signaling at each
signaling hub and determine how each compartment achieves specialized molecular and cellular
outcomes, and how this knowledge can provide a framework for developing therapeutics that
selectively act on compartment specific aspects of signaling."

Repeated or prolonged injury to the pancreas leads to loss of normal exocrine and endocrine tissue and
pancreatic fibrosis. Fibrosis of the pancreas which can lead to stricturing of the common bile and pancreatic
ducts with resultant duct obstruction. Importantly, pancreatic duct obstruction may contribute to the
development of chronic pancreatitis even in the absence of other pancreatic injury. For example, increased
pancreatic duct pressure itself can cause chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic fibrosis. Therefore, it appears
that the pancreas can sense pressure and pressure causes pancreatic injury.
Pancreatic fibrosis results from the deposition of extracellular matrix by activated pancreatic stellate cells
(PSCs). Under normal conditions PSCs reside in the pancreas in a quiescent state but are converted to an
active state when the pancreas is injured. Activated PSCs secrete collagen and other proteins to cause
fibrosis. The observation that pancreatic duct obstruction and pressure, itself, can induce pancreatic fibrosis
even in the absence of inflammation, led us to ask if PSCs can sense pressure? And if so, how?
The recent discovery that pressure sensitivity could be conveyed through cell surface, mechanically-activated
ion channels led us to examine these proteins in the pancreas. We recently discovered that the mechanically-
activated ion channel Piezo1 is highly expressed in PSCs. Our preliminary data indicate that pressure
sensitivity in the pancreas is conveyed by Piezo1 and that Piezo1 activation may be linked to PSC activation.
Therefore, we hypothesize that pressure within the pancreas causes pancreatic fibrosis by stimulating
Piezo1 in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). In the current proposal, we will determine if this pathway is the
mechanism linking pancreatic duct obstruction with pancreatic fibrosis. We believe these studies will identify a
novel mechanism for the development of pancreatic fibrosis. Moreover, we will determine if blocking
mechanically activated ion channels and their signaling pathways protect against pancreatic fibrosis. Overall,
this project will yield novel insights into the initiation of pancreatic fibrosis and could unveil a novel target for
preventing its complications."
10843774,"TITLE: Antigenic determinants of asthma-associated allergens for design of immunotherapy
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
House dust mite allergy is an important health problem worldwide, affecting up to 85% of asthmatic children,
and a risk factor for emergency room admission with asthma. Group 1 and 2 mite allergens account for more
than 50% of total house dust mite specific IgE reactivity in mite allergic patients. Recently, Der p 23 has also
been identified as a major mite allergen, but its contribution to the total house dust mite specific IgE is small.
Group 1 allergens are cysteine proteases that contribute to lung inflammation in asthma, whereas group 2
allergens are lipopolysaccharide binding proteins. Der p 2 has been reported to mimic a human structural-
homolog that activates the innate immune system through toll like receptors. Despite these important molecular
differences between proteolytic group 1 and non-proteolytic group 2, a high IgE prevalence of 83% to allergens
from both groups has been observed in mite allergic patients in the U.S. However, the IgE repertoire and
antigenic determinants associated with these two major allergens are not known. The main goal of this
project is to investigate the antigenic structure of both groups of mite allergens for the design of
immunotherapy. Allergen-specific IgE monoclonal antibodies (mAb) will be produced for the first time with the
correct pairing of the heavy and light chains as they occur in vivo, using hybridomas obtained from the fusion of
B cells from allergic donors with a myeloma partner that confers immortality. Allergens will be co-crystallized
with recombinant IgE antibody constructs. The key amino acids involved in IgE antibody binding will be
identified and modified. The specific aims are: 1) Isolation of IgE mAb specific for asthma-associated allergens
by hybridoma technology; 2) mapping of antigenic determinants on groups 1 and 2 dust mite allergens by X-ray
crystallography and analysis of IgE antibody binding epitopes; and 3) site-directed mutagenesis of IgE antibody
epitopes for expression of hypoallergenic mutants with T cell reactivity as candidates for immunotherapy. An
analysis of the association between mite allergen-specific IgE antibodies from the human repertoire and the
epitopes recognized by these IgE antibodies will be performed with the information obtained in the first two
aims. Aim #2 will generate experimental data sets of three-dimensional structures of B-cell epitopes, which are
currently missing in databases used for developing tools for B cell epitope prediction. Most importantly, this
project will define IgE antibody responses to mite allergens and will provide the structural basis for rational
design of hypoallergens. In Aim #3, IgE antibody binding to the epitope mutants will be analyzed by
immunoassays and cell mediator release assays, and T cell reactivity will be evaluated. Mutants will be
compared and hypoallergenic forms will be selected for the design of vaccines for immunotherapy of mite
allergy."

The mitochondrial protein Prohibitin (PHB) is essential for life. Its importance to cellular activities
is attested by the fact that deletion of PHB is embryonic lethal in mice and that to date no
mutation has been found in the coding region of PHB in any neurological disease conditions,
indicating that PHB integrity is essential and that somatic mutation is detrimental. Our recent
work has demonstrated that PHB has remarkable neuroprotective potential against ischemic
brain injury with an underlying mitochondrial associated mechanism. Its expression is critical for
mitochondrial function in stress situations. However, how this important protein that are stable at
both mRNA and protein levels, is functionally regulated in neuroprotection, as well as how it is
dysregulated in other neurological conditions, remain surprisingly unknown. In exploring the
mechanisms of PHB regulation, we discovered that nitric oxide (NO) is required for PHB
expression mediated neuroprotection. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between NO
and PHB and found that NO modifies PHB post-translationally, through protein s-nitrosylation, a
novel regulatory mechanism similar to protein phosphorylation. In this application, we propose
to study the effects of PHB S-nitrosylation and the mechanisms underlying functional regulation
of PHB by NO. Our central hypothesis is that nitrosylation is critical for PHB’s
neuroprotective function and, consequently, disturbances of PHB nitrosylation are
detrimental and contribute to pathology. We will use a novel mutant knock-in mouse, in
which the sole cysteine residue of PHB protein is mutated so that PHB cannot be nitrosylated,
to analyze the mechanisms of NO regulation and the effects of loss of PHB nitrosylation on PHB
function, in the settings of brain ischemic injury in association with mitochondria structural
alterations. Three specific aims will systematically test the hypothesis. The results of the
proposed studies will reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of PHB which we
believe is crucial to facilitate the design of potential therapies that could ultimately benefit
patients at risk of stroke and other neurological diseases."

guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to
improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to
wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells
at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image
interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap
between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will
likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS.
Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and
quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay
recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse
sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins.
Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final
resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large
tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to
facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic
patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index
(Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection
margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that
it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results
will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes
for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life."
10843874,"Project Summary
 The irradiation at ultra-high dose rates, namely FLASH-RT, can substantially reduce normal-tissue toxicities
while maintaining tumor response (so-called the FLASH effect), compared with the irradiation at conventional
dose rates (CONV-RT). Although many preclinical and some clinical studies demonstrated the potential benefit
of FLASH-RT, the effectiveness of FLASH-RT for general cancer patients is to be further validated through
clinical trials.
 By far the only commercially available system that can deliver ultra-high dose rates needed for general-
purpose clinical FLASH-RT is the proton modality, such as our IBA system. However, the state-of-the-art
treatment planning method, i.e., intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), only optimizes the dose and does
not directly optimize the dose rate or the FLASH effect. A missing prerequisite for proton FLASH-RT clinical
trials is a compatible treatment planning method with FLASH optimization capability.
 The key innovation and enabling technology in this project for clinical FLASH-RT is the first-of-its-kind
FLASH optimization engine via SDDRO, which was recently recognized by PTCOG 59 as the Michael Goitein
Best Abstract Award in Physics for its innovation and impact for FLASH-RT (Gao et al 2021). To the best of our
knowledge, SDDRO is the only method that can optimize the FLASH dose rate as well as the dose. Our
preliminary work (Gao et al 2020) for lung patients has demonstrated that, compared with IMPT, SDDRO
substantially improved the FLASH-dose-rate coverage (in order to have the FLASH effect for reducing normal-
tissue toxicities) while preserving the dose coverage, e.g., increasing of the target-surrounding volume
receiving ≥40Gy/s from ~40% to at least 98%, and the lung volume receiving ≥40Gy/s from ~30% to ~80%,
which occurred at high-dose and high-uncertainty locations with high-risk radiation-induced toxicities. Such
improved FLASH coverage is especially critical for reducing normal tissue toxicities given the hypofractionation
nature of FLASH-RT.
 Given our innovative SDDRO, IBA proton machine with ultra-high-dose-rate capability, academic-industrial
partnership with IBA, FLASH radiobiology and dosimetry expertise, we are uniquely positioned to develop
novel SDDRO methods with FLASH optimization capability that is currently unavailable and urgently needed
for clinical FLASH-RT, including (1) general SDDRO methods with realistic FLASH models, machine
characteristics, and delivery mechanisms (transmission beams, conformal energy filters, or joint); (2)
translation of SDDRO methods into our IBA system, with end-to-end validation and verified FLASH dosimetry.
 The completion of this project will render novel SDDRO methods with FLASH optimization capability that is
currently unavailable and urgently needed for clinical FLASH-RT, and set the stage for FLASH animal studies
and clinical trials."
10842147,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The high stability of local structure for RNA and DNA has profound and widespread impacts on life. The
simplicity of base pairing provides a powerful strategy for enzymes and machines to recognize specific
sequences, and structured RNAs use the high stability to fold incrementally. However, the ease and stability
of base pairing also increases the odds and the consequences of misfolding, requiring RNA chaperones.
More broadly, essentially all cellular processes that require structural rearrangements of RNA or DNA also
require proteins to accelerate these rearrangements. This framework provides the broad theme of our
research. Over the next several years, our focuses will be in three main areas.
(1) Specificity of CRISPR-Cas enzymes. The overarching goal is to understand the molecular origins,
strategies, and limits of specificity of these enzymes for their target sequences. We will explore the hypothesis
that the affinity of the enzymes for their DNA or RNA targets is decreased by mismatches between the guide
RNA and the target strand by an amount that can be understood from the intrinsic properties of the R-loop or
RNA helix. With these affinity penalties as a starting point, we will explore the strategies that nature has used
to generate specificity, and we will probe the origins of enhanced specificity in designed enzyme variants.
(2) RNA chaperone activity of DEAD-box RNA helicase proteins. Over the past two decades, we have
delineated how DEAD-box helicases can function as general RNA chaperones, using local RNA unwinding
to promote folding and structural rearrangements of structured RNAs. Our goals for the next few years are to
explore whether a helicase that functions as a general RNA chaperone can be converted to a specific
chaperone by modular replacement of its intrinsically disordered C-tail. Preliminary results indicate that this
substitution produces a functional chimeric protein, enabling the proposed structural and functional studies.
(3) DNA and RNA compaction and folding. We will leverage a disulfide crosslinking approach that we
developed in 2022 to build on our understanding of the electrostatics of nucleic acid helices and to probe RNA
folding. We will extend our observations of trivalent cation-mediated attraction between DNA helices by testing
polyamines and RNA helices, and we will extend the approach by measuring repulsion or attraction between
nucleosomes. We will also adapt the approach to probe sharp bending of RNA junctions.
In each research area, we strive to answer basic research questions that are likely to give important and
generalizable insights. Our work also has implications for understanding and treating diseases, as defects in
these proteins are linked to many diseases including cancer, and CRISPR-Cas enzymes have emerged as
key tools to combat genetic diseases."
10842151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hyperosmotic stress has been linked to several human diseases. Furthermore, drought-linked
hyperosmotic stress is of major concern for threatening human nutrition and health. However, these
osmotic/drought stress sensors and the early osmotic stress signal transduction mechanisms have
remained largely unknown. Hyperosmotic stress triggers rapid intracellular Ca2+ transients in Arabidopsis.
Moreover, we have recently discovered rapidly-activated Raf-kinases that are required for early
hyperosmotic stress signal transduction in Arabidopsis. These early signal transduction mechanisms are
required for resistance mechanisms, including downstream biosynthesis of the stress resistance
hormone abscisic acid. Rapid osmotic stress responses in the highly developed Arabidopsis model
organism provide an ideal system for dissection of a eukaryotic osmotic stress sensing and signal
transduction machinery. The long-term objective of this research program is to achieve a molecular,
cellular, mechanistic and quantitative understanding of osmotic stress sensing and signal transduction in
the genetically tractable Arabidopsis model system.
 We will address the question of the unresolved osmotic stress sensor machinery and signal
transduction cascade, through an innovative screen and new mutants we have isolated that greatly impair
the rapid osmotic stress-induced Ca2+ transients. Moreover, downstream of hyperosmotic stress, we have
recently found osmotic stress-triggered genome-wide chromatin remodeling that correlates with osmotic
stress-induced transcriptome responses. The question of how osmotic stress signal transduction links to
and mediates osmotic stress-induced genome reprogramming will be pursued. Furthermore, the question
whether osmotic stress-induced chromatin remodeling primes the genome for future stress resistance
will be investigated and underlying mechanisms will be determined. Another question of particular interest
is how guard cells rapidly close stomata in response to low humidity (high vapor pressure difference),
thereby reducing water loss. This elusive cellular low-humidity sensing and signal transduction pathway
has been hypothesized to be related to osmotic stress sensing and signaling. We have recently
discovered Raf-kinases, overlapping with the above-mentioned hyperosmotic stress-activated Raf-
kinases, and a transmembrane receptor like pseudo kinase that are required for the rapid low humidity
response in guard cells, providing a foothold for dissecting the underlying molecular and cellular signal
transduction pathway. My laboratory applies diverse cellular signaling, genetic, genomic, biophysical and
time-resolved imaging approaches to address fundamental questions in stress sensing and signaling.
Results from this research will illuminate the elusive osmotic/drought and humidity sensing and signaling
mechanisms and could lead to future strategies for improving food security for human health and nutrition."

Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) affects as many as 4 in 10 children, mostly adolescents, and accounts for
the majority of new referrals to pediatric rheumatology. Long-term physical and psychosocial outcomes for
adolescents with CMP are poor with increased healthcare utilization and psychological co-morbidities.
Additionally, current treatment regimens for CMP have limited accessibility. Resilience is a dynamic process of
positive adaptation or development in the context of significant adversity, such as living with excessive chronic
pain. Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) is a successful resilience-training intervention for
adolescents and young adults with serious illness. Preliminary data for this proposal demonstrate a moderate
correlation between self-perceived resilience and symptom severity among adolescents as well as high feasibility
and acceptability of PRISM delivery among youth with CMP. Qualitative feedback was universally positive with
the consistent recommendation to add a patient group session to the intervention. With an added patient group
session to the intervention, we now aim to ascertain the impact of the adapted intervention (Promoting Resilience
in Stress Management (PRISM) for adolescent Chronic musculoskeletal pain [PRISM-C]) on pain-related clinical
outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. The overall objectives of the proposed project are to (1) determine
the efficacy of PRISM-C in a population of youth with CMP, (2) explore moderators of the intervention to identify
youth most likely to benefit from resilience coaching, and (3) assess implementation outcomes and identify
barriers and facilitators to engagement in PRISM-C. Findings from this work will further our understanding of
psychosocial factors important in adolescent CMP in order to reduce disease burden and improve long-term
outcomes. Study results will serve as preliminary data for an R01 application to perform a multicenter randomized
controlled trial of PRISM-C for adolescents with CMP. The proposed Career Development Award addresses how
to improve access to and efficacy of interdisciplinary treatments for CMP. The exceptional resources and
institutional support at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, outstanding
multidisciplinary mentorship team, and proposed career development activities will allow the candidate to
achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized pediatric
rheumatologist with expertise in pediatric chronic pain, resilience, and behavioral health interventions with the
goal of improving the long-term physical and psychosocial outcomes for adolescents with CMP."

10843796,"Addictions are heritable, polygenic and multifactorial disorders that pose substantial burden to persons and
communities. A biomedical approach to substance use and addictions, encompassing genetics, neuroscience,
neuroimaging, pharmacology, statistics, biology, informatics and psychiatry/psychology, along with access to
multi-modal data, provides a strong foundation upon which translational studies aimed at understanding the
neurobiological underpinnings of drug use and misuse are built. This competing continuation requests another
5 years (years 31-35) of support for 6 postdoctoral training slots that will provide research training and career
development to 3 MDs and 3 PhDs pursuing postdoctoral research with 27 preceptors across 7 departments
(Psychiatry, Anesthesiology, Genetics, Neuroscience, Neurology, Psychological & Brain Sciences, Biomedical
Engineering). The fellowship will typically encompass a 3-year period for MDs, and a 2-3 year period for PhDs,
depending on the scope of the project. Co-led by Drs. Agrawal and Moron-Concepcion (with complementary
expertise in human and animal neurobiology of addictions), the Biomedical Research Training in Drug Abuse
(BRTD) is the only T32 which offers biomedical addictions training, with an emphasis on neurobiology, at
Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), which is home to 20 additional postdoctoral institutional training
grants. BRTD has a long history of recruiting highly qualified trainees (1-2 first-authored publications at entry)
and securing their continued academic success. Prior trainees are now tenured faculty members at WUSTL
and elsewhere, science officers for pharmaceutical or biomedical entrepreneurial companies, and are
themselves mentoring the next cohort of scientists. The 27 preceptors are NIH-funded investigators with a
history of mentorship in addiction-related biomedical research. The trainees devote 70% of their effort towards
mentored research. The remaining effort is devoted to didactics (coursework, workshops and seminars) that
advance the trainees' breadth of knowledge and provide new skills (e.g., programming, bioinformatics, data
mining) that keep apace of accelerating big data and computational approaches. In addition, trainees
undertake career development activities in science communication, NIH PI-ship and diversity in neuroscience,
as well as required instruction in Responsible Conduct of Research (including content specific to addiction) and
Reproducibility in Science. Recognizing that trainees may choose different career trajectories, they may also
engage in grant writing and mock NIH review, teaching, public speaking or entrepreneurship training. This
renewal maintains our strong emphasis on neurobiology, while adding in novel scientific components (greater
emphasis on multi-modal research, e.g., genetics and human neuroimaging, neuro-pharmacology and
genetics) as well as a robust career development program that rounds out scientific training. Preceptors with
new expertise (including participation of Biomedical Engineering) and new course offerings in data science add
fresh perspectives to our objective of training highly competitive addiction researchers."
10847771,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: SUMMARY
The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) utilizes the Cancer
Center Support Grant (CCSG) developmental funds to fuel its strategic plans for the advancement of early-
stage investigators, team science, translational and clinical research, and support of strategic faculty
recruitments. During the current project period, a total of $927k of CCSG developmental funds were distributed
for pilot research funding in support of 22 projects. Including the CCSG funds, HCC invested a total of $3.4M in
pilot research funds awarded between 2018-2022, which can be directly linked to the successful award of
$46.3M million in extramural, multi-year grant funding. This is a 13-fold return on investment. In addition,
CCSG developmental funds supported the recruitment of seven new faculty recruits supporting the expansion
of scientific expertise in the Cancer Control (CC), Cancer Biology and Immunology (CBI), and Developmental
Cancer Therapeutics (DCT), Research Programs. Jezabel Rodriguez-Blanco, PhD (DCT), was recruited in
2020 following her postdoctoral studies at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Her interests focus
on diseases that result from minimal misbalances in the brain and identifying therapeutic strategies to correct
them. Michael Marrone, PhD, MPH (CC), joined in 2021 after his postdoctoral fellowship in epidemiology from
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. A translational epidemiologist, his goal is to apply
epidemiologic methods at the intersection of population science and basic science to improve the translation of
cancer biomarkers into population health impact. Thibaut Barnoud, PhD (CBI), was recruited from the Wistar
Institute in 2021. His lab examines the effect of p53 variants on cancer risk and response to therapy and the
role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) on the initiation and progression of cancer. Aguirre de Cubas, PhD (CBI),
was recruited in 2021 from Vanderbilt University Medical Center for his expertise in molecular determinants of
immunogenicity, Kalyani Sonawane, PhD (CC), joined HCC in 2022 from the University of Texas School of
Public Health and brings a wealth of expertise in clinical analytics and decision science. Casey Langdon, PhD
(CBI), was hired in 2022 from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital for his expertise in genomic changes,
such as those observed in rhabdomyosarcoma that mechanistically alter tumor maintenance and identity.
Saverio Gentile, PhD (DCT), was recruited in 2022 from the University of Illinois, Chicago. His lab focuses on
the role of ion channels in cancer biology. In the next project period, HCC requests $200k per year in
developmental funds. These funds will be utilized to meet the following specific aims: 1) Award pilot research
funding to HCC investigators to promote team science, high-risk/high-reward ideas, and pre-clinical and clinical
concepts; 2) Invest in new faculty start-up packages in support of the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan; and 3)
Support up to 20% effort for two early-stage clinical investigators annually who will be charged with developing
innovative investigator-initiated trials."
10847772,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (SRM): SUMMARY
Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) supported five shared resources (SRs) in the last cycle and now presents six
SRs, with another one under development. Each SR aims to provide cutting-edge basic, translational, and
population sciences technologies. A distinguishing feature of these SRs is that they are led by highly qualified
scientists who ensure that HCC members have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation, technologies, and
expertise providing high-quality, cost-effective, and rapid service to enhance and enhance HCC members'
research. In addition to experimental design consultation, each SR facilitates the analysis of results for all
services in biostatistics, bioinformatics, genomics, lipid metabolomics, imaging, flow cytometry, and histologic
studies. Shared Resource Management (SRM) is led by the Associate Director (AD) of SR, Steven A.
Rosenzweig, PhD (DCT), in collaboration with the AD of Research Administration (Travis Poole, MHA),
providing scientific and administrative oversight to facilities and personnel. The three HCC research programs
are supported by six established and one developing SR (Social Determinants of Health Shared Resource)
responsive to HCC investigator’s scientific needs. The six established SRs include Biorepository and Tissue
Analysis, Biostatistics, Cell and Molecular Imaging, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting, Lipidomics, and the
newly added Translational Science Laboratory. SR leaders and staff are superbly qualified and impart their
enthusiasm and knowledge to all users. In addition to NIH S10 equipment grant applications, additional
institutional funding sources, including semi-annual support from the Provost, have enabled the purchase of
new instrumentation and timely replacement of aging instruments. Additional funds are available through our
successful HCC Equipment and Technology Awards Program designed for SR directors to request
replacement instrumentation and service contracts or through the acquisition of newer, more advanced
equipment. Each respective Internal Advisory Committee annually evaluates the SRs, and recommendations
for SOPs, equipment, and staffing needs are made with input from the External Scientific Advisory Board
(ESAB). New since the last submission, HCC SR is now reviewed annually by the University Cores Committee,
chaired by Rosenzweig. This arrangement harmonizes core management and operations across the
university and ensures that HCC needs are fully addressed. HCC SRs and University Cores were showcased
during the Annual Cores Day program launched in June 2022, featuring oral and poster presentations and
select tours of core facilities. This event was attended by over 120 participants providing evaluations reviewed
by the Cores Committee to prepare for the Cores Day 2023 event. In accordance with the HCC strategic plan,
to power cancer discovery and innovation and train the next generation of investigators, the SRs play an
essential role in moving HCC scientists’ research forward, leading to more high-impact publications, grant
awards, and increased numbers of trainees at all levels since the last submission."
10847773,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION (LPE): SUMMARY
The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) director has integrated external advisory groups and internal committee
structures to create a coordinated and comprehensive planning and evaluation strategy to effect coordination
across MUSC, internally within HCC, with the external engagement of stakeholders across South Carolina
(SC), and with objective external advice from peers at other cancer centers. Chaired by Raymond N. DuBois,
MD, PhD and comprised of the center’s eight associate directors and the oncology service line medical
director, the Executive Council (EC) is the de facto body where decisions are made in the HCC. It provides
scientific oversight and ensures alignment across research efforts, clinical oncology practice, and impact on
clinical research and administration, creating a unified approach to realizing the center’s vision, mission, and
goals. In 2020, with input from its members and advisory entities, the EC redeveloped a five-year strategic plan
to guide the center as we advance. Six priorities emerged: 1) Power cancer discovery & innovation; 2) Deliver
innovative & patient-centered care; 3) Reduce cancer health disparities; 4) Train the next generation; 5)
Develop & maintain a diverse workforce; and 6) Position Hcc for sustained success. The EC meets monthly
with HCC program leaders and shared resource directors who comprise the Research Committee (RC). The
RC oversees and reviews research development within and among the program membership, and devises
approaches to foster transdisciplinary collaborations. Shared resource directors communicate updates to the
committee on usage, new equipment needed, service needs, and member survey results. The External
Scientific Advisory Board, made up of national leaders in oncology research and cancer center leaders, has
had a significant influence on the HCC, including strengthening the role of the Director on the cancer service
line, increased financial support from the state by $10M per year, greater institutional commitment to COE that
tripled the number of staff and funded a new Assistant Director, and alignment of the Scientific Programs. HCC
also benefits from two non-scientific community boards. The Hollings Advocacy Board influences legislative
bodies and the private sector to raise financial support for cancer prevention, care, and research, including the
acquisition of a new mobile health unit to provide education, screening, and vaccinations to citizens residing in
rural SC. The Community Advisory Board (CAB) includes a diverse group of lay community members and
patient advocates representing stakeholders in the state's civic, church, and healthcare areas. The CAB
provides input on the plans and priorities for COE, which ultimately influence the Research Programs, the
clinical trials portfolio, the education and screening intervention programs across the state. Other internal
committees that contribute to planning and evaluation include the Clinical Research Executive Committee and
the Education and Leadership Training Council. Future plans focus on nurturing recently implemented
leadership development activities, generation of our next strategic plan, and expansion of evaluation efforts."
10847774,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM): SUMMARY
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management. The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM)
function is supported through the concerted efforts of the Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Clinical Trials Office
(CTO), the HCC Quality Assurance and Education (QAE) unit, and the HCC Data Safety and Monitoring
Committee (DSMC). The CTO provides centralized research services and oversight for coordinating and
reporting on all oncology-related clinical trials at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Between
2018 and 2022, HCC recruited 8,962 individuals into all clinical research studies (1,080 interventional
treatment, 4,528 interventional non-treatment, and 3,354 non-interventional accruals), and activated 338
studies, of which 85 studies represent institutional or external peer sponsorship.
Part II: Data & Safety Monitoring. HCC’s institutional DSMP was last approved by the NCI in November
2022. The goals of the HCC DSMP are to ensure that Cancer Center research studies are conducted in
compliance with federal and institutional requirements to ensure the safety and welfare of human participants.
The QAE unit provides internal monitoring activities of PRC-approved trials in accordance with a risk-based
monitoring plan, while the DSMC focuses quality assurance and safety monitoring upon MUSC investigator-
initiated interventional trials.
Part III: Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research. Under the ongoing active surveillance leadership
of HCC and guidance from Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), CPDM supports diverse clinical trial
accrual comparable to HCC’s diverse patient catchment area. Twenty-six percent of all trial accruals between
2018 to 2022 represented minority populations (21% Black/African American; 3% Hispanic White; 2% other or
more than one race). South Carolina (SC) Census Data reveals that 51% of the state population is female. SC
state registry data indicate 48% of female cancer cases, while 53% of HCC patients are female. Overall female
trial accrual in CY2022 was 55%. By trial type, females were represented in 35% of treatments, 60% of
interventional non-treatment, and 55% of non-interventional trial accrual.
Part IV: Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan in Clinical Research. HCC accrues patients to
clinical trials across the age continuum. In CY2022, sixty-two new pediatric patients were diagnosed and/or
treated for the first time at MUSC, and a total of 97 pediatric patients were enrolled in clinical trials (23
treatment, 28 interventional non-treatment, and 46 non-interventional. Per SC Census Data, individuals 65
years and older make up 19% of the state population. SC state tumor registry data indicate 55% of cancer
cases are elderly, while HCC’s tumor registry is 59% elderly. In CY2022, 800 elderly patients age 65 and older
were enrolled in clinical trials (145 treatment, 182 interventional non-treatment, 473 non-interventional)."
10847775,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS): SUMMARY
The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees and provides
independent, peer review of the scientific merit, priority, and progress of all prospective, hypothesis-driven,
cancer-related studies involving human subjects conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina
(MUSC). PRMS functions are accomplished by coordinated efforts among twelve HCC Disease Focus Groups
(DFGs) and the HCC Protocol Review Committee (PRC). The objective of the PRMS is to assure rigorous
internal oversight of HCC’s trial portfolio for scientific merit and performance. All trials approved by the PRMS
for merit, whether via full or administrative review, have access to CCSG-supported centralized resources such
as informatics, biostatistics, and clinical protocol and data management. When a new trial opportunity is
presented, HCC implements a rigorous two-stage review. During Stage 1, the DFG members, knowledgeable
in the disease-specific catchment and treatment approaches, critically evaluate the protocol based on scientific
merit, portfolio fit and elimination of competing trials, clinical need, academic value, and operational and
accrual feasibility. The DFG's assessment is captured within a prioritization scoring form, and approved trials
are submitted to the PRC for Stage 2 scientific review. Of the 184 trial opportunities reviewed by the DFGs in
CY2022, 56 (30%) trials were DFG approved and proceeded to PRC; 97 (53%) trials were abandoned due to
DFG or sponsor decision; 31 (17%) trials are currently in consideration pending sponsor documents and DFG
decision. The improvements to enhance DFG engagement and education and strengthen the first stage trial
review process have yielded a much more rigorous scientific review. Because protocols undergo a thorough
first-stage review, the PRC has had to make minimal requests for revisions or contingencies. Of the 205 trials
reviewed by the PRC between CY2020 – CY2022, 29 studies (14%) were contingently approved, and 6
studies (3%) were deferred. Both the DFG and PRC work towards a high-impact clinical trial portfolio that is
congruent to our statewide catchment and appropriately resourced for successful accrual progress and
completion. HCC’s Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) collaboratively enhance these efforts by
providing data and education to faculty and staff about HCC’s patient catchment and consultation with DFG
investigators to support protocol recruitment initiatives and community engagement. The DFGs monitor their
trials for accrual progress and scientific relevance at recurrent DFG meetings, while the PRC monitors a trial’s
progress at three months post-activation and the entire active HCC trial portfolio at standard 6-month intervals.
In CY2022, the PRC conducted 353 study progress reviews, of which 74 (21%) trials were opened less than
six months, 155 (44%) had acceptable progress, 74 (21%) rare trials were approved to continue, and 50 (14%)
were issued a low accrual contingency letter requiring corrective actions and re-review. Nineteen of those 50
low-accruing trials (38%) were closed by the PRC."
10847776,"BIOREPOSITORY & TISSUE ANALYSIS (BTA) SHARED RESOURCE: SUMMARY
The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Biorepository & Tissue Analysis (BTA) Shared Resource (SR) provides
investigators with access to meticulously collected and annotated human specimens as well as advanced
human and animal tissue analyses that require state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise. The shared
resource comprises several integrated services, including a biospecimen and data repository; customized and
readily available tissue microarrays; RNA and DNA extractions; research pathology services, including
histologic analysis of fixed, frozen, and stained tissues; and analysis/interpretation of experimental results.
Three general themes underlie BTA activities that position us to deliver on our three Specific Aims, which offer:
1) tissue and clinical data acquisition; 2) tissue microarrays and analysis, and 3) integrated pathology services.
Since 2013, BTA has collected more than 26,500 cancer-associated biospecimens from patients with solid
tumors and hematological malignancies, all of which are annotated and linked to clinical data. A notable
feature of BTA is its ability to tailor the accrual of specimens to meet the specific needs of HCC members.
Currently, more than 25% of BTA tissue donors are African American patients, who are typically
underrepresented in biorepositories and cancer research. During the current funding period, BTA supported
the research of 41 HCC members, resulting in 64 peer-reviewed publications. BTA has made impactful
contributions to advance cancer research at HCC, including identifying specimens from underserved patients
with Sea Island ancestry and using MALDI imaging to study protein glycosylation patterns in cancer. In addition
to serving a growing group of HCC members, BTA contributes to major national biorepository efforts, including
the NCI-funded Cooperative Human Tissue Network, and the DOD-funded multi-center NCORP Early Onset
Malignancies Initiative (EOMI). BTA has also contributed to the success of the U54 SC CADRE grant and the
construction of a fully functioning biorepository at South Carolina State University (SCSU). Under the
leadership of Steven L. Carroll, MD, PhD (CBI), an expert in the autosomal dominant tumor susceptibility
syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1, BTA has created an ethnically rich and diverse tumor tissue biorepository

key data and insights to support the success of 112 peer-reviewed publications, including work published in
high-impact journals such as Nature Med, JCI, Cell Reports, Cell Mol Immunol, Cancer Res, Cancer Immunol,
and JBC. In summary, FCCS advances, supports, and provides critical, cutting-edge research tools and
methodologies to the HCC community."
10847474,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overarching goal of this K01 application is to examine cerebral mechanisms that underlie psychotic
symptoms (PS) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET), diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI), and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) techniques. I will specifically
address the role of tau pathology and structural and functional network disruptions in the manifestation of PS in
AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem studies have suggested a role of tau pathology in the
manifestation of PS in AD. However, the cerebral mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly
understood. A thorough and comprehensive plan for additional training and related career development
activities is proposed based on: 1) Phenomenology of psychosis in the context of AD from both psychiatric and
cognitive perspectives; 2) Tau neurobiology and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging; 3) Diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI), tractography, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) network
connectivity. These training goals are intended to provide crucial scientific skills needed to test the following
hypotheses: 1) AD patients with PS will show greater tau accumulation in frontal, cingulate, lateral temporal
and parieto-occipital cortices regions compared to AD without PS; 2) AD with PS will show more abnormal
diffusivity, compared to AD without PS, in white matter tracts that connect frontal, cingulate, lateral temporal,
parietal, and occipital lobes, and functional network connectivity abnormalities in cortical circuits involving the
frontal lobe, specifically the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN); in addition, I expect
that tau aggregation in central nodes of the DMN will correlate with delusions, whereas tau aggregation in the
SN will be associated with hallucinations; 3) Tau aggregation will be greater in the central nodes of these
structural and functional networks in AD patients with PS compared to AD patients without PS; and 4) Tau
aggregation in frontal, temporal and posterior cingulate regions, will correlate with social cognition and
executive function impairments in AD patients with PS. I will use a second generation tau radiotracer ([18F]-
PI2620) that has shown excellent imaging properties and high specificity, in combination with a comprehensive
assessment of both psychiatric (delusions and hallucinations) and cognitive (social cognition and executive
function impairment) manifestations of PS. The proposed combination of training and research plans will lay
the ground to launch my independent career to test neurobiological hypotheses regarding behavioral
manifestations of AD from a neuroimaging perspective."
10847475,"Project Summary/Abstract:
This renewal involves integrated and interdependent synthetic, mechanistic, structural, biochemical
mode of action, computer modeling, collaborative and preclinical studies directed at the design,
synthesis, assay and advancement of fundamentally new and unique therapeutic leads and strategies
directed at unsolved global human health problems: the eradication of HIV/AIDS, novel treatments for
Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, and the use of small molecules to enhance antigen density in
antigen-targeted CAR T/NK cell therapies and cancer immunotherapy. HIV is one of the most
catastrophic pandemics to confront mankind. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) addresses the active
virus, allowing one to live with HIV/AIDS, but with cost, compliance, resistance and chronic
chemoexposure challenges. ART is not curative. Reservoir cells incorporating genomically encoded
provirus episodically resupply the active virus. Elimination of these reservoir cells if done with ART is
thus one of the most promising strategies to eradicate HIV/AIDS. Modulation of protein kinase C (PKC)
represents one of the best strategies to activate reservoir cells for subsequent clearance by the immune
system, antibodies or immunotoxins. PKC modulators are also leading candidates for treating
Alzheimer's disease (in current clinical trial), for cancer immunotherapy (clinical trial proposed for 2021),
for multiple sclerosis and for many other unmet therapeutic needs. The lead PKC modulator, bryostatin
1, has been entered into clinical trials for AIDS eradication and Alzheimer's disease and is expected to
be used clinically in a CRADA conducted by NCI scientists to enhance antigen expression in antigen
targeted CAR T cell therapies for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who fail cell therapy
because of low antigen density. Enabled by our scalable (now GMP) synthesis of bryostatin which
represents the sole major supply of clinical grade material and our computational and REDOR solid state
NMR structural studies relevant to bryostatin binding to PKC, plans are presented for the design,
synthesis and evaluation of uniquely accessible “close-in” bryostatin analogs, super simplified analogs
and two new families of clinically relevant PKC modulators, collectively directed at the identification of
more efficacious, better tolerated and more synthetically accessible clinical candidates. New candidates
will be evaluated in a range of “in house” assays and in advanced assays conducted by a network of
collaborators expert in the clinically targeted areas."
10847351,"ABSTRACT
It has become increasingly clear that systemic signals and external stimuli can alter neurodevelopmental
programs, and that early developmental defects become significant contributors to behavioral sequelae
later in life. Despite our current understanding of neurogenesis control, it remains largely unclear what
functions neural circuit activity patterns may exert on NSC proliferation and differentiation during
development. The rodent postnatal lateral ventricular (LV) germinal matrix/neurogenic niche is a
specialized environment housing GFAP+ astrocytes functioning as NSCs, producing mainly GABAergic
interneurons. It is analogous to the postnatal human LV germinal matrix, where robust neurogenesis
persists for up to two years after birth. The postnatal LV niche serves as an excellent model system to
study molecular mechanisms regulating neurogenesis, both in health and in disease states. Postnatal LV
neurogenesis is regulated by NSC-intrinsic mechanisms, interacting with extracellular/niche-driven cues.
It has been generally accepted that these local effects are responsible for sustaining neurogenesis,
though behavioral paradigms and disease states have suggested possibilities for neural circuit-level
modulations. It is currently unclear if activity patterns from groups of neurons, or discrete neural circuits,
can respond to external stimuli and control NSC proliferation in the postnatal brain. We have identified
long-range neuronal projections that can provide excitatory drive to local neurons within the postnatal LV
niche. Our preliminary results have uncovered putative downstream targets of this previously
undescribed neural circuit, the quiescent NSCs, suggesting an exciting connection between external
inputs and NSC activation. We plan to further explore these observations by determining the following: 1)
the cellular identity of the postnatal LV quiescent NSCs; 2) which brain regions can serve as a relay for
external stimuli to induce LV NSC proliferation; and 3) which postnatal radial glial progenitors, and their
activity-dependent maturation process, are responsible for constructing the neural circuits to direct
quiescent NSC activation. Our proposal explores a direct connection between neuronal activity patterns
from discrete circuits and postnatal NSC proliferation. To make this research question tractable, we have
developed new mouse reagents, as well as experimental platforms to measure the interactions between
patterns of neuronal activity and NSC proliferation. We believe findings from these experiments will
significantly advance our understanding of how neural circuit activity controls stem cell proliferation in the
postnatal brain in health and disease."
10847479,"SUMMARY
Aortic homeostasis is essential for vascular health. The vascular endothelium is a vital organ whose health is
essential to normal vascular physiology; when dysregulated, it becomes a critical factor in the pathogenesis
of a variety of vascular diseases. Growing evidence indicates that endothelial cells (ECs) play an
underappreciated role in the development and progression of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD).
Most notably, compromised barrier integrity has been implicated as a precursor to the development of TAA.
Work from our laboratory has led to the appreciation that a member of Cellular Communication Network (CCN)
gene family, CCN3, serves as an important regulator of vascular health. However, the precise physiological
role of CCN3 in vivo as well as the fundamental mechanisms responsible for CCN3’s action remain largely
undefined. Recently, our preliminary studies suggest that CCN3 serves as an endogenous inhibitor of TAAD.
Recently, our preliminary studies suggest that endothelial dysfunction due to CCN3 deficiency predisposes
animals to thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). In a mouse model of Marfan syndrome
(Fbn1mgR/mgR), global deficiency of CCN3 deficiency exacerbates thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) in Marfan
mice characterized by increased aortic root and ascending thoracic aortic dilation, elevated incidence of
vessel dissection, and, as a consequence, enhanced mortality. Similar findings were obtained when
challenging animals with angiotensin II (Ang II). Endothelial restricted knockout mice (EC CCN3-/-)
subjected to Ang II infusion exhibited augmented aortic root and thoracic aortic dilation along with an elevated
severity of aortic wall destruction. Mechanistically, our initial bulk RNAseq studies suggested that loss of
CCN3 perturbs vascular junction and causes aberrant activation of signaling pathways involved in
inflammation. Our subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies further support that key factors secondary to CCN3
deficiency (endothelial barrier disruption, inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS)) cause endothelial
dysfunction and play a pivotal role in TAAD development and progression. These observations provide the
foundation for the central hypotheses of this application: CCN3 serves as a critical physiological regulator for
the maintenance of endothelial function essential for the prevention of TAAD. Studies in this proposal will
rigorously address this hypothesis. The role of endothelial CCN3 in mitigating TAAD will be fully characterized.
Mechanistic basis of how CCN3 deficiency leads to endothelial dysfunction will be investigated. The results
of these studies will elucidate the role of CCN3 in controlling endothelial function and the mechanisms
underlying its ability to promote endothelial barrier integrity and limit inflammation."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the complexity of the aging process and its profound effects across all levels of biological
organization will require a strong, interdisciplinary, and diverse supply of talented scientists. The overall goal of
The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) Research Development Core is to provide support
for career development of junior faculty entering the field of basic aging biology or other investigators who wish
to change career direction towards basic aging research. In 2017, the pilot award format was changed from
providing funds awarded to two investigators per year ($50,000 each) to an innovative in-kind program where
experiments were streamlined for awardees enabling more experiments to be performed for a larger number of
investigators within the same budget. During the current funding period, the JAX NSC Research Development
Core competitively awarded funding and resources to aging projects across biological systems that resulted in
new discoveries, research publications and sources of funding, and helped junior awardees to establish their
own independent careers in aging research. Moving forward, these successes will be expanded by providing
targeted funding to exciting projects proposed by investigators new to aging research, and by offering a variety
of research and intellectual resources to support awardees and other aging investigators in their work. The
outstanding institutional resources available at JAX, a premier institution for mouse genetics and systems biology
research, will be leveraged to sustain and grow this foundation of researchers at JAX and within the aging
community. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Fund projects for new investigators in aging research using a
competitive pilot award program. Promising investigators new to aging research will be funded through a
competitive process so they can generate the data and gain the expertise necessary to support competitive
funding applications and a transition to a career in aging biology. Aim 2. Provide resources to support pilot
awardees and investigators new to aging research. Access to resources (e.g., aging mice, data, tissues,
phenotype platforms, expertise) will be provided to support pilot awardees and other investigators new to aging
research. The aging mouse cohorts and phenotyping technologies supported by the JAX NSC present a valuable
opportunity for investigators to access material and collect data that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive
or difficult to obtain. Aim 3. Provide mentorship and career development opportunities in aging research.
Investigators new to aging research will be provided with mentorship by JAX NSC researchers and collaborators.
They will also be given opportunities for career development in the aging field via support with the grant writing
process, opportunities to participate in aging meetings, and introductions to potential collaborations within the
broader aging community. The impact of the Research Development Core is that the pool of investigators
devoted to the study of the basic biology of aging will be expanded."

the Committee. Each Associate Director is responsible for either the Enrichment Series, Clinical Component,
or Pilot and Feasibility Program. They meet weekly to review the operation of the Center. Six to 8 times a year,
members of the Leadership Committee meet as an Executive Committee, which also includes the Directors
of the Biomedical Cores and two DHC investigators representing the membership at large. The function of the
Executive Committee is to assist the leadership in reviewing Core utilization, provide support with scientific and
overall directions of the DHC, and help with conflicts arising from membership applications. Once a year, or
more often, the Executive Committee meets with the Internal Advisory Board to review strategic needs of the
Center and maintain institutional support to foster digestive disease research. This operational structure has
promoted collaborations among our Research Base of 68 investigators, who have published 630 articles in the
past 4 years and attracted ~$36.5 million in direct funds for digestive disease research. The Enrichment
Program fosters additional scientific development and a successful Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Program
supports the career development of junior investigators. Overseeing the strategic operation of the DHC is an
External Advisory Board (EAB) comprised of four extramural scientific leaders. The EAB evaluates ongoing
research and programmatic directions of the Center, reviews, identifies, and recommends support for the most
meritorious P/F applications, and assesses the effectiveness of the Administrative and Biomedical Cores. The
EAB prepares and submits an annual report to the Chair of Pediatrics and Director Research of the
Research Foundation, who holds the primary reporting authority and oversight of the Center. The
Administrative Core structure and operation have been very effective over the past 14 years of the DHC
existence, have maintained the DHC as a real catalyst of scientific discoveries, have ensured the delivery of
state-of-the-art services that meet the needs of Center investigators, have implemented successful enrichment

10848456,"ANIMAL AND PHENOTYPING CORE
PROJECT SUMMARY
The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) provides diverse animal resources to enhance
research in the genetics of aging. The overall goal of the Animal and Phenotyping Core is to increase the diversity
of mouse resources available for aging research. The JAX NSC remains the preeminent aging research center
for the development and dissemination of aging mouse models and resources. These resources include 32
common inbred strains for which the JAX NSC freely provides comprehensive lifespan and healthspan data via
the interactive Mouse Phenome Database (MPD). In the current funding period, JAX investigators established
models to study the genetics of aging using highly diverse strains, including Collaborative Cross (CC) inbred
strains and Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. In addition to animal resources, a robust phenotyping pipeline ideally
suited for large-scale, non-invasive testing of aging mice was developed. The Animal and Phenotyping Core will
continue to generate valuable, high-demand animals and phenotyping resources for the aging community and
distribute these resources effectively to ensure their widespread use. The Core will also promote the overarching
goals of the NIA Nathan Shock Center Program through extensive interactions with all other JAX NSC cores,
with other NSCs and the NSC Coordinating Center (NSCCC), and with the aging community at large. The
Specific Aims of the Animal and Phenotyping Core are to: Aim 1. Provide unique animal resources to support
aging research. Specifically, in Aim 1A, aging colonies of DO, CC, and C57BL/6J mice will be continuously
maintained “on the shelf” and available for Pilot Awards. In Aim 1B, in conjunction with the Data and Statistical
Core, the lifespan, extensive healthspan phenotyping, and QTL analyses of the dietary intervention study
initiated in the prior funding period will be completed.Aim 2. Enable characterization of animal resources by
providing robust and novel phenotyping assays relevant to human lifespan and healthspan. Affordable,
novel, targeted phenotyping, and tissue and blood samples will be provided to researchers in the aging field to
facilitate a comprehensive characterization of aged mice. Aim 3. Implement a large-scale study on the impact
of genetic diversity on senescence and the effect of senolytics in DO mice and couple phenotypic
responses to the underlying genetics. Senescence and the effect of senolytics have only been studied in
C57BL/6J mice. Male and female DO control mice and mice treated with senolytic ABT263 will be extensively
phenotyped in order to couple senescence and senolytic treatment in various tissues and phenotypic responses
at 24 months of age to the underlying genetics. Aim 4. Coordinate with the Data and Statistical Core to
analyze data and streamline dissemination efforts to the aging community via the JAX NSC website and
the MPD. The Animal and Phenotyping Core will support aging research by continuing to generate and distribute
valuable, high-demand mouse genetic and phenotyping resources for the aging research community."

The overall goal of the Gene Analysis Core of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to provide DHC
investigators with fully integrated services to catalyze research on genetics and genomics using advanced
instrumentation, reliable protocols, and knowledge for experimental planning and execution. The Core pursues
this goal with four complementary aims. In the First Aim “to develop an integrated service structure for studies
on gene sequence and function,” the Core integrates a comprehensive portfolio of services into one
operational unit with a shared leadership of laboratories that provide gene-based assays and expert
bioinformaticians and protein quantification technologies. This structure facilitates consultation and service
requests by DHC investigators, with well-defined processes for service request, monitoring of progress, and
data sharing. In the Second Aim “To generate genomics data using cutting edge assays to assess gene
sequence and function,” the Core makes available to DHC investigators streamlined. In the Third Aim “to
provide bioinformatics consultation and analysis for genetics and genomics studies,” the Core gives members
opportunities for the optimization of experimental design, technology selection, bioinformatics, and functional
annotation of the large datasets produced by the Gene Sequence and Expression Laboratories.
Bioinformaticians use refined workflows and computational approaches to fully integrate data from orthogonal
technologies, develop improved metadata standards for application in digestive disease datasets at multiple
levels of granularity, and provide new solutions for data access and exploration. Bioinformaticians personalize
analytical pipelines to meet the investigators’ needs using powerful computing cluster environment and in a
secured fashion by industry-quality firewall systems. And in the Fourth Aim to “enable the validation of gene
expression at the protein level,” the Core offers investigators the opportunity to validate at the protein level the
expression of gene and gene groups using complementary assays in body fluids, cell surface, and intracellular
environment. The service portfolio managed by the Gene Analysis Core has been highly subscribed by DHC
investigators and has been linked to a high scientific output in peer-reviewed original publications that are
relevant to digestive disease."
10848458,"DATA AND STATISTICAL CORE
PROJECT SUMMARY
Mouse studies sponsored by The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) produce an enormous
amount of data, including phenotypic, genetic, epigenetic, expression profiling and microbiome profiling data.
Our focus on genetic diversity using Collaborative Cross (CC) inbred and Diversity Outbred (DO) mice requires
the analysis of hundreds of mice. With new phenotyping technologies constantly being developed, the scope of
data collection and analysis continues to grow. Thus, a well-functioning and efficient data management and
statistical analysis operation is necessary. The overall goal of the JAX NSC Data and Statistical Core is to provide
support for the management, quality control, analysis, and dissemination of data for JAX NSC projects. The
Specific Aims of the Data and Statistical Core are to: Aim 1. Develop and maintain the data management,
quality control, and analysis infrastructure needed to support JAX NSC projects. We will continue to
develop this system to implement automated data collection and quality control procedures for our growing
portfolio of pilot projects and collaborations. Aim 2. Disseminate JAX NSC data and analytical tools to
provide greater access to these and other data resources related to mouse models in aging research.
This aim will support development of new data types and web-based interactive tools. We will mine public
repositories for aging-related transcriptional profiling data from mouse studies to update and integrate with JAX
NSC data. Aim 3. Provide study design and statistical analysis support for the aging research community.
The Core will engage in collaborative research with members of the aging research community to support the
broader adoption of genetic diversity in aging studies that use mouse models. This outreach activity will be
managed and tracked in parallel with projects in the other JAX NSC Cores but with an emphasis on working with
collaborators who have or who plan to generate their own primary experimental data. The Data and Statistical
Core is significant because it will provide efficient, comprehensive and cutting-edge management, analysis, and
dissemination of data generated from aging mouse studies focused on understanding the genetic factors that
underlie lifespan and healthspan. Improved data management and quality control methods, greater emphasis
on active outreach to promote use of JAX NSC data, and deeper engagement with collaborative projects, will
accelerate the pace of aging research, enhance the impact of the Core on the geroscience research community
and increase the visibility of the JAX NSC data and other resources."

The overall goal of the Integrative Morphology Core of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to provide
DHC investigators with state-of-the-art, high quality, efficient and reliable technology support for morphologic
studies of digestive diseases. The Core pursues this goal with three complementary aims. In the First Aim “to
develop an effective service infrastructure to support morphologic studies,” the Core developed and
implemented an organizational infrastructure and personnel to greatly facilitate the request and execution of
services in a cost-efficient basis, while enhancing interactions between the investigative groups. The Core is
directed by an experienced pathologist with expertise on molecular biology and advanced instrumentation for
high-definition analysis of fixed and living cells and tissues. In the Second Aim “to augment microscopic
analyses of tissue and cellular structure and function,” the Core staffs three laboratories with highly qualified
technicians or directors in three complementary laboratories: 1) Research Pathology Laboratory, focusing on
histochemical, immunostaining, and electron microscopy analysis of cells and tissues; 2) Live Microscopy
Laboratory that specializes in 2-photon-based confocal microscopy of live cells and tissues; and 3) Confocal
Imaging Laboratory, with a superb infrastructure for high-end confocal microscopy. In the Third Aim “to
ensure quality control, cost efficiency, and technology transfer,” the Core implements a quality assurance
program related to reliability of reagents, well-functioning instruments, user safety, proper hands-on-training,
and streamlined process for service requests. The Core has evolved with the acquisition of new
instrumentation, incorporation of artificial intelligence to deconvolute digital information and increase
the resolution of confocal microscopy, and collaboration with the Gene Analysis Core and the Biobank
to perform spatial sequencing. The Core also holds seminars and workshops as part of the Center
enrichment series with the goal to provide DHC investigators with practical reviews and analysis of the latest
technologies and assays, and to empower investigators to take advantage of the resources based on their
scientific needs. This management strategy and commitment to research excellence have resulted in large
utilization of services and have been linked to a high scientific output in peer-reviewed original
publications that are relevant to digestive disease."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Evaluating changes that precede frailty and end of life using histological characterization of age-related lesions
augments molecular, cellular, and physiologic data, and provides an understanding of early-onset mechanisms
that underlie age-related changes that may eventually have clinical relevance. The overall goal of the Image

histopathological analysis and discovery of age-related histological features. Recently, the NIA-funded
Geropathology Research Network (GRN), established to enhance the translational value of geropathology for
preclinical research studies in anti-aging clinical trials,
developed and validated a grading system, designated
the geropathology grading platform (GGP), for quantification and comparison of histological lesion scores in
tissues from aging mice. While implementation of this grading platform by a trained pathologist may be feasible
for experiments with small numbers of animals, an automated approach is necessary for experiments consisting
of large sample numbers. An automated approach that can provide unbiased analysis of large sample numbers
will lead to a more timesaving and cost-effective analysis and generation of more robust data. A quantitative
image analysis pipeline that uses machine learning to accurately identify specific features in scanned slides of
stained kidneys was recently developed. This quantitative tool can be easily adjusted to allow quantification
using the GGP. The Specific Aims of the Image Analysis Core are: Aim 1. Adapt a quantitative pipeline for
the analysis of aged heart, liver, and lung tissues by training and establishing classifiers. Currently,
scanned slides of mouse kidneys are uploaded and processed into a large number of tiles in TIF format, and
then histological features specific for the kidney are identified and automatically fed into ImageJ for quantification.
This pipeline will be adapted for aging research by introducing a training set to identify tissue-specific histological
features and develop filters for scoring the lesions according to the GGP. Aim 2. Validate the quantitative
pipeline using an annotated set of aged mouse tissues from the Geropathology Research Network. Once
pipelines specific for heart, liver, and lung are developed and trained, their accuracy and robustness will be
validated by analyzing a set of annotated slides provided by the GRN. Aim 3. Develop and distribute to the
geroscience community open-source, user-friendly packages for both the quantitative and discovery
pipelines with online training. In addition to providing image analysis as a Core service, the pipelines will be
made available to the geroscience community so that other investigators can do their own analysis and
customize the pipelines for their own research. These quantitative and discovery tools can be trained for use on
any tissue or organ and, once adapted, will be invaluable to the geroscience community. Computer-assisted
geropathology will be a powerful tool to measure study endpoints as well as determining the effects of
intervention in aging studies."
10848310,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the Pluripotent Stem Cell and Organoid Core of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is
to provide DHC investigators with fully integrated services to catalyze research on mechanisms of digestive
diseases via innovative and reliable model systems using native and genome edited stem cells and organoids.
The Core pursues this goal with four complementary aims. In the First Aim “to provide DHC investigators with
human iPSCs and iPSC-derived organoids and training,” the Core makes available to users quality-tested
human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and PSC-derived multilineage cellular organoids of the esophagus, fundic
and antral regions of the stomach, intestine, colon, and liver. The Core also facilitates the production of tissue-
derived enteroids and liver and biliary organoids. These are novel 3D-miniature organs that enable studies
related to physiology and pathobiology relevant to humans. Core leaders and experienced staff hold
technology transfer through formal tiered courses and hands-on training, supervision, and support. In the
Second Aim “to provide next generation organoid technologies for cheaper, scalable, high-quality organoids,”
the Core provides investigators with the opportunity to generate organoids from healthy or diseased subjects
using novel, reliable protocols for more efficient and scalable directed differentiation of human PSCs into
organoids. In the Third Aim “to provide services for CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing of human PSCs,”
the Core evolved in its scope of technology and service to offer DHC Investigators state-of-the-art genome
editing using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Successful projects have used knockin and knockout editing to study
mechanisms of disease. To be able to track and visualize these cells in experimental assays, the Core also
provide reporter-labeled PSC-editing and screening services to establish novel cell lines based on
investigators’ needs. And in the Fourth Aim “to bank and make available quality-controlled iPSC lines and
organoids for digestive research,” the Core banks well phenotyped natural and edited hPSC lines as well as
disease-specific iPSCs to catalyze the translation of basic research findings into novel diagnostic and
therapeutic tools. The service is aligned with high quality metrics and meets regulatory requirements for de-
identification and human subject protection. Collectively, these novel technologies empower DHC investigators
to study mechanisms of disease using multi-cellular experimental systems that have direct “lineage” to normal
and diseased human tissues (including at different stages of maturation). The delivery of services is
streamlined and centralized, and positions investigators to explore new collaborative projects to catalyze
discoveries that will positively impact digestive disease research."
10848312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overall goal of the Clinical Component of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to accelerate the
translation of basic research into clinical studies and trials for pediatric digestive diseases. The Clinical
Component pursues this goal with three complementary aims. In the first Aim “to provide consultation on study
design and biostatistical services for DHC investigators,” the Clinical Component makes available to DHC
investigators a web-based portal for services related to study design, statistical analysis, and result reporting.
This line of services is led by the Director of the Clinical Component and a biostatistician with expertise on
digestive disease studies. Subsidized consultation is also available through the Cincinnati Center for
Translational Science and Training and institutional Data Management and Analysis Center (DMAC), which are
staffed by statisticians and certified data analysts. In the second Aim “to provide data management and
infrastructure for implementation, monitoring, and reporting of patient-based research on digestive diseases,”
the Clinical Component makes available to DHC investigators the infrastructure for comprehensive data
management services via DMAC, REDcap and other large-data platforms. These platforms count on rigorous
security and compliance requirements for clinical and translational research. And in the third Aim “to provide
access to tissues and genomic samples for digestive disease research,” the Clinical Component partners with
the institutional biobank that is designed to facilitate patient-based research in the pediatric population. The
biobank makes it possible for DHC investigators to obtain de-identified stored tissues and relevant disease
information for approved studies. It also facilitates the development of customized biorepositories for
investigator-initiated projects and helps with submission of IRB proposals focused on studies of digestive
diseases. Biostatistical and study design consultations are a key component of the review and ranking of Pilot
and Feasibility projects to ensure that applicants use scientifically rigorous approaches when designing pre-
clinical and clinical studies. In the current funding period, the Clinical Component supported over 30 DHC
Investigators with 12,119 hours of statistical analysis, 10,775 hours of REDCap usage and support, and
access to 1,184 tissues from digestive disease organs. We are well positioned to continue to serve the needs
of DHC Investigators, integrate our services with other DHC Cores, and accelerate the translation of basic
research into clinical studies and trials for pediatric digestive diseases."
10848317,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the Enrichment Program of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to advance digestive
disease research by creating a forum where investigators will present new research findings, learn about new
technologies, and pursue new collaborations. The Director of the Program and DHC leaders pursue this goal
with four complementary aims. In the First Aim “to promote knowledge sharing through a weekly seminar and
workshop series,” the Program sponsors a series of highly interactive seminars and presentations by
investigators from the academic health center and extramural scientists who are leaders in digestive disease
research. These seminars also include technology-centered workshops that are given by Core directors and
staff. Presenters receive timely feedback and suggestions on their experimental approaches and emerging
technologies. Seminars and workshops represent a nidus of collaboration and knowledge-sharing among
participants. In the Second Aim “to foster multi-disciplinary research by joint educational programs,” the
Program Director seeks opportunities to partner with focus groups and other specialty Divisions to fertilize
ongoing interests in the field. Examples include the partnership with the “Endoderm Club,” which focuses on
organoid systems to model human disease. In this partnership, extramural distinguished speakers can
participate in the Club’s meetings to present and discuss work-in-progress. We also partner with the Divisions
of Developmental Biology and Immunobiology to expose DHC investigators and trainees to the most
successful scientists in the field. Speakers meet with DHC investigators and trainees. In the Third Aim “to hold
an annual scientific symposium to highlight digestive disease discoveries,” the DHC combines the annual visit
of the External Advisory Board with a day devoted to digestive disease research via a highly subscribed
symposium featuring a distinguished speaker and a scientific forum for the presentation of posters reporting
novel findings by trainees and junior faculty. And in the Fourth Aim, “to increase visibility for digestive disease
research in the Academic Health Center” the Program publishes a quarterly Newsletter that is circulated
throughout the academic health center to share information on upcoming seminars, accomplishments and
awards of DHC investigators, and updates of Core services."
10848392,"Bioinformatics Core – Summary 
 The mission of the Bioinformatics Core is to provide bioinformatics support and training for investigators 
within the Vermont Genetics Network (VGN). The Core provides computational analysis of life sciences data for 
all investigators in the VGN network. Many experimental methods produce large data sets requiring the use of 
computational tools to fully analyze them. Modern instruments employed in research projects such as whole 
genome sequencing or cancer biomarker discovery produce protein, RNA and DNA data sets that are too large 
to be analyzed by most bench scientists. The Bioinformatics Core works with investigators and their students to 
provide analyses that help answer questions related to their experimental data. 
 The Bioinformatics Core utilizes a large computer server coupled to a large data storage array for most 
bioinformatics work. The internal infrastructure yields a very cost effective solution for providing bioinformatics 
services. Internal controls are developed on a per project basis to ensure high quality results for all 
investigators. 
 The Core provides experimental design, power analysis, and data analysis in genomics, transcriptomics 
and proteomics. Specifically, the Core assists users from VGN Baccalaureate Partner Institutions (BPI) and UVM, 
as well as others, in proteomics informatics, genomics and biostatistics analysis, functional analysis, software 
and database development, as well as training in bioinformatics and access to shared resources. 
 The Administrative Core will assess performance and the Bioinformatics Core’s impact on the VGN 
mission. It will assist with implementation of best practices identified by the external evaluator, Dr. Joy 
Livingston, the Internal Steering Committee, the External Advisory Committee, and the AAAS Research 
Competitiveness Program consultants. 
 The Bioinformatics Core provides a high level of expertise in bioinformatics, ensuring the support needed 
to design, conduct, analyze, interpret, and manage results requiring or facilitated by informatics applications. 
Continuing to provide these services to our BPIs and through the State of Vermont in INBRE 4 will promote a 
culture of research."
10848395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite advances in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many patients fail to respond to
therapy. Thus, there is a need to find new therapeutic approaches against IBD. The CD40-CD154 pathway is a
known target against IBD and other inflammatory disorders. Clinical trials indicated that CD40 blockade with
anti-CD154 antibodies reduced inflammation. However, the anti-CD154 antibodies caused thrombosis
(unrelated to inhibition of CD40). Moreover, other approaches to cause global inhibition of CD40 are predicted
to increase the risk of opportunistic infections. Identification of a strategy to inhibit CD40-induced inflammation
that does not induce thrombosis or opportunistic infections can be a major advance in the treatment of IBD.
 We uncovered that blocking the interaction between CD40 and an intracellular adaptor protein inhibits pro-
inflammatory responses induced by CD40 while leaving protection against an opportunistic pathogen intact.
We identified a small molecule that binds the adaptor protein, blocks CD40 signaling, reduces pro-
inflammatory responses in vitro and diminishes intestinal inflammation in mouse models of IBD. The compound
did not impair resistance against an opportunistic pathogen.
 The compound has suboptimal solubility and microsomal stability. While some analogs designed to date
showed some improvement in solubility or microsomal stability, further optimization is necessary. The objective
of this application is to develop an optimized inhibitor that will be tested in mouse and human IBD systems.
The central hypothesis is that a potent analog with improved solubility and microsomal stability will optimally
block CD40 signaling, and markedly suppress inflammation in mouse models of IBD as well as CD40-driven
inflammatory responses in intestinal cells from patients with IBD. To test this hypothesis, we will design and
generate analogs of the compound, test their properties, perform signaling studies in reporter cells and
intestinal cells and test the lead inhibitor in animal models of IBD. In the first specific aim we will use structure
activity relationships with the aid of a docking model to design and generate analogs of the compound in order
to improve solubility and microsomal stability. We will examine their ability to inhibit CD40 signaling and their
affinity for the adaptor protein. In the second aim, we will test the most potent analogs to determine if they
inhibit CD40 signaling in vivo. In the third aim, we will determine if the lead analog reduces intestinal
inflammation in mouse models of IBD and inhibits CD40-induced expression of inflammatory molecules in
intestinal cells from IBD patients. The proposed work may lead to a new strategy to treat IBD based on a novel
approach to inhibit CD40 signaling."
10849320,"Cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, are a major cause of death globally. Lipid-lowering therapies
and interventions lower the risk of major adverse clinical events such as myocardial infarction, but significant
residual risk remains. The proposed Program, “Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Atherosclerosis,” seeks
to better understand this residual risk and investigate possible mechanisms and interventions that could further
lower cardiovascular risk. The Program focuses on mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque stabilization and
destabilization, with a focus on macrophages and their functions. Core B, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, will
provide state of the art, coordinated services to the Program as a whole, and thus help the Program achieve its
overall goals. These services include (A) bioinformatic analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data;
B) bioinformatic analysis of CITE-seq data; C) bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA-seq data; and D) biostatistical
support for study design, power, and correlative analyses. All Projects will use Core B services equally. The use
of Core B will enable application of state of the art bioinformatic and biostatistical analyses in consistent,
integrated and coordinated analysis pipelines within and across all three Projects for maximum scientific
inference, translation and impact as well as highest standards of reproducibility and comparison among all
Projects of the PPG Program and for data resource sharing and dissemination."
10849321,"Project Summary/Abstract
As the Mouse and Human Atherosclerosis Tissue Core, Core C will provide a high level of harmonized service
for murine and human atherosclerotic lesion analyses with focus on standardized approaches across the
Program Projects. Core C will coordinate with principle investigators and Core B on biostatistical analyses,
thereby ensuring high scientific rigor and reproducibility across the Program. The shared standardized protocols
and well-trained personnel performing blinded analyses as proposed in Core C proposal are key to minimize
variation related to sample preparation and to provide accurate, objective analyses, which could not be achieved
with each Project functioning as an individually funded program. This will allow for better comparison of the data
and results across the three Projects of the integrated Program. Therefore, the quality and execution of the
proposed studies and successful fulfillment of the specific aims of the full Program are highly dependent on high-
quality, harmonized services from Core C.
Core C is composed of the mouse lesion analyses sub-core located at Columbia University and human lesion
analyses sub-core located at Technical University of Munich through the Munich Vascular Biobank (MVB). The
services provided by the mouse lesion analyses sub-core for mouse lesion analyses include mouse
atherosclerosis tissue sample preparation, sectioning, and staining for various atherosclerosis quantitative and
qualitative lesional parameters. For human lesion analysis Core C and MVB will provide a binary classification
of lesions as stable or unstable based on the Redgrave criteria. Core C also will provide standardized protocols
related to experimental design and sample preparation and characterization to the different investigators for the
more novel or sophisticated technologies such as transcriptomic and spatial transcriptomic assays. All
information obtained via these analyses will be matched to the patient demographic and medical history
information, provided by Core C directly to each Project. Core C also will closely work with project PIs and Core
B to provide any required information for samples in a blinded fashion to maintain scientific rigor in biostatistical
analyses. Core C will receive advice and instructions from Core A and the executive committee comprising the
PIs) on assignment of priorities for sample analysis. Core C also will learn and help address potential technique
questions or issues in sample preparation or assays that could occur in research progress of each project,
effectively communicate with all Projects and see whether this could be a common issue that can be addressed
coordinately.
Taken together, the unbiased, standardized and harmonized high quality services provided by Core C will be
key for the successful execution of the proposed studies and to meet the specific aims of the full Program."
10849322,"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) arises from somatic mutations such as in JAK2 or TET2 that provide a fitness
advantage to hematopoietic stem cells and outgrowth of clones of blood cells. CH, which increases in frequency
with aging, has emerged as a major independent risk factor for CVD. Studies in Tet2-/- and Jak2VF mouse models
indicate a central role of macrophage inflammasome activation. In collaboration with Drs Tabas and Reilly, we
have shown increased atherosclerosis, defective efferocytosis, increased necrosis and inflammatory myeloid
cell populations in mice expressing Jak2VF in hematopoietic cells. Inhibition of the inflammasome product lL-1β
improved features of plaques stabilization including increased fibrous caps and decreased necrotic cores. The
overall hypothesis is that in several forms of CH including Jak2VF and Tet2, inflammasome activation and IL-1
release from mutant cells promote adverse changes in WT Μφs and stromal cells to induce plaque
destabilization. These studies will synergize with those proposed by Drs Tabas and Zhang that are probing the
mechanisms of defective efferocytosis and thinning of lesional fibrous caps which are key features of
atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and the major PPG theme. In Aim 1 we will assess the impact of Jak2VF-CH
on bystander cells in lesions focusing on CH Μφ - WT Μφ crosstalk. We will use scRNAseq to evaluate the
hypothesis that IL-1 secretion from Jak2VF Μφs reduces efferocytic Trem2Hi Μφs and increases inflammatory
Μφs. We will employ novel Trem2 stabilizing antibodies to block Trem2 cleavage by IL-1, introduce a transgenic
non-cleavable form of MerTK developed by Dr Tabas and in collaboration with Dr Zhang introduce deficiency
of Pdcd6ip a novel negative regulator of efferocytosis, to see if these potential therapeutic approaches improve
efferocytosis, necrotic core and fibrous cap formation. In Aim 2 we will assess the impact of Jak2VF- and Tet2-/--
CH on Μφ-fibroblast crosstalk. scRNAseq and SMC fate mapping with Dr Reilly shows that IL-1β inhibition in
Jak2VF and Tet2 CH mice increases non-SMC-derived fibroblasts in fibrous caps. We will use fate mapping
studies to assess the hypothesis that fibroblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Aim 3 will
involve translational studies in human carotid plaques. We will collaborate with Dr Maegdefessel, Tabas, Zhang
and the Munich Vascular Biobank to test the hypothesis that CH mutations in TET2, JAK2 and DNMT3A are
associated with increased inflammatory Μφs and decreased Trem2Hi Μφs in carotid plaques with adverse impact
on features of plaque stability. Cells expressing inflammatory or pro-resolving genes will be visualized at single
cell resolution in advanced vs early plaques and in unstable vs stable plaques. These collaborative studies may
reveal novel genes and pathways acting downstream of inflammasome activation in clonal hematopoiesis to
destabilize plaques and point to new and more precisely targeted therapeutic approaches that are less
immunosuppressive than global inhibition of IL-1β or inflammasomes."
10849359,"ABSTRACT
The Kansas Institute for Precision Medicine (KIPM) fosters medical advancements by facilitating the next
generation of basic and physician-scientists, shaping their research ideas with a
precision medicine
focus, and
making them highly competitive for national peer-reviewed funding. The KIPM Phase 2 COBRE will continue our
successful efforts to train the next generation of translational research leaders in areas such as education,
research, and healthcare. The KIPM has become a major pillar of the University of Kansas Medical Center
(KUMC) and region by raising awareness and advancing precision medicine efforts to transform healthcare for
patients suffering from various disease states. To continue our mission, we propose the following Specific Aims:
1. Recruit and mentor outstanding junior investigators in diverse research disciplines focused on advancing
precision medicine to improve patient outcomes. In a rigorous pre-selection process, four promising junior
investigators, i.e., Research Project Leaders (RPLs), were selected from over a dozen applicants all of which
had a research theme directly related to precision medicine. Decisions were based on the content of research
proposals and training potential that were evaluated by our leadership team, including the three PIs of the
proposed COBRE and current External Advisory Committee members. Each applicant has identified at least two
internal and one external mentor with expertise related to their area of study. All Phase 2 COBRE RPL candidates
contributed to discussions regarding infrastructure necessary to enhance their projects via one-on-one meetings
with the PIs and Research Core leaders to help shape infrastructure needs to enhance their research capacity.
2. Evolve the established organizational structure and institutional support to realize a cohesive and sustainable
program in precision medicine at KUMC. The administrative structure for the KIPM Phase 2 COBRE will be
facilitated by a multi-PI leadership of 3 seasoned researchers with complementary expertise and the additional
expertise afforded by a newly formed Advisory Committee. Continued institutional support of over $1M annually,
including expanded pilot grant funding, will help sustain and advance the KIPM’s mission to improve patient
outcomes by training physicians/scientists in precision medicine. 3. Enhance basic and translational research
with a precision medicine theme through a strong research core infrastructure. Three research cores, i.e.,
Biomedical Engineering (BME), Biobanking and Biomarker Validation (BBV), and Quantitative ‘OmiCs’ (QOC)
Cores, will support RPLs and the Pilot Projects Program (PPP) as well as serve the extended research
community in Kansas and beyond. Unique to the KIPM is patient engagement through our established Patient
and Community Engagement (PACE) resource, which provides ‘just-in-time’ mentorship to COBRE RPLs and a
broad range of researchers, emphasizing how to partner and communicate key features of precision medicine
to patients and community members from diverse backgrounds. Together the KIPM Phase 2 COBRE will
“advance education and support discoveries that will transform healthcare in our region and beyond.”"
10849323,"In human atherosclerosis, a positive-feedback cycle in lesional macrophages (Ms) involving efferocytosis
(clearance of apoptotic cells [ACs]) and inflammation resolution is impaired, promoting clinically dangerous
""unstable"" plaques with thin fibrous caps. When LDL is lowered, however, the cycle is ""reawakened"", plaques
stabilize (""regress""), and CAD risk is lowered, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Based on data from
our lab and others, our overarching hypothesis is that resolution pathways in regressing lesional Ms are acti-
vated by efferocytosis-induced metabolic changes, promoting cap thickening/plaque stabilization by cell-auton-
omous pathways and by crosstalk with collagen-producing stromal cells involved in cap formation (capSCs).
This hypothesis is directly linked to the central PPG theme on M-cell autonomous and M-stromal cell crosstalk
mechanisms that affect plaque stability, and our approach is highly dependent on our collaborations with Drs.
Tall and Zhang, the Cores, and shared models. We will explore integrated, efferocytosis-induced pathways that
promote cap thickening in regression and are functional in human Ms. Aim 1 explores how AC-methionine
drives DNA-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) to methylate/repress Dusp4, which enhances pro-resolving signal-
ing and further amplifies efferocytosis. DNMT3A loss-of-function (LoF) variants are a common cause of clonal
hematopoiesis (CH), but mechanisms are poorly understood. Our published and preliminary studies suggest a
new mechanism. Aim 2 explores how AC-nucleotides drive efferocytosis-induced M proliferation (EIMP), which
expands the pool of resolving Ms to promote regression. EIMP requires another pathway in which efferocytosis
induces lactate (EIL). Aim 1 will explore 3 hypotheses related to the DNMT3A pathway: (1) methylation/repres-
sion of Dusp4 by DNMT3A is a key step in resolution in effero-Ms in vitro and in athero-regression (Tall/Zhang);
(2) DNMT3A LoF impairs athero-regression in DNMT3A-CH mice and correlates with unstable plaques in hu-
mans with DNMT3A-CH (Tall/Zhang/Core C). We will also test a mechanism-based nanotherapy in DNMT3A-
CH mice using lesion-targeted pro-resolving nanoparticles; and (3) crosstalk between effero-Ms undergoing the
DNMT3A pathway and smooth muscle cell-derived cells (SDCs) promotes regression by enhancing SDC con-
version to fibromyocytes (FbMs) to promote cap thickening (Tall/Zhang/Reilly/Core B). Aim 2 will investigate
the following hypotheses related to EIMP/EIL: (1) EIMP expands the pool of TGF-producing Ms, which pro-
motes cap thickening by enhancing SDC-to-FbM conversion, and EIMP is impaired in unstable vs. stable human
plaques (Tall/Zhang/Reilly/Cores B/C); (2) the EIMP and DNMT3A pathways are linked, as the DNMT3A path-
way enhances EIMP via ERK (Zhang); and (3) EIL promotes capSCs to stabilize plaques by enabling EIMP and
possibly through a direct effect of lactate on SDC-to-FbM conversion, and EIL is associated with plaque stability
in humans (Tall/Zhang/Reilly/Core C). We reason that studying these pathways in the overall PPG framework
will provide new insights into mechanisms of plaque stabilization and how this insight may inform new therapies."
10849324,"Lipid-lowering approaches reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD), but significant residual risk
remains. Macrophage (Mφ) accumulation and defective phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by Mφs,
i.e., defective efferocytosis, promote atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and subsequent acute cardiovascular
events. Enhancing efferocytosis represents a potential therapeutic strategy for residual risk reduction in ACVD.
Discovering novel genes that can be harnessed to enhance efferocytosis addresses a major knowledge gap and
provides opportunities for new ACVD therapeutics. As discovered in our genome-wide CRISPR screen of
efferocytosis regulators, Pdcd6ip deficiency enhances Mφ efferocytosis, representing a novel therapeutic
opportunity in atherosclerosis and management of CVD residual risk. Preliminary data show that transplantation
of Pdcd6ip-/- mice bone marrow into atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr-/- mice increases features of plaque stability. This
PPG project will test the central hypothesis that Pdcd6ip acts as a molecular break on Mφ efferocytosis and
can be harnessed to ameliorate athero-progression or to promote athero-regression through effects on plaque
stabilization, the central theme. Integrating with Drs. Tall and Tabas, the project will assess the therapeutic
impact of Pdcd6ip inhibition on atherosclerosis with clonal hematopoiesis (CH) mutations, with implications for
inflammation-related residual risk in CH patients. Aim 1 will determine how Pdcd6ip deficiency enhances
efferocytosis in vitro in murine and human Mφs. Our data show that Pdcd6ip-/- induces cytokinesis arrest and
increased formation of polyploid Mφ that demonstrate superior capability of continuing efferocytosis, suggesting
a “super-eater” phenotype. Mononuclear Mφs with Pdcd6ip-/- also show enhanced primary efferocytosis, though
not continuing efferocytosis. We will test the hypothesis that Pdcd6ip deficiency enhances efferocytosis via both
polyploidy-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Aim 2 will determine if harnessing Pdcd6ip inhibition
enhances efferocytosis to ameliorate athero-progression or to promote athero-regression in mice. We will
determine: (A) whether Pdcd6ip deficiency ameliorates progression via converting proliferating Mφs to “super-
eater” polyploid Mφs, including in JAK2-CH mice; and (B) whether Pdcd6ip deficiency promotes regression via
enhancing efferocytosis-resolution cycle, including in DNMT3A-CH mice. Using fate-mapping and scRNA-seq,
we will also address how Pdcd6ip deficiency promotes plaque stability via Mφ and stromal cell crosstalk (with
Drs. Tall, Tabas, Reilly, Cores B&C). Aim 3 integrates the histological, clinical, transcriptomic, and spatial
transcriptomics data of biobanked human plaques in the Munich Vascular Biobank (Dr. Maegdefessel, Core C)
to prioritize potential efferocytosis regulators identified in our genome-wide CRISPR screen that are associated
with human atheroma. The prioritized genes will accelerate mechanistic studies and support the translational
promise of enhancing efferocytosis for residual risk reduction in ACVD, particularly in CH patients. In summary,
our work will provide insights into new approaches to enhance Mφ efferocytosis and mitigate residual ACVD risk."
10849015,"ANIMAL MODELS SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
Animal models are powerful tools that are vital to translational cancer research. The Georgetown Lombardi
Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Animal Models Shared Resource (AMSR), directed by Christopher
Albanese, PhD (DC), comprises three components: rodent, zebrafish, and the Preclinical Imaging Research Lab
(PIRL). Andrew Nelson, DVM (NJ), and Patricia Foley, DVM (DC), manage the rodent component; Eric Glasgow,
PhD (DC) manages the zebrafish component; Albanese directs the PIRL. The function of AMSR is to facilitate
the efficient, economical, state-of-the-art use and imaging of animals for the performance of cancer-related
studies. This is accomplished through resources situated at both LCCC Consortium sites in DC and NJ, where
highly trained faculty and staff provide access to animal services to LCCC Members. Significant emphasis is
placed on assisting users with the design, performance, and imaging of studies using vertebrate models
extending from zebrafish to genetically engineered and immunodeficient rodents. Major services in the rodent
component of the AMSR include establishing and managing xenograft, patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and
orthotopic models; performance of surgical procedures; mouse colony management; monitoring tumor growth
and metastasis; blood collection; necropsy procedures; and administration of drugs or other compounds and
delivery of specialized diets. Services for zebrafish include generation and maintenance of genetic models;
toxicity screening; and xenotransplantation experiments (i.e., “zevatars”—zebrafish avatars. Animal studies are
performed within Georgetown University’s (GU) Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM) and a centralized
animal facility in NJ, both accredited by AAALAC International. Imaging services provided by the AMSR allow
monitoring of tumor initiation, progression, metabolism, and response to therapy. Imaging equipment includes
high-resolution, in vivo and ex vivo, small animal imaging and image analysis using a new (April 2021) Bruker 7
tesla magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy console secured with an NIH Shared Equipment grant (NIH
S10 OD0251531), a new (March 2020) small animal ultrasound (VisualSonics Vevo 3100) workstation to
supplement the existing Vevo 3100, a mouse DEXA instrument (Lunar PIXImus) and bioluminescent and visible
to near-infrared Lumina spectroscopic imagers. The AMSR works closely with the Histopathology & Tissue
Shared Resource, the Microscopy & Imaging Shared Resource, and the Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Shared
Resource to support its users in correlating in vivo data with pathologic, genetic/genomic, molecular,
mechanistic, and statistical analyses. In FY22, the AMSR supported 26 LCCC Members across all three
Research Programs (10 Cancer Cell Biology [CCB], 15 Cancer Host Interactions [CHI], and 1 Cancer Prevention
and Control [CPC] Member). During the current funding period, the AMSR contributed to 33 publications, of
which 8 are in high-impact journals, and provided support that enabled the success of 42 extramurally funded
research project grants."
10849016,"FLOW CYTOMETRY & CELL SORTING SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
Flow cytometry is a mainstay technology required to support a dynamic range of basic science and clinical
biomedical research programs across scientific disciplines. The Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting Shared Resource
(FCSR) provides an array of options for both (1) cell analysis and (2) cell sorting required for functional cellular
analysis or downstream molecular inquiry. Due to the nature of FCSR services, flexible on-site flow cytometry
facilities are vital to maintain the viability of sorted cells and to perform time-sensitive analysis that supported 30
Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Members in FY2022. Over the current project
period the FCSR has been transformed into a multi-site Shared Resource (SR), which now provides NJ-based
LCCC Members access to on-site FCSR services. Led by Director Karen Creswell, PhD and Manager Yuanyuan
Tian, PhD, who oversees FCSR operations on the NJ campus, the FCSR support staff (three FTEs) provide flow
cytometry services, experimental and panel design, and post-acquisition analysis. The development of new
methodologies is also prioritized to ensure researchers have access to the most current flow cytometry services.
Creswell and Tian have integrated and standardized FCSR services across the Consortium. The FCSR provides
value to research projects by separating cells based on transfection-based markers, stem cell panels, and
additional cell surface and intracellular markers. Functional assays for cell cycle, apoptotic status, and oxidative
stress are performed in addition to immunophenotyping. Immunophenotyping of mouse and human tissues and
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has improved due to the 16-color capabilities of the BD LSRFortessa and
the 28-color capabilities of the BD FACSymphony A3 cell analyzer. The FCSR receives input from the FCSR

HAZMAT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS TRAINING PROGRAM
The Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (P2R) Consortium is comprised of dedicated experts in
safety disciplines critical to the nation's health and well-being. Guided by a shared vision – to reduce
work-related harm and improve disaster preparedness and response – and an external advisory board of
devoted and experienced professionals, the P2R Consortium serves as a resource for workers,
responders, and residents across the country with a targeted focus on the population of United States
Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Regions 5, 6, and 8. The objective of each
training course is (1) to reduce work-related harm and, therefore, is part of the Hazardous Waste Worker
Training Program, HWWTP, or (2) to improve disaster preparedness and response and, therefore, is part
of the HazMat Disaster Preparedness Training Program, HDPTP.
Building on past successes and using evidence-based techniques to identify high-risk industries and
communities, the Consortium's HDPTP projects an annual delivery of approximately 170 courses to
reach over 22,000 responders (including residents) for an impressive impact of more than 330,000 hours
of training. By delivering this training, the public health impact of the P2R Consortium is a knowledgeable
workforce and community with the skills and confidence to recognize and mitigate hazards, thereby
protecting health and well-being. Finally, as in the past, the P2R Consortium places special emphasis on
building the capacity of vulnerable communities to respond to environmental and work-related threats."
10851008,"AFC HDPTP Project Summary
 A disaster, by definition, is an unexpected destructive event that brings harm and damage to a
community. While the community members often feel powerless to control the disaster, they can take steps to
prepare for their response if it occurs. AFC proposes to use funds from the NIEHS Worker Training Program’s
Hazmat Disaster Preparedness Training Program (HDPTP) to provide preparedness training to public safety
responders in the southeast US and to Native American tribes throughout the country. The proposed project
will continue AFC’s ten-year history with of delivering quality training focused on safety for first responders to a
disaster, whether natural or man-made. This project will target public safety (fire, law, EMS, EMA) responders
with training that helps them recognize hazards, assess response actions, and bring some order to the chaos
of the disaster scene. Disasters often become mass casualty incidents (MCI) and responders may need triage
their limited resources to do the most good. Also, unfortunately, these MCI events may be “man-made” acts of
terror in which the perpetrator of violence is still at the scene. AFC proposes to bring Hostile Event Response
training that teaches enhanced situational awareness and survival as well as life-saving tactical “stop-the-
bleed” care in an active shooter or improvised explosive device event. AFC projects to bring a total of 70
classes to 1,400 trainees in 11,200 contact hours. It will be split between both the public safety and Native
American target populations."

 Funding is requested to acquire a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer for MALDI Imaging
Mass Spectrometry (MALDI IMS) in support of multiple NIH-funded programs at UC Irvine. The
instrument is based on a AP-MALDI-QTOF design optimized for imaging by high-speed, high
resolution acquisition of mass spectra from raster laser scanning of matrix-coated 2D specimens.
MALDI IMS provides a proven technique capability of retaining spatial information alongside high
dimensional ion mass detection. Supported projects originate from researchers in the Schools of
Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, Medicine and Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical
Sciences. The instrument will, therefore, be truly a shared inter-disciplinary resource. Projects of
the major users include, 1) neuropathological proteins and lipid phenotyping in Alzheimer’s
disease models, 2) investigating metabolic heterogeneity in tumors, 3) evalauting ECM
composition of engineered cartilage, 4) defining age/environmental changes of lens cyrstallins, 5)
spatial plant metabolomics and 5) assessing lipid/protein distributions in dry eye syndrome. All
the projects are pursuant of highly defined goals where the spatial organization of biomolecules
(metabolites, lipids, peptides/proteins) is a critical component for understanding the molecular
organization and function or dysfunction of tissues.
 For optimal access, maintenance and expert operational support, the instrument will be placed
in UCI’s Mass Spectrometry Core Facility. UCI has long supported the MSF with permanent
funding for full-time facility staff members: a PhD-level director with >30 years experience as a
multidisciplinary research scientist, complemented by a proteomics specialist with expertise in
MALDI and LC-MS techniques, and an instrument operator. Normal facility operational funds are
obtained though a well established stable recharge system. Additional extended service support
is provided through pledged institutional funds. All 20 instruments in the Facility are intensively
used, particularly for small molecule analysis, top down proteomics and metabolomics with most
available 24/7 as walk-up open access instruments. In fiscal year 2021-2022 the facility analyzed
>35K samples by 300 users, with many users receiving advanced instrument training. The
MALDI-IMS instrument will be run as a staff-operated service but also made accessible to
qualified trained users to maintain a high sample throughput and maximum use. The research
outlined in the proposal highlights an urgent need for an advanced but user-friendly instrument
that is not currently available at UCI; a fast MALDI-QTOF IMS system for high quality biomolecular
spatial phenotyping."
10854490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mural cells, including pericytes and smooth muscle cells, are critical for vascular development, function, and
stability. Dysregulation of mural cells can lead to vascular abnormalities, emphasizing the need for generating
functional mural cells to explore novel therapeutic approaches in vascular disorders, tissue repair, and
regenerative medicine. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising method for obtaining
patient-specific mural cells; however, conventional chemical-based differentiation methods are limited in scope
and precision. Inducible transcription factors (TFs) have gained traction as a differentiation strategy, offering
precise temporal control and the potential for simultaneous differentiation of multiple cell types. However,
identifying TFs for mural cell differentiation remains challenging. Our overarching goal is to develop TF-driven
strategies for the effective differentiation of human iPSCs into competent vascular cells for regenerative
medicine. Our group previously demonstrated the successful generation of vascular endothelial cells (iECs) from
iPSCs using ETV2, a pioneer TF. More recently, we identified that another TF, NK3 Homeobox 1 (NKX3.1),
facilitates the generation of mural progenitor cells (iMPCs) from iPSCs. These iMPCs display crucial mural cell
characteristics and mature into fully differentiated mural cells upon interaction with ECs. Our group has also
developed a novel vascular organoid (VO) model that allows concurrent co-differentiation of iPSCs into iECs and
iMPCs and facilitates the maturation of iMPCs. Our central hypothesis is that NKX3.1 dictates mural cell lineage
fate, and its activation can effectively generate iMPCs, introducing a novel method for creating an unlimited
supply of functional mural cells for regenerative medicine. To test these hypotheses and elucidate the
mechanisms underlying NKX3.1-driven mural cell differentiation and maturation, we propose three specific aims.
In Aim-1, we seek to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of iMPC specification using NKX3.1. Aim-2 delves
into the mechanisms of mural cell maturation in the VO model, examining how EC interactions affect iMPC
maturation. In Aim-3, we seek to evaluate the therapeutic potential of iMPCs in ischemic tissues, determining
whether iMPCs can act as a source of functional perivascular cells in vivo, supporting EC engraftment and
contributing to the stability of newly generated blood vessels. We anticipate that these investigations will uncover
the molecular underpinnings of mural cell lineage determination and functionality, ultimately advancing our
understanding of mural cell development and therapeutic potential. This knowledge will pave the way for patient-
specific strategies for treating vascular disorders and advancing vascular regenerative medicine."

This proposal requests funds for a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope for the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center (BRC)
Imaging Facility. Currently the imaging facility has two inverted confocal microscopes that are heavily used (average 58
hrs/week for the past two years). The 13-year old Zeiss LSM710 has become obsolete. Though it is still functioning, Zeiss
will no longer guarantee repairs or parts for it. A new confocal microscope is critical to ensuring imaging capacity for our
many NIH researchers at Cornell on the Ithaca campus. Additionally, the requested confocal microscope will have
capabilities that are not currently available on campus, including the fast Airyscan module, the AI sample finder and near-
IR (NIR) detection capabilities. We are requesting a non-linear optical (NLO) capable unit, and will be integrating the
system with an existing multiphoton (NLO) source as well as its associated existing Zeiss beam routing and detection optics.
Data management, scheduling and billing will be accomplished using already established BRC infrastructure. Training will
be carried out by a PhD level staff scientist. The microscope will be available to all researchers on and off campus, and
will advance a broad segment of NIH-funded research programs generally by ensuring sufficient confocal capacity, and
specifically by providing new capabilities for projects requiring fast tiling at high resolution, fast intracellular dynamics,
and the ability for imaging NIR-emitting fluorophores."
10860928,"Project Summary
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 new
pediatric cancer diagnoses. Though mortality and morbidity associated with common ALL subtypes have
drastically improved as a result of advances in chemotherapy and risk stratification, high rates of treatment failure
persist in understudied subtypes of ALL, such as early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL).
ETP-ALL patients fail the first month of chemotherapy at 7.7x the rate of non-ETP ALL patients and are twice as
likely to have detectable residual disease at end of induction chemotherapy. We hypothesize that these striking
differences in response to treatment are intrinsically rooted in biological characteristics of ETP-ALL, which can
be further revealed using high-throughput measurement tools, such as single-cell genomics.
The completion of COG’s AALL00344 clinical trial, which enrolled 325 ETP-ALL patients, represents an exciting
opportunity to improve our understanding of ETP-ALL and identify the biological reasons for treatment failure. In
Aim 1, we will use single cell transcriptomics and single cell chromatin accessibility to investigate clonal diversity,
transcriptomic features and epigenetic signatures in 30 patients with ETP-ALL. We will seek to place ETP-ALL
blasts in context of healthy T-cell development and other pediatric leukemias. In Aim 2, we will compare ETP-
ALL patients based on clinical response and use patient-specific xenograph models to functionally perturb genes
and pathways enriched in non-responding patients. Our project is poised to synergize with bulk sequencing data
being generated for 325 ETP-ALL patients through an NIH X01 grant (HD100702-01), specifically due to our
ability to deconvolute bulk sequencing data using subclone-specific signatures discovered in single cell data.
We believe the proposed work can help to elucidate the genetic drivers of ETP-ALL and identify targets and cell
populations associated with treatment failure, thus significantly impacting the diagnosis and treatment of ETP-
ALL."

recognizes that a key characteristic of successful BHI researchers is the ability to play a leadership role in
translating methods and models from the computing, information and behavioral sciences into tools and solutions
for information related challenges and opportunities to improve health for individuals, communities, nationally
and globally. The vision of BHI at UW is to promote research, education (and their translation into practice) to
unleash the potential for electronic biomedical data and information to advance research and improve health. In
that context, BHI trains future research leaders in the field with translational skills and interdisciplinary expertise
across the domains of translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, clinical informatics, consumer
health informatics and population/public health informatics. The UW training program consists of: a) a core
curriculum of foundational concepts in the field that reach across the disciplines (drawing on computer science,
information science, statistics and data science), b) core domain courses (biological, clinical, consumer and
public health), c) methodology courses (research methods, teaching and communication), and d) individualized
in-depth electives in foundational and domain areas. In the data science domain, we offer a regular and advanced
data science option and a growing multidisciplinary campus-wide medical data science research initiative. To
maintain its success in recruiting and fostering success for students and faculty, UW BHI proposes to continue
the NLM research training program, seeking funding to support 15 trainees for the next funding cycle. As we
continue to grow and evolve our program, we plan to expand our interdisciplinary research collaborations while
continuing to grow the faculty body, leveraging BHI's leadership role in precision medicine, research informatics,

10861059,"Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is a constellation of human-reported urinary indications, including urgency, intermittent and weak urinary stream, incomplete bladder emptying, and increased voiding frequency. A major cause of male LUTD is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is medically managed with five alpha reductase inhibitors or alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Neither drug reduces symptomatic progression by more than 34% and most of these elderly men have no option but surgery. Prostatic obstruction of urine flow can lead to bladder detrusor overactivity (DO), a poorly understood disease with largely ineffective therapeutic options. The medical management of LUTS due to prostate and bladder dysfunction has seen little improvement over the past 40 years because we have failed to capture the cell type-specific molecular alterations that would provide actionable therapeutic targets. This proposal will address fundamental barriers to deriving molecular mechanisms of human LUTD. In Aim 1 we will produce multi-omic data on cell type-specific molecular changes in human LUTD. We will link the data to a tissue repository managed with OpenSpecimen software, giving researchers searchable access to >3,000 clinically annotated normal and diseased human specimens. In Aim 2 we will engineer new mouse strains to achieve Cre expression in specific bladder, urethra, and prostate stromal cells. It is not possible with existing mouse strains to overexpress or knockout a gene in a bladder stromal cell without introducing the same genetic change in prostate and urethra, or vice versa. Accordingly, the unique contributions of prostate and bladder to urinary voiding cannot be isolated. We will overcome this problem by creating new mouse strains with selective inducible Cre expression in fibroblasts and smooth muscle. Finally, we will ensure that all resources are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) by incorporating all methods, tools, data and protocols into the NIDDK ATLAS Data Center. The proposed resources are significant because they establish foundational bedside to bench resources to generate and test hypotheses about LUTD mechanisms in human tissues and rationally designed mouse models."

Matrix Metalloproteinases 2 and Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP2/9) have been shown to play active roles in a
variety of cellular responses, including the regulation of uterine contraction. The underlying molecular
mechanisms driving these effects are currently unknown. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand
the mechanisms by which MMP9 promotes uterine contraction and to determine if specific inhibition of MMP9
promotes uterine quiescence. The central hypothesis is that elevation of MMP9 to levels seen in preterm
patients is sufficient to increase the contractile response in human uterine tissue and drive preterm parturition.
This proposal will determine if purified MMP9 promotes uterine contraction and if specific inhibition of MMP9
promotes uterine quiescence in term and preterm human uterine tissue. Experiments will be performed to
determine if MMP9 inhibition can delay parturition in preterm animal models. Finally, this proposal will
determine if MMP9 inhibition promotes uterine quiescence by decreasing intracellular calcium transients and
apply proteomic technologies to identify novel mechanisms of MMP9 action. These data are expected to be
significant because these they will provide the foundation for future experiments to determine if MMP9 or
related pathway inhibitors can serve as druggable targets to promote uterine quiescence and reduce the

This is a request for Jess Protein Analysis System (Protein Simple) to be integrated into the New York Medical
College (NYMC) for protein quantitation and characterization. NYMC is dedicated to building biomedical
research. A key part of NYMC Strategic Plan is improving investigator-identified critical core research facilities.
Surveys of NYMC funded investigators, including those funded by NIH and those funded from other sources,
consistently rank a protein analysis system that may quantitative and reproducible results as the most essential
core piece of equipment for their current and future research, especially in the absence of a functional
proteomics core. The proposed ProteinSimple Jess System integrated into the College Histological Laboratory
and Imaging Core will meet a tremendous unmet need for investigators for state-of-the art automated size-based
separation and nano-immunoassay platform for the detection and characterization of proteins molecular weights
in denatured protein from tissues, cells, and extracellular particles (extracellular vesicles and extracellular
condensates). The research of many of the Major and Minor Users at NYMC involves analysis of gene
expression at the protein level and the enhanced signal to noise ratio provided by the ProteinSimple Jess System
is essential. Currently there is not a functional proteomics core at NYMC. The proposal includes 4 NIH-funded
Major Users from various departments and disciplines at NYMC. NIH funded users comprise 100% of the
estimated Accessible User Time (AUT) for the instrument. The other users comprise additional investigators with
critical need for quantitative and reproducible results. There is no functional protein analysis core or equipment
at NYMC. All investigators depend on traditional western blotting that is plagued by poor reproducibility, lack of
accurate quantitation, extensive time to result and reliability issues. All Major/Minor Users have agreed that the
ProteinSimple Jess System will best fit the current/future needs of investigators to provide more quantitative and
reproducible results, thus, meeting established guidelines on NIH’s reproducibility and rigor. In addition to the
automation, sensitivity, and throughput advantages of the ProteinSimple Jess System, the system creates
electronic data files that are impervious to manipulation, as it contains the raw and analyzed data, which can
easily be uploaded to a data repository when it comes time to publish. In summary, the ProteinSimple Jess
System promotes data reproducibility because it precisely controls sample loading, antibody additions,
incubations, and all washes, thereby eliminating the inconsistencies and user-dependent variability that
may be introduced during traditional western blotting, culminating in intra-assay Coefficients of
Variability (CVs) <15%."

The majority of people diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) die of their disease, despite
availability of active standard chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapies, and allogeneic transplantation. We
have found that we can probe mitochondrial apoptotic signaling of patient myeloblasts to identify active
therapies in AML using BH3 profiling. Prior exploitation of BH3 profiling led to the FDA approval of venetoclax
in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine. Here we present an innovation, Dynamic
BH3 Profiling, which we propose to use to identify active single agents as well as combinations in AML. High
priority will be given to combinations with BH3 mimetic drugs. We will also include in our studies candidate
small molecules that emerge from the other Projects. Promising candidates will advance to clinical trials in
collaboration with Clinical Core 3. For the first time, we propose to accelerate novel clinical trials in AML by
using dynamic BH3 profiling to prioritize combinations that drive high apoptotic signaling in patient myeloblasts.
In prior work, we have found that BH3 profiling can predict response to induction regimens in AML. We have
installed BH3 profiling in a clinical laboratory where we can now test over a hundred AML samples per year.
Building on our prior work, and working with Biostatistics Core 2, we will construct predictive biomarkers based
on BH3 profiling for response to standard 7+3 induction, as well as to the newer venetoclax plus azacytidine.
We will test inclusion into our predictive tool information like ELN criteria, age, and pathology. The expected
output is a set of predictive tools that will offer likelihood of CR/CRi for individual patients for both induction
regimens. It is hoped that this tool will help guide patients to the induction therapy that is best for them.
While we exploit the concept of apoptotic priming to predict clinical response and identify active regimens in
AML, we know little about the molecular determinants of the apoptotic priming phenotype. We will utilize
genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic tools to investigate the differences between myeloblasts in different
states of apoptotic priming. While this work will focus on AML, it is expected that it will reveal principles of
molecule determination of priming that will be applicable to other cell types."
10836445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CBL mutations are common in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
myelodysplastic syndrome, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CBL is an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that recognizes phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and mediates both downstream
signaling and destruction of activated RTKs that are critical for leukemogenesis, including KIT, FLT3 and
CSF2RB. (1, 2) There are no therapies that specifically address CBL-mutant leukemia, an ideal target for
genotype-directed therapy. CBL is a central node for kinase signaling, and unlike most common mutations in
leukemia, CBL mutations result in a gain-of-function, activating specific signaling pathways. CBL-mediated
ubiquitination of activated tyrosine kinases triggers their proteasomal degradation, a negative feedback for
ongoing signaling. In leukemia, CBL mutations specifically abolish the ubiquitin ligase activity, leaving CBL-
mediated downstream signaling unchecked, resulting in prolonged kinase signaling and increased cellular
proliferation. The central goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanistic basis of CBL mutations in order
to identify the set of proteins and pathways that are dysregulated and can be targeted for the treatment of CBL-
mutant leukemia. In Aim 1, we will determine the specific phosphorylated proteins that are degraded by CBL in
leukemia cells and stabilized when CBL is mutated, leading to constitutive signaling. Mechanistically, we will
examine how specific point mutations in CBL alter the binding and ubiquitination of substrates, and the initiation
of downstream signaling. In Aim 2, we will investigate the combinations of kinase inhibitors with greatest
therapeutic potential using both in vitro and in vivo models. Preliminary studies highlight the aberrant activation
of LYN kinase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in cells with CBL RING domain mutations. We hypothesize
that inhibiting these signaling pathways, and other kinases identified in Aim 1, will selectively target CBL-mutant
cells and may have therapeutic activity in CBL-mutant myeloid malignancies. We will develop and characterize
in vivo models of CMML with Cbl mutations, and test the efficacy of FDA approved drugs, dasatinib and
dactolisib, alone and in combination. In Aim 3, we will investigate the biology of the CRL5CISH ubiquitin ligase.
Preliminary studies identified CRL5CISH ubiquitin ligase as a potential reserve for CBL, regulating an overlapping
set of signaling pathways, but also degrading key signaling molecules that are not degraded by CBL. We will
examine the biology of this CRL5CISH ubiquitin ligase in CBL wild-type and mutant cells. Manipulation of the
activity of this ubiquitin ligase could alter ubiquitination of substrates that are aberrantly regulated in CBL-mutant
leukemias. Overall, this project will elucidate the biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities in CBL-mutant leukemia.
The project will leverage the expertise in ubiquitin ligase biology in the Ebert laboratory and across the P01.
Since the pathways that are activated in CBL-mutant leukemias are signaling pathways, the recent development
of drugs that target protein kinases will enable rapid clinical translation of the findings."
10836446,"Project Summary
Despite marked progress in the rate of cure among patients with acute leukemia, a diagnosis of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) portends a poor prognosis for pediatric and adult patients, especially for high risk subsets of
AML, such as MLL-rearranged or NMP1 mutant AML. Creative approaches to identifying and characterizing new
therapeutic targets are critically needed.
New insights into the biology of AML reveals alterations in multiple epigenetic regulators that drive oncogenic
transcriptional programs. In this proposal, therefore, we consider AML a disease of a dysregulated transcriptome.
We hypothesize that activation of transcription factors drives cancer cell proliferation and blocks differentiation.
As such, new studies from our laboratories and others have clearly identified dependencies on several
transcription factors (TFs), and specifically zinc finger (ZnF) TFs, that influence aberrant gene regulation in AML.
Using a multidisciplinary approach that combines chemical biology and leukemia biology, we will explore the
efficacy of degrading the ZnF TFs IKZF1, IKZF2 and ZFP64 with immunomodulatory-based drugs (IMiDs) in
AML.
First, we will further explore degrading IKZF1 with lenalidomide in combination with the epigenomic inhibitors of
DOT1L and MENIN. While inhibition of either DOT1L or MENIN alone causes AML cells to differentiate, co-
treatment with lenalidomide induces cell death. Now, we seek to understand the molecular mechanisms
governing this synergistic effect in order to guide combination drug therapy in the clinic. Second, we will explore
degradation of IKZF2, which we have recently identified as a TF that drives leukemia stem cell self-renewal while
inhibiting differentiation. We hypothesize that selective degradation of IKZF2 will lead to rapid cell differentiation
and death. We will model IKZF2 degradation in AML in order to study the biological effects as well as test new
molecules that can degrade IKZF2 directly. Third, we will exploit our medicinal chemistry and chemical biology
platform to develop degraders selective for ZFP64, a newly described TF that directly controls the expression of
MLL fusion oncoproteins. Using our expertise in IMiD-based drugs, we will screen for and optimize degraders of
ZFP64 to test in AML cells.
The immediate objective of this research is to functionally characterize the role of ZnF transcription factors in
AML, leveraging a highly collaborative Program of Investigators in chemical biology, structural biology, leukemia
biology, cancer modeling, and epigenome science. The long-term goal is to increase AML cure rates by targeting
gene regulatory pathways."

The Clinical Research Support Core 3 is dedicated to two major efforts. First, we are responsible for obtaining
human samples from patients with myeloid malignancies at the time of diagnosis and relapse as well as at
specific timepoints in clinical trials for ancillary studies. The diagnostic and relapse samples are used to perform
research in each of the four projects. Thus, human leukemic blasts can be assayed for their ability to undergo
apoptosis in response to various agents are described in Project 1 including BH3 profiling, both standard and
dynamic. In Project 2 the importance of CBL in leukemogenesis will be assessed; the studies conducted in the
Ebert lab will elucidate how downstream pathways activated by this mutation may represent therapeutic targets.
Project 3 investigates the role of SALL4B in leukemia. The Armstrong/Fisher labs (Project 4) are investigating
transcription factor biology relevant to mechanism of leukemogenesis in MLL rearranged leukemia. We
anticipate that menin inhibition in combination with either lenalidomide and/or venetoclax will have therapeutic
potential. Clinical Research Support Core 3 will be obtaining samples from patients at various stages of their
disease who have signed consent for 01-206 which allows for sample banking. We will obtain these samples
and transfer them to Biospecimen Core 1 for annotation and availability for scientists in the projects. The second
major goal of the Core 3 is to perform clinical trials emanating from science described in the grants. We
anticipated three major clinical trials during the grant funding period. In years 2 and 3, we expect that we will be
performing a trial dedicated to confirming the dynamic BH3 profiling will allow selection of specific kinase
inhibitors to be combined with venetoclax in the treatment of patients with advanced relapsed/refractory AML.
We plan to further compare the outcome of patients treated with a kinase inhibitor plus venetoclax with those
treated with “standard” venetoclax plus hypomethylated agent. Project 2 will lead to a clinical trial involving
venetoclax in combination with dasatinib, capable of inhibiting the LYN/SRC pathway activated in cells with a
CBL mutation. Preliminary data suggests that menin in combination with either lenalidomide and/or venetoclax
may be synergistic in MLL rearranged leukemia-which will lead to a clinical trial toward the end of the funding
period. The clinical trial designs including the timing and processing of ancillary samples to confirm target
engagement, will be informed with the assistance of Biostatistical Core 2. Biostatistical Core 2 will also assist in
the analysis and publication of these clinical trials. It is hoped that through collection of carefully annotated
samples for use in relevant assays within the projects will lead to a greater understanding of leukemia biology,
and perhaps lead to additional targets that can be exploited. The clinical trials will hopefully improve the outcome
of patients with leukemia."
10836487,"Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (phosphoinositides) are a type of membrane bound
phospholipid that impact multiple diverse processes required for megakaryopoiesis and the
activation of platelets. We have recently published in Developmental Cell that phosphoinositides
in neuronal cells initiate intracellular trafficking by recruiting effector proteins such as GOLPH3
that are involved in vesicular fusion and budding of plasma membranes during Golgi biogenesis.
Since megakaryocyte α-granules are derived from the trans-Golgi network and Multi-Vesicular
Bodies, I hypothesize that phosphoinositide signaling is necessary for the intracellular trafficking
required for the biogenesis of α-granules. PhosphatidylInositol Transfer Proteins (PITPs) are
members of a small protein family that bind and transfer phosphoinositide monomers from one
cellular compartment to another and thereby enable phosphoinositide synthesis. We have made
the unexpected observation that the two predominant PITP isoforms found within
megakaryocytes, PITPα and PITPβ play previously unrecognized but essential roles in the
trafficking of cargo from the Multi-Vesicular Body to α-granules. Loss of PITP-mediated
phosphoinositide synthesis produces morphologic defects similar to what is seen in humans with
Gray Platelet Syndrome. The overall hypothesis of this Proposal is that phosphoinositide signaling
mediated by PITPs is necessary for the membrane dynamics and protein trafficking required for
the biogenesis and maintenance of megakaryocyte α-granules. In Aim 1 of the Project, we will
rigorously analyze the discrete biochemical properties of individual PITP isoforms in
megakaryocytes. Our preliminary data shows that the two PITP isoforms control phosphoinositide
signaling through biochemically distinct mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will determine how
phosphoinositide signaling contributes to alpha granule biogenesis and function. In conjunction
with Project 2, we will test the hypothesis that phosphoinositide synthesis within discrete
microdomains of megakaryocytes and platelets regulates effector proteins such as NBEAL2 (the
mutated protein responsible for the Gray Platelet Syndrome). This signaling cascade modulates
NBEAL2’s ability to mediate membrane dynamics and protein trafficking. We will also analyze in
detail the functional roles of α- granules with ex vivo rheologic and ultramicroscopy studies that
will be performed with Project 2, in vivo thrombosis studies with Project 3, and in vivo inflammation
studies with Project 4."
10836488,"Project 2: Summary
Platelet αIIbβ3 has been considered the prototypic integrin whose quintessential feature is its
nearly instantaneous conversion from an inactive bent conformation on circulating platelets to an
extended ligand binding conformation following vascular trauma. This global reorganization is
initiated by platelet agonist-stimulated biochemical reactions that disrupt an intramolecular clasp
composed of portions of the αIIb and β3 cytosolic, transmembrane, and extracellular stalk
domains. Recent work suggests that αIIbβ3 is not representative of all integrins and that various
integrins differ in the stringency of their regulation. Unlike αIIbβ3, some integrins may be
constitutively active. Project 2 addresses topics related to the protein-protein interactions that
maintain integrins in their basal states, intra-molecular interactions in Specific Aim 1 and inter-
molecular interactions in Specific Aim 2. In Specific Aim 1, intramolecular constraints located in
the interface between the αIIb and β3 extracellular stalks will be identified using a novel structural
bioinformatics method to predict interacting interfacial “hot spots”. The relative importance of the
predicted hot spots will then be determined by expressing hot spot mutants in CHO cells and in
iPSC-derived human megakaryocytes produced in collaboration with Project 4. This experimental
approach will then be used to compare αIIbβ3 to the integrins αvβ3, α2β1, and αvβ8 and in
collaboration with Project 1, to characterize the interaction between the PH and BEACH domains
of Nbeal2 in studies designed to understand the pathogenesis of α granule defect in the gray
platelet syndrome. A second set of integrin constraints located in the transmembrane domain
interface will be studied based on preliminary data indicating that β3 uses different motifs to
interact with αIIb and αv. Novel computational methods will then be used to derive two-
dimensional kinetic parameters for these interactions in collaboration with Project 3. Lastly, we
will use high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to correlate our computational and experimental
results with the global conformation of full-length integrins. Specific Aim 2 will the identify and
quantitively evaluate the protein-protein interactions responsible for αIIbβ3-mediated fibrin clot
contraction. The studies are based on the observation that agonist stimulation causes platelet
calpain activation and the degradation of platelet cytosolic proteins, in particular the proteins talin
and vinculin that link αIIbβ3 to the actin cytoskeleton. Proposed studies will test the hypothesis
that talin cleavage by calpain enables vinculin binding, thereby generating sufficient traction force
to contract αIIbβ3-bound fibrin clots. This hypothesis will also be tested in vivo using mouse
thrombosis models and calpain-deficient mice in collaboration with Project 3."
10836491,"Project 3 Abstract
Platelet activation is critical for hemostasis and a contributing factor in thrombosis. Although recent studies have
highlighted roles for platelets in diverse processes, the rapid accumulation of large numbers of platelets remains
the hallmark of hemostasis and arterial thrombosis, and is the major focus of this project. Our recent studies in
the mouse microvasculature show that the hemostatic response to small injuries produces a relatively simple
structure in which a core of fully-activated platelets is overlaid by a shell of less-activated platelets. Dense
packing in the core acts as a molecular trap, establishing an environment in which diffusion replaces convection.
This structure allows thrombin and other agonists to form overlapping gradients that produce regional differences
in platelet activation and fibrin distribution. Recognizing that transport is regulated by platelet packing density is
a paradigm shift, suggesting that platelet procoagulant activity arises from forming a sheltered environment and
not just from phospholipid exposure. We believe that this concept is key to understanding the impact of
antiplatelet agents and the events of arterial thrombosis. Testing it calls for scaling up to larger injuries in larger
vessels, and for extending our analysis from mice to humans and from hemostasis to thrombosis, all with a
hybrid experimental and computational approach that integrates with and supports the other projects in this PPG.
Aim #1 will examine the spatial and temporal distribution of platelet activation at high resolution, measure
transport in the gaps between platelets, and examine the hemostatic response in large arteries and veins. The
initial results show a more complex architecture with regions of greater and lesser platelet activation and packing
density, and large differences between the luminal and abluminal surfaces. Our subcontract with Brian Storrie at
the University of Arkansas will allow 3-dimensional reconstruction of larger hemostatic thrombi at the sub-micron
level. In collaboration with Project 4 we will examine the impact of sepsis and systemic inflammation on platelet
function in vivo and support studies on the impact of the PF4-directed antibody, KKO. Studies with µ- and m-
calpain deficient mice will support work in Project 2, but also be part of understanding the role of clot retraction
in limiting transport through larger hemostatic structures. Aim #2 will examine the mechanisms that shape the
hemostatic plug, testing the hypothesis that hemostatic structure requires tight regulation of the extent of platelet
activation and the delivery of platelet cargoes deep within the hemostatic mass. Studies on NBEAL2-/- (gray
platelet syndrome) mice and the “empty a-granule” mice developed in Project 1 will allow us to examine the role
of secretion on hemostatic plug architecture. Aim #3 will determine whether the ordered hemostatic structure
that we have observed in mice applies to humans, and how it differs in arterial thrombosis as compared to
hemostasis. The human studies will be performed in vivo with Penn trauma surgeon, Carrie Sims, and ex vivo
using a novel microfluidics device developed with Dan Huh in Penn’s School of Engineering. Studies of human
arterial thrombi will be done in collaboration with Project #2 co-investigator John Weisel."

Sepsis is a multi-organ, dysfunctional response to infection. PROJECT 4 focuses on the role of released
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), its ability to entrap microbes, and NET-degradation products (NDPs, e.g.,
cell-free DNA and histones) in organ damage, and on the interactions of the cationic chemokine, platelet factor
4 (PF4) and the polyanion heparin with NETs. On presentation, many septic patients have an overwhelming
amount of released NETs so that preventing NET release (NETosis) by blocking peptidylarginine deiminase 4
or accelerating NET lysis would be ineffective in preventing morbidity and mortality. We propose that in sepsis
NET stabilization, enhanced microbe entrapment, and/or NDP sequestration would be protective. Our studies
have defined three related strategies that can achieve one or more of these goals. We propose to better
understand the underlying mechanism(s) of these strategies, hemostatic/thrombotic implications, and their
potential therapeutic efficacy. Specific Aim (SA) #1: Understanding small, positive protein effects on
NETs. PF4 and other small, positive proteins (e.g., protamine sulfate (ProSO4)) compact NETs, decreasing
their lysis by DNases. PF4, but not ProSO4, prevents NDP release, an important difference between these
cationic proteins that will be explored to understand the impact of compacting NETs in sepsis. PF4 enhances
microbe entrapment and protects the endothelium from NET injury. Whether ProSO4 similarly effects NET
biology given that it releases NDPs will be pursued in a microfluidic system and in murine endotoxic/sepsis
models. Both cationic proteins will be compared to or in conjunction with other NET-directed therapeutic
options. The side-effects of these cations, especially on hemostasis, will be explored. Pilot trials of canine and
human (h) PF4s will be infused in dogs with spontaneous peritonitis with the long-term goal of a clinical trial in
this large animal sepsis setting. SA#2: Studies on enhancing the effect of PF4 on NETs. We have found
that a monoclonal antibody KKO that enhances PF4 binding to NETs further increases DNase resistance. An
Fc-modified KKO variant protects against NET deleterious effects in vitro and in mice models of sepsis. The
underlying mechanism(s) of how KKO, and other anti-PF4 antibodies effect NET biology will be defined. KKO
infusion studies will be pursued in mice expressing hPF4 looking at efficacy and thrombotic complications and
in pilot studies of co-infused KKO and hPF4 in septic dogs. SA#3: Understanding ODSH effects on NETs in
sepsis. We have previously shown that the desulfated heparin ODSH, which has markedly lower anticoagulant
effects than heparin, is protective in a histone infusion murine model and will explore its mechanistic basis in
vitro and in murine sepsis models as in SA#1. We will continue a dose escalation study on the efficacy of
ODSH in dogs with spontaneous peritonitis to define maximal tolerated dose for an eventual clinical trial.
These studies in PROJECT 4 should advance our understanding of the interactions of PF4 and heparins with
NETs in sepsis and lead to novel therapies for this devastating clinical state."

The goal of this U19 Genomic Center for Infectious Disease (GCID) application is to use state-of-the-art model
systems to address gaps in knowledge surrounding the genomics of multiple NIAID Category A-C bacterial, viral,
fungal, and parasitic mucosal pathogens. The Organoid and Minibioreactor Array Cultivation (OMAC) core will
assist in achieving this goal by (1) generating, maintaining, and providing experimentally ready and customized
intestinal and airway organoid cultures for the individual projects, (2) providing complex microbial communities
from the intestine and airway customized for use by individual projects in experiments exploring how the
microbiome affects pathogenesis, and (3) developing new tools, models, and platforms for use by the individual
projects to explore additional aspects of intestinal and airway biology that may affect infectious disease
pathogenesis. The centralization of these activities in the OMAC core allows the provision of critical biologically
relevant human organotypic and bacterial cultures that are essential for the success of the project and ensures
standardization and reproducibility. These reagents will facilitate the translation of genomic analysis by validation
of key outcomes. Centralization will also result in a reduction in labor, supplies, and equipment costs ultimately
resulting in time and cost savings for the overall center. Due to the use of the core by all Center projects, the
core stands as a central unifying element that connects the projects. As a result, the OMAC core will enhance
interproject communication and enable the comparison of center wide results. The establishment of the OMAC
core will be an essential aspect of the success of the Center."

The central goal of this Training Grant in Critical Care Health Policy Research is to train leading academic
physician investigators who are capable of improving the quality, safety, equity, and costs of critical care
delivery at the bedside, across populations, and alongside policymakers. Since its inception in 2010, this
program has trained or is currently training 26 such physician investigators. Among many metrics of our
success to date, of the 16 postdoctoral fellows who have completed their training, 13 (81%) remain active in
clinical research and either have or are on track to receive appointments as Assistant or Associate Professors
at leading academic medical centers. This application proposes to continue and enhance our program.
As a core part of this training program, fellows pursue the Master of Science in Health Policy Research
(MSHP) degree program offered by Penn's School of Medicine and its Wharton School of Business. The
program has been highly successful in attracting, training, and graduating fellows from its first nine cohorts.
Trainees receive an intensive, structured program of mentoring, didactic research training, and experiential
research over two years. The program includes core courses in health economics, health policy, qualitative
methods, and statistics; elective courses in advanced epidemiology or biostatistics, advanced health care
economics, health care policy, statistics, survey design and measurement, social policy and demography, and
grant writing; intensive mentoring in critical care health policy research by an extensive set of experts in the
field; participation in multidisciplinary research and professional development seminars; instruction in the
responsible conduct of research and regulatory affairs; and the development and completion of research
projects in critical care medicine supervised by a multidisciplinary mentoring team.
The program is designed for postdoctoral physician fellows with clinical experience in adult and pediatric
critical care. The definition of critical care encompasses care for adults and children with severe acute medical
problems, trauma, and post-surgical care in intensive care units (ICUs), cardiac care units, and emergency
departments. It also includes the examination of strategies to improve care for patients at risk for requiring an
ICU admission, and to improve long-term outcomes for patients who survive an admission and their families.
The program emphasizes research designed to answer policy-relevant questions regarding how critical care is
and ought to be organized, financed, managed, and delivered. This work is typically conducted by fellow-led
teams that build upon and enhance Penn's traditions of collaborative and interdisciplinary science."
10854747,"ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death and most common cancer occurring
in females in the U.S. Numerous large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that use of exogenous progestins
(synthetic progesterone [P4]) increases the risk of invasive breast cancer in females. Although it has been
clearly established in the literature that P4 plays a role in the development of human breast cancer, the
mechanism by which P4 promotes breast cancer tumorigenesis remains unknown. Recently, we reported a link
between progesterone receptor (PR) and immune signaling pathways. Our recent publications have
demonstrated that P4/PR can repress type I interferon signaling pathways in human breast cancer cells. Given
these findings, we sought to investigate whether P4/PR drive immunomodulation in the mammary gland to
promote formation of mammary gland tumors. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that P4
and PR decrease recruitment and function of DCs in the mammary gland, which promotes immunosuppression
and subsequent development and growth of mammary gland tumors. We will address this hypothesis through
the following specific aims: 1) Define the mechanism by which P4 treatment and PR expression affect DC
recruitment to the murine mammary gland and PR+ mammary gland tumors; 2) Characterize the maturation
and activity state of DCs isolated from P4-treated PR+ mammary gland tumors; and 3) Determine the
contribution of P4-mediated DC suppression to mammary gland tumor growth. For aim 1, we will utilize single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to determine if P4 affects the release of cytokines involved in DC
recruitment to mammary gland tumor cells. In aim 2, we will determine how P4 treatment affects the activity
and function of tumor-infiltrating DCs using syngeneic tumor models, in which markers will be measured via
scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and T cell proliferation assays. Aim 3 will utilize transgenic mouse models to
determine whether depletion of DCs impacts P4’s growth-promoting effects on mammary gland tumors.
Successful completion of the proposed work will provide novel insight into immune tolerance mechanisms
promoting the development and growth of breast cancers. Additionally, it will provide a rationale to target
P4/PR signaling with anti-progestins to promote DC function and enhance immune-mediated elimination of
tumor cells."
10861734,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous
system (CNS), and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most commonly used animal
model of MS. Although emerging data have suggested the contribution of TFR-TFH-GC B-antibody (Ab)
responses to EAE and MS, the contribution of TFR cells to the disease pathogenesis and the nature of Ab
response remain largely unknown. Effector Tregs (eTregs) including TFR cells must maintain their suppressive
anergic phenotype at non-lymphoid tissues, including the CNS, and during ongoing inflammatory responses.
However, the mechanisms that ensure maintenance of anergy, lineage identity and expression of regulatory
activity by eTregs are not well defined. Our recent publication has revealed that expression of the transcription
factor Blimp1 in eTregs, including the TFR subset, is essential for maintenance of FoxP3 expression and stable
eTreg suppressive activity. The pro-inflammatory potential of Blimp1-deficient eTregs has prompted us to
examine their impact on the CNS autoimmunity using the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced
EAE model. We observed that mice with a FoxP3-specific ablation of Blimp1 developed severe EAE, failed to
recover and all succumbed to paralysis compared to controls, which reflected conversion of unstable Blimp1-
deficient eTregs into IL-17A/GM-CSF-producing effector T-cells (Teff) associated with enhanced glycolysis and
loss of suppression on TFH-Ab responses as well as aberrant microglial activation. Surprisingly, serum IgE
titers were positively correlated with EAE scores and these mice had more IgE deposition in the CNS.
Moreover, compared to healthy controls (HC), MS patients had reduced circulating Blimp1+ Tregs and TFR cells
expressing lower levels of Blimp1 and IL-10, associated with elevated IgE levels. We hypothesize that Blimp1
expression enforces eTreg stability under CNS autoimmunity by preventing acquisition of effector activity and
metabolic skewing as well as restraining TFH-Ab response. Using combined transcriptomic, epigenomic and
metabolic assays, we will delineate the mechanisms by which eTregs, TFR cells and Ab responses regulate
neuroinflammation and how loss of Blimp1 in eTregs re-shape the CNS microenvironment. The proposed
study will uncover Blimp1 as a new regulator that is important for eTreg stability and for mediating disease
recovery during CNS autoimmunity. Our findings point to a previously unrecognized mechanism enforcing
eTreg stability by coordinating response to the autoimmune milieu and maintaining metabolic fitness via
regulation of Blimp1. This study also has the potential to reveal the unappreciated role of TFR cells, and to
clarify the role of B-cells and Ab responses (particularly IgE) in the regulation of CNS autoimmunity. Insights
from these studies may provide critical strategies to formulate novel therapeutic approaches to MS by
exploiting a surprising aspect of the biology of a critical T-cell subset."

There is a strong public health need to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in its earliest stages and predict who is
most vulnerable to clinical progression. The goal of this K23 proposal is to provide the candidate with the
experience, knowledge, and technical expertise to independently investigate novel early predictors of risk for
and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline. The career development plan comprises a complementary
set of training and research activities to support the candidate’s transition to independence. Specific training
goals include: 1) to develop expertise in using electroencephalography (EEG) to assess brain network
dynamics in aging populations; 2) to increase depth of knowledge of functional neuroanatomy, with a focus on
frontal networks compromised early in the course of AD; 3) to gain specialized training in clinical research
design and statistics, with an emphasis on dimension reduction and analysis of complex data; and 4) to receive
formal mentorship in professional development. The training plan draws on an exemplary interdisciplinary team
with expertise in the electroencephalography (S. Jones), cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroanatomy
(Heindel), statistical methods and the cognitive reserve hypothesis (R. Jones), and clinical neuropsychology
(Tremont). Training activities will take place through formal mentorship, experiential laboratory training,
didactics, and the completion of a rigorous research project. The scientific objective of the research project is
to investigate behavioral and electrophysiological markers of frontal control network integrity that may serve as
novel markers of risk for and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline. Each research aim corresponds to
a complementary area of training. Specific aims include 1) to examine behavioral and electrophysiological
markers of frontal network dynamics in older adults at risk for AD; 2) to validate the behavioral and
electrophysiological markers using independent measures of frontal network integrity (i.e., magnetic resonance
imaging); and 3) to validate the markers as indices of cognitive resilience. The research project will leverage
the infrastructure of the Rhode Island Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention Registry, a large cohort of older adults
whose cognition is monitored annually. Successful completion of these interrelated training and research
activities will foster the candidate’s development into an independent clinical researcher with expertise in the
early prediction of risk for and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline."

Background. Visual impairment has been strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD) in numerous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and we have found that worse
baseline vision is tied to increasingly higher risk of subsequent dementia. Neurosensory deprivation from
visual impairment may place greater demands on cognitive resources, accelerating cognitive decline and
increasing the incidence of cognitive impairment. Conversely, improving vision could improve cognitive
outcomes by increasing neurosensory input and reducing cognitive demand for processing visual
information. Cataracts are the most common cause of visual impairment—fortunately reversible with
surgery, however, we have found that ADRD patients are only half as likely to undergo cataract surgery as
those without ADRD. This may reflect concerns regarding less potential benefit and greater perceived risks.
Objectives. Our long-term goal is to evaluate cataract surgery as a potential intervention to “bend the
curve” for risk of ADRD onset and progression, including optimizing patient selection and timing for surgery.
The objective of this proposal is to investigate how cataract surgery may affect incidence and progression of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD, develop models to predict individual patients’ ADRD/MCI
outcomes following cataract surgery, and identify key confounders, mediators, and effect modifiers. We
hypothesize that cataract surgery is associated with (1) reduction in incidence of new MCI and ADRD and
(2) reduced cognitive decline and impairment progression among patients with baseline MCI or ADRD, and
that (3) we will be able to predict individual patient outcomes. We propose to use methods our group has
developed to archive and analyze electronic health record (EHR) data, to develop a curated data set and
achieve three Aims: (1) Determine impact of cataract surgery on ADRD and MCI incidence; (2) Determine
impact of cataract surgery on cognitive decline and impairment among patients with baseline ADRD or MCI,
and (3) Develop patient-level predictive models for ADRD and MCI outcomes after cataract surgery.
Impact. EHR-based machine learning analysis has not been applied to ADRD research to date, and the
influence of cataract surgery on cognitive outcomes is not yet known. Finding that a widely-available cataract
surgery intervention improves cognitive outcomes would be transformative. We estimate a potential unmet
need for cataract surgery affecting almost 350,000 patients annually—just among the subset of patients with
existing Alzheimer’s disease. Results from this work will directly inform discussion of cataract surgery risks
and benefits and will also facilitate future research, including pragmatic clinical trial design. By developing and
disseminating open source EHR-based algorithms to identify and classify cognitive and visual impairment,
this proposal will enable investigation of other ADRD risk factors and interventions, eye disease research, and
a more precise approach to managing individual patients."
10861736,"Inter-organ crosstalk via endocrine hormones is a fundamental feature of mammalian metabolic physiology. Disruptions of hormonal signaling have been linked to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We recently discovered Neuregulin 4 (NRG4) as a fat-derived hormone that is reduced in mouse and human obesity. Using gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, we demonstrated that NRG4 preserves metabolic health by acting on the liver to attenuate hepatic lipogenesis and stress-induced liver injury. These findings illustrate a novel adipose-hepatic hormonal axis mediated by NRG4 in metabolic signaling and disease pathogenesis. The non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) of the liver represent approximately 30% of total liver cells and play an important role in tissue homeostasis, hepatic metabolism, and disease progression. To delineate the landscape and regulation of liver cell heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on NPCs isolated from healthy and diet-induced NASH mouse livers. This single-cell analysis revealed unprecedented insights into transcriptomic reprogramming of liver cells during NASH pathogenesis. Based on a body of preliminary data, we hypothesize that NRG4 signaling shapes the liver microenvironment to impinge on the progression of NASH and its associated liver disease. In this proposal, we plan
to delineate how NRG4 regulates the transcriptomic and functional properties of liver cells at single-cell resolution. We will determine the mechanisms and significance of the regulation of hepatic immune cell landscape by NRG4 in mediating its effects on NASH pathogenesis. Finally, we plan to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting NRG4 for the treatment of metabolic liver disease."
10831439,"Project 1 - SUMMARY
The clinical syndrome heart failure (HF) continues to be a major health problem world-wide. It is an end-point
after cardiac injury/stress, which is usually preceded by cardiac hypertrophy and adverse ventricular remodeling.
Over the last two decades, our laboratory has studied HF development with a focus on the role of G protein-
coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. In particular, we are interested in how GPCR kinases (GRKs) regulate
normal and diseased myocardial signaling and function. These kinases canonically regulate GPCRs via
phosphorylation causing desensitization and a loss of response. GRK2 and GRK5 are the major GRKs
expressed in the heart and both have been found to be up-regulated in failing human myocardium and also in
animal models. Recently, we have identified a non-GPCR role for GRK5 in the heart as a pathological facilitator
of hypertrophy and the maladaptive transition to HF via its localization and activity in the nucleus of
cardiomyocytes. In fact, hypertrophic stress induces nuclear translocation of GRK5 where it can act as a Class
II histone deacetylase (HDAC) kinase causing de-repression of hypertrophic gene transcription through MEF2.
In addition, GRK5, in an apparent non-catalytic manner, can facilitate nuclear NFAT activity on hypertrophic
gene transcription. Of interest, GRK5 has been shown to bind to DNA directly and new preliminary data has
identified several gene targets via chromatin precipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The pathological nature
of GRK5, a least in pressure-overload, appears to be primarily through its nuclear localization, which appears
dependent on calcium-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM) binding to a region within the amino-terminus of GRK5 (GRK5nt).
What isn’t known is whether GRK5 or its nuclear activity participates in cardiac pathology after ischemic injury
and this will be determined in this proposal where we have preliminary data suggesting increased GRK5 in
myocytes plays a novel role in post-ischemic HF via regulation and modulation of immune cell infiltration and
inflammation. Interestingly, this pathology differs significantly from that of GRK2. We have existing and novel
mouse models available to us to determine the role of nuclear GRK5 in HF and whether its pathological
mechanisms involve pathways and gene targets that do not require the catalytic activity of GRK5. These models
will be employed in this Project to investigate these novels aspects of GRK5 in HF development post-stress and
to test our Central Hypothesis that GRK5 plays a critical (patho)-physiological role in the heart’s response to
injury and targeting and manipulating its unique cellular localization and/or activity in myocytes is a novel
therapeutic repair strategy for the injured heart. Our associated Specific Aims are: [1] to determine the DNA/gene
targets of nuclear GRK5 in hypertrophy and determine whether kinase activity is involved in its gene regulation;
[2] To determine if a translational approach can be employed therapeutically to limit pathological nuclear GRK5
activity; [3] To determine the mechanistic action of GRK5 in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemic injury
and how this specifically differs from GRK2-mediated injury."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality across the world in both men and women,
however, abundant data from the literature underscore a significant disparity between men and women for
the incidence and severity of CVD. It has been observed that men undergo more rapid progression of heart
failure, less preservation of myocardial mass as they age, and worse age-matched cardiac contractility
compared to women. Moreover, women are exposed to a lower ischemic heart complication than age-
matched men both in the reproductive and postmenopausal age. These protection remain present even in
neonatal, prepubescent and postmenopausal populations where there is greater homogeny of hormones
between males and females indicating that although gonadal hormones do have an impact on differing
incidences of disease processes among men and women, there is more to the equation. The underlying
mechanisms responsible for this gender disparity beyond recognized effects of female sex hormones remain
understudied. Stem cell-based therapies, particularly those employing bone marrow progenitors, have
emerged as a potential novel therapeutic approach in ischemic tissue repair however patient population for
available clinical trials remain disproportionately biased towards inclusion of male patients (approximately
80% male subjects). Whether gender influences EPC/stem cell reparative properties has not been well
studied. Recently however, evidence has begun to emerge that gender does influence the functionality of
stem/progenitor cells, although mechanisms for such functional disparity are poorly understood. Our
preliminary studies indicate that bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from female mice are more
efficient than those from male mice in the repair and angiogenesis in ischemic heart. Additionally, our data
indicates that molecular basis of this functional dimorphisms partly depends upon different epigenetic
landscape in cells from different genders which appears to be independent of sex hormones including
estrogen. Therefore our central hypothesis is that female derived BM- EPCs possess superior reparative
properties than their male counterparts and that functional superiority of female EPCs involves both
estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent signaling and molecular mechanisms including a differential
epigenetic landscape. This project aims to study, in detail, phenotypic, epigenetic and molecular basis of
gender-specific differences in EPC reparative properties. This overall aim will be achieved by conducting
experiments organized under the following three specific aims: 1) To determine the role of gender dimorphism
on EPC -mediated post-MI repair; 2) To elucidate epigenetic mechanisms of functional disparity between
male and female EPCs; and 3) To test the therapeutic efficacy of gender specific-EPC- derived exosomes as
cell-free modality for post-MI repair."

HF affects 6.5 million Americans, with almost 1 million new cases per year and costing over $30 billion in
healthcare resources. Renal dysfunction (RD) is common in HF, with a reported prevalence over 50%, and is
a major risk factor for death. Ultimately, cardiac dysfunction promotes renal fibrotic remodeling and
progressive HF-induced RD, a pathophysiologic condition known as cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). Importantly,
RD in HF is a potent marker of decreased survival, outperforming traditional metrics of HF disease severity like
ejection fraction and functional class, however fundamental research into the mechanisms behind this process
are limited. A number of factors preceding fibrosis contribute to the development of CRS, including changes in
hemodynamics, neurohormones, cytokines and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. Responsive to
each of these changes are leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes,
some of which have been implicated in CRS. However, few reports have investigated whether they play a
reactionary or causative role in the development of CRS-induced renal dysfunction and remodeling in response
to HF or how to mitigate their impact in this process. We hypothesize that leukocytes play a fundamental role in
regulating CRS, and since RD remains a strong independent predictor for poor prognosis in HF patients,
understanding the role of leukocytes and the molecular changes they undergo during CRS progression may
offer new strategies by which to alleviate patient mortality. Therefore, we will determine the temporal- and
subtype-specific leukocyte infiltration profiles in relation to changes in cardiac and renal structure and function
during CRS progression, the impact of their deletion at specific timepoints, as well as perform a dynamic single
cell transcriptome analysis of renal cells during CRS and transcriptome analyses of peripheral blood
leukocytes from mice and humans with clinically-manifested CRS. In addition, our lab recently showed that
modulation of leukocyte-specific β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) expression or signaling alters leukocyte
targeting and responsiveness to injury in a GPCR kinase (GRK)/β-arrestin (βarr)-dependent manner. Thus, we
will define the impact of leukocyte-specific β2AR-dependent signaling on CRS progression and determine how
genetic deletion, pharmacologic inhibition or GRK/βarr-biased modulation of leukocyte β2AR signaling impacts
CRS development and progression. Completion of this project will generate new molecular and physiologic
insight toward the detection and treatment of HF-induced CRS via targeting of leukocyte-dependent processes
and responsiveness."

Mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) overload is a central event in myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF),
causing metabolic derangement, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) activation, genetic
reprograming and loss of cells due to necrosis. The Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter Channel (mtCU) is the
primary mechanism for mCa2+ uptake, located at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and physiologically
is required for activation of mitochondrial energetic pathways to support contractility during stress (fight-or-flight
response). The mtCU is a multiprotein high-MW channel, ~400-800 kD in size, containing pore-forming,
scaffold and regulatory components. Given the critical roles in metabolism and cell death it is of great scientific
interest to understand the mechanisms regulating mCa2+ uptake. We recently reported that conditional genetic
ablation of MCU, the pore forming subunit of the mtCU, is cardioprotective in an in vivo model of ischemia-
reperfusion (IR) injury, providing evidence of translational potential. Recently a gene paralog of MCU,
CCDC109b (MCUB), was identified as a component of the uniporter and is theorized to negatively regulate
mCa2+ uptake. However, no genetic or in vivo studies have investigated this gene and it's mechanism of action
remains unknown. Given the therapeutic value of deciphering uniporter channel regulation, this proposal will
examine the molecular function of MCUB, and its contribution to mCa2+ dynamics in cardiac physiology and
disease using in vitro and in vivo genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches. We hypothesize that MCUB is
a stress-responsive regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by modulating the composition (members and
stoichiometry) of the mtCU and that therapeutic manipulation of MCUB will reduce pathogenic mCa2+ uptake, as
occurs in IR injury and heart failure (HF)."

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only known treatment that has resulted in durable
HIV-1 remission/functional cure as shown in the Berlin Patient, and most recently also in the London Patient.
Both of these patients were treated for associated malignancies; significant improvements are needed in order
to apply these case studies to a broader population of HIV+ individuals. Our U19 consortium is focused on
enhancing the anti-HIV function of gene-edited HSPC, and safely engrafting these cells in vivo. The Nonhuman
Primate (NHP) Core will play a central role in organizing all large animal studies proposed by each project in our
group, with a focus on approaches that are most suitable for future trials in patients. We will work closely with
Project 3/Cannon and Project 4/Kiem to adapt an optimized protocol to gene edit HSPCs, with a focus on
maximizing homology directed repair (HDR). In Project 1/Scadden, Project 2/Magenta, and Project 4 Kiem, we
will apply and evaluate this approach in a total of 40 NHPs. Each animal will receive autologous, HDR-modified
HSPCs containing either barcoded, gene-edited CCR5 alleles (∆CCR5), or a “three for one” product containing
both CD4CAR∆CCR5 and eCD4-Ig∆CCR5 HSPCs. To evaluate the efficacy of our strategy, we will model HIV
infection in NHPs, using simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). In one study design, 24 animals will be
transplanted with gene edited HSPCs, followed by SHIV challenge to quantify protection against virus
acquisition. To model HIV persistence, 16 animals will be infected with SHIV and suppressed by antiretroviral
therapy (ART) prior to HSPC transplantation. Following recovery, animals will be removed from ART, and the
kinetics and magnitude of SHIV rebound will be compared to untransplanted control animals. In addition to
CD4CAR∆CCR5 and eCD4-Ig∆CCR5 HSPCs, animals will also receive a nongenotoxic conditioning (NGC)
regimen designed by Project 2/Magenta, and bone marrow cryogel (BMC) developed by Project 1/Scadden.
These additional treatments will substantially enhance the safety and efficacy of our approach, respectively. The
NHP Core will implement both of the SHIV study designs described above, produce gene edited NHP HSPC
products, and provide supportive care following HSPC gene therapy and infection with SHIV. The large animal
studies we direct on behalf of each project will contribute meaningfully to discussions regarding synergies
between projects, and selection of the best combinations to forward to early phase clinical studies."
10831500,"Abstract
 The cure of HIV using hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant is supported from the
experience of the `Berlin patient'. Recent results from patients in London and Düsseldorf are very
encouraging and potentially bolster transplant as a cure for HIV. What remains a challenge is to
reduce the complexity of hematopoietic stem cell transplant so that it may be more readily adopted
in settings that are not acutely life threatening such as chronic HIV disease. Gene editing will
make autologous cell transplant possible thereby eliminating the devastating complication of graft
versus host disease and address limited availability of allogeneic CCR5 ∆32/∆32 donors. However,
`conditioning' to enable stem cells to engraft the marrow is highly toxic and requires resource
intensive hospitalization as currently practiced.
 We aim to develop nongenotoxic conditioning (NGC) that leverages antibody drug conjugates
(ADCs) to specifically target and deplete hematopoietic cell populations as a niche sparing
method with reduced toxicity. By investigating ADCs that are HSPC-specific (anti-CD117
targeting) or more broadly immune depleting (anti-CD45 targeting), we aim to identify the optimal
NGC strategy for enabling efficient HSC transplant in immunodeficiencies. We will combine our
ADC-based conditioning with autologous gene-modified cell transplants in animal infection
models to identify a lead strategy with translational value. The specific aims of this project are:
Specific aim 1. Optimize the dose and schedule of treating NHP with anti-CD117 ADC to achieve
durable donor chimerism.
Specific aim 2. Optimize the dose and schedule of treating NHP with anti-CD45 ADC to achieve
durable donor chimerism.
Specific aim 3. Determine whether nongenotoxic conditioning and gene-modified HSC
transplant enable disease control in infected animals.
 If successful, this project will provide specific interventions that can lower the barrier for gene
modified HSC transplantation as an approach to cure HIV/AIDS."

Although hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation now underlies two clinical cases of HIV-
1 remission/functional cure, a means to apply this approach to a wider array of patients has not yet been
identified. In this project, we will address a key limitation for HSPC-based anti-HIV strategies: the engraftment
and potency of gene-edited HSPC and their progeny. Although our previous findings demonstrate that gene
edited HSPCs engraft long-term in vivo, only a limited proportion persist over time, and are incapable of
supporting antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free virus remission. To address this, we have i) adapted a more
advanced strategy to edit our locus of interest, CCR5, ii) identified an approach to not only disrupt the CCR5
gene, but simultaneously insert therapeutic anti-HIV transgenes, and iii) designed experiments to evaluate this
strategy in our robust nonhuman primate (NHP) model of suppressed HIV infection. We will target two rationally
designed, highly potent anti-HIV transgenes to the gene-edited CCR5 locus: the virus-specific chimeric antigen
receptor CD4CAR, and the broadly neutralizing antibody-like molecule eCD4-Ig. Our preliminary data
demonstrate our ability to insert defined genetic sequences at up to 50% of targeted CCR5 alleles in primary
NHP HSPCs. Here, we will optimize our approach to insert CD4CAR or eCD4-Ig, and safely engraft an
autologous HSPC product containing both CD4CAR∆CCR5 and eCD4-Ig∆CCR5 HSPCs into the same animal.
As we are introducing two therapeutic transgenes and simultaneously disrupting the CCR5 coreceptor, we refer
to this as a “three for one” approach. In addition to generating a potent and efficiently modified HSPC product,
we will work closely with each project in our U19 consortium. We will coordinate with Project 3/Cannon to identify
the most efficient means to modify HSPCs, prior to in vivo studies in our respective animal models. With Project
1/Scadden, we will evaluate a bone marrow cryogel (BMC) scaffold designed to enhance the differentiation of
HSPC-derived T-cells, namely CD4CAR∆CCR5 T-cells. Finally, we will investigate the impact of safer,
nongenotoxic conditioning (NGC) regimens characterized by Project 2/Magenta on infection with simian/human
immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) and suppression by ART. We believe that safe and efficacious engraftment of
gene-modified, virus-specific HSPCs and their progeny will enable robust protection against de novo SHIV
challenge, and significantly impact viral reservoirs in infected, suppressed animals."

Current pharmacologic therapies for TMD pain are largely ineffective and plagued with side effects because their
mechanisms of action to TMD pain have not been validated. Validation of potential pain targets for TMD pain
can facilitate the development of mechanism-based approaches. Emerging evidence suggests that
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)/LPA receptor (LPAR) signaling is a promising target for spinally-mediated
neuropathic pain. However, whether it contributes to trigeminally-mediated TMD pain, which involves
anatomically and functionally unique target tissues and distinct etiology, is not known. In addition, there are
several roadblocks which hamper the translatability of LPA/LPAR to pain therapeutics: 1) this potential pain
target has been rarely validated in human tissues; 2) its mechanisms in pain, particularly where and how it drives
pain, remain poorly understood; and 3) its addiction liability has not been evaluated. The objective of this project
is to identify and validate LPA/LPAR in trigeminal ganglion (TG) sensory neurons as a novel mechanistic target
for the treatment of TMD pain. Our preliminary results revealed that LPA levels in the plasma and TGs are
elevated in mouse models of chronic TMD. In line with results from mice, we also found that LPA in plasma is
increased in TMD patients and, importantly, positively correlated with pain intensity ratings. In addition,
immunostaining analysis showed that LPAR are localized in both mouse and human TG sensory neurons.
Systemic inhibition of LPA/LPAR or local inhibition of LPA/LPAR in TG neurons-innervating TMJ tissues
attenuated mechanical pain and masticatory pain in mouse models of TMD, while they did not show addictive
effects. Moreover, electrophysiological recording revealed LPA/LPAR can sensitize PIEZO2, a mechanical
transducer, in response to mechanical stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesize that LPA/LPAR in TG neurons drive
TMD pain via PIEZO2 ion channel. This central hypothesis will be tested in experiments that seek to: 1)
determine the contribution of elevated LPA to TMD pain; 2) dissect the contribution of LPAR in TG sensory
neurons to LPA-driven TMD pain; and 3) examine whether LPA/LPAR in TG neurons drive TMD pain via PIEZO2
ion channel. The proposed experiments will include rigorous validation using complementary clinically-relevant
animal models, pain measures, human tissues and replication of key experiments across laboratories. We will
also perform extensive experiments evaluating the addiction liability of LPA/LPAR. Success completion of this
project will substantively advance our understanding of TMD pain mechanisms. Importantly, the proposal is
clinically significant because it validates LPA/LPAR as a mechanistic target with exciting potential to prevent
chronic TMD pain."

 Approximately 90% of breast cancer-related deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis of 
tumor cells. While invasive breast cancer incidence rates have been stabilized in white women in the recent 
decade, a steady increase in the incidence rates by 0.3% per year has been observed in black women. 
Meanwhile, the survival rates for invasive breast cancer have increased for both populations over time. 
However, they remain 10% lower for black women. Although the reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, 
differences in molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways driving the progression of the disease might 
account at least in part for the survival disparity. Triple negative breast cancer is more common in black 
women and was shown to exhibit extensive genomic heterogeneity and resistance to drug. In this study, we 
assess cancer cell fusion as a mechanism driving tumor heterogeneity and metastasis and a potential basis for 
the disproportion in breast cancer heterogeneity between white and black women. Different hypotheses have 
been put forward as to how metastasis develops. However, exactly how each of the mechanisms proposed so 
far is accomplished is yet to be established. Studies have suggested that metastatic cells result from the fusion 
of primary tumor cells and cells of hematopoietic lineage. Some reports including ours showed that fusion 
enables rapid diversification and subsequent intra-tumor heterogeneity supportive of metastasis. We observed 
that breast cancer cell fusion happens in vivo and contributes to metastasis. We also showed that fusion 
between non metastatic breast cancer cells and mesenchymal/multipotent stem/stromal cells (MSCs) was 
enhanced with hypoxia by a mechanism involving apoptosis and dependent of the phosphatidyl-serine 
(PtdSer) receptor BAI1. BAI1 and apoptotic cells were recently identified as new promoters of myoblast fusion 
by means of signaling through ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 pathway. The ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 pathway is activated 
in breast cancer. We therefore hypothesize that hypoxia stress-induced apoptosis in primary tumors 
stimulates fusion between tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment by a mechanism involving BAI1 
activation and signals through ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 pathway. Our objective is to investigate the role of 
BAI1/ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 pathway in the mechanism of fusion of breast tumor cells isolated from both white 
and black women with MSCs in vitro. We will also determine the function of BAI1 in breast cancer metastasis 
in vivo by analyzing the ability of breast specific Bai1 knockout mice in the FVB/N-Tg(MMTVPyVT)634Mul/J 
background to develop breast cancer metastasis. The completion of this study would contribute to delineating 
the mechanisms of cancer cell fusion, the role of cancer cell fusion in the development of molecular diversity in 
breast tumors, and potentially the mechanisms of metastases. This study might provide new strategies to 
developing a different class of drugs for breast cancer treatment and/or prevention of metastatic spread. This 
would contribute to the reduction in breast cancer disparities in our communities."

Children with severe neurological impairment (SNI) account for over 50% of deaths in the pediatric intensive
care unit (ICU). Despite making up <1% of the pediatric population, children with SNI make up 25% of ICU
admissions where they experience twice the frequency of mechanical ventilation. During critical illness,
parental stress is high and exacerbated when parents experience stigma related to their child’s neurologic
illness and are unable to share information about their child’s health and family values that guide medical
decision-making with clinicians who have limited time to develop relationships and rotate frequently. The
overall objective of this application is to develop a communication intervention that bolsters parents’ ability to
share their perspectives, needs, and values with clinicians in the ICU. Development of this intervention is
critical to improve clinical care in the ICU for patients with SNI and their families. Following a stepwise
approach for rigorous intervention development, Aim 1 will prospectively examine the longitudinal relationships
between parent perceptions of therapeutic alliance and psychosocial outcomes, including parental stress,
during their child’s ICU admission. Aim 2 will iteratively refine a novel photo-elicitation communication
intervention based on preliminary studies and input from parent-clinician dyads. Aim 3 will pilot test the
intervention among parents of children with SNI and their clinicians in the ICU examining feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. This application will support Dr. Bogetz’ career development as it aligns
closely with additional expertise essential to her success as an independent clinical investigator including
training in: 1) longitudinal cohort studies; 2) psychosocial intervention development; and 3) conducting
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Dr. Bogetz’ career development will be supported by a highly skilled and
successful mentorship and advisory team with expertise in longitudinal cohort studies among seriously ill
children and their parents, photo-elicitation, psychosocial intervention development, and clinical trials. The
environment in which Dr. Bogetz will complete this project is unparalleled, with access to mentoring,
coursework, clinical and office space, research and grants management, and administrative support. This
application is the first to characterize therapeutic alliance and other variables important to the wellbeing of
parents of children with SNI in the ICU and to develop a novel communication intervention tailored to the
unique needs of this population. This application is significant because it aims to relieve stress among a
vulnerable and understudied group of parents whose children disproportionally receive care in the ICU due to
serious illness. At the conclusion of this career development award, Dr. Bogetz will have the training, scalable
intervention, pilot data, and publications to allow her to successfully submit and undertake an R01-level project
testing the hypothesis that the communication intervention will improve psychosocial outcomes among parents
of children with SNI during their child’s critical illness."

Better understanding the interface of depression and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathology could
lead to new strategies to prevent or slow cognitive decline, with significant public health impact.
Depression has historically been neglected and/or excluded in observational cohort and clinical
trial research on AD– so we have limited knowledge about its relationship with pathological
hallmarks of AD and cognitive decline. Our data suggest an association between tau and
depression that may potentiate cognitive decline in preclinical stages of AD—when amyloid are
below PET positivity thresholds--and confer dementia risk. Currently, the model of tau-
associated depressive symptoms needs to be validated across the full spectrum of depressive
symptom severity, including major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study was designed
to address this critical gap. Our overarching goal is to investigate the relationships between tau
and depressive symptoms over time in cognitively unimpaired older adults using both
longitudinal tau PET (with spatiotemporal resolution) and novel plasma tau measures (with
greater potential for clinical translation than PET or CSF) that are gaining rapid readiness for
clinical translation). Achieving this goal will help characterize risk of cognitive decline for older
adults with clinically significant depressive symptoms, optimize approaches to depression
evaluation, and provide potential opportunities for early recognition and prevention of AD. Our
primary hypothesis is that tau in temporal brain regions will predict more severe depressive
symptoms, and that greater depressive symptoms will potentiate tau-associated cognitive
decline. We will test these hypotheses in 150 cognitively unimpaired older adults across the
spectrum of depression (subclinical to Major Depressive Disorder [MDD]) integrating
longitudinal affective and cognitive symptom characterization, tau PET, and tau plasma
biomarker assessments.This is the first study to our knowledge to investigate longitudinal tau
PET and plasma measures in a cohort of older adults across the full range of depressive
symptom severity. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms in
preclinical AD could inform prevention efforts, including tau measurement as a means of
identifying risk in older adults with late life depression. Thus, we will address the FOA goal “to
encourage biomedical, behavioral and social sciences research that will enhance knowledge of
mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or
Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) so as to enable novel treatment development.”"
10845664,"Ten tau immunotherapies are currently in clinical trials. One of the most studied tau epitopes
preclinically, including in our original reports, phospho-serine 396,404, is being targeted in two of these trials.
We have generated several antibodies against it, which have unique binding profiles to these two phospho-
sites and varying efficacy in preventing tau toxicity and promoting tau clearance. It is not clear why the subtle
epitope differences within this region can greatly influence antibody efficacy. Another important issue to
explore is which antibody isotype to choose for clinical trials. To date, these have either strong or limited
effector function with regard to promoting microglial phagocytosis of the tau-antibody complex, but this key
isotype efficacy/safety issue has not been well examined in tauopathy models. The few reports on it differ in
their conclusion. A third matter that needs to be studied further has to do with where to target pathological tau,
intra- and/or extracellularly. Most companies have focused on extracellular clearance but since almost all of
pathological tau resides intracellularly (>99%), targeting it there in addition to extracellularly should be more
efficacious, as we have advocated over the years. Specifically, we have shown that neuronal uptake of tau
antibodies and thereby their efficacy in clearing tau and preventing its toxicity is influenced by their electrical
charge. The relationship between antibody charge and efficacy has been well studied in the cancer field but
has received little attention in the tau field. Finally, it is not clear which forms of tau are most toxic and should
ideally be targeted with therapies. Our recent preliminary data indicates that we have been able to stabilize a
toxic conformation of tau. We would like to clarify this phenomenon, which may have major implications for
understanding tau pathogenesis and for development of therapies. To address these related very important
issues we propose to clarify: 1) the pronounced influence of subtle epitope differences and antibody isotype on
the efficacy of tau antibodies; 2) the robust influence of affinity and electrical charge on antibody efficacy, and;
3) why engineering an effective single domain tau antibody (sdAb) to a full size antibody (Fc-(sdAb)2 renders it
toxic, whereas the same modification for a different effective tau sdAb does not. The scientific premise of these
aims is highly supported by our publications and preliminary data, and the approach is very feasible based on
this foundation and the use of technologies that are well established in our laboratories, reflecting strong rigor
and reproducibility. Together, the outcome of these studies is likely to guide further development of tau
immunotherapies and provide valuable insight into tau pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and related
tauopathies that may be applicable to other targets in various protein aggregation diseases."
10846583,"Drugs are designed to modulate the function of a critical protein involved in a disease; however, almost all small
molecules have off-targets which can mitigate or altogether terminate their therapeutic efficacy. Unfortunately,
there are no general methods that can identify all the protein targets that a drug binds to in an unbiased manner.
For example, Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACIs) show promising clinical activity in many diseases;
however, they are generally of low to moderate specificity and may act in part through, or be hindered by,
uncharacterized off-target interactions. We propose a strategy that will allow for rapid and deep
pharmacological profiling of early drug candidates that 1) identifies protein targets with extraordinary
confidence, 2) localizes the precise site of interaction often with amino acid residue specificity, 3) is robust against
metabolic alterations, 4) distinguishes the pharmacology of metabolites, 5) quantitates differences in
pharmacological activity between cellular contexts. With this approach we will quantitate all interactions that
each inhibitor has with proteins in a living cell. An neutron-encoded ‘bar code’ is added to activity-based
probes during a click capture and release that allows us to blindly trace the drug in a nominal mass independent
manner and simultaneously introduce quantitation channels. The barcodes are revealed in the isotopic fine
structure by high resolution mass spectrometry yet do not compromise sensitivity at lower resolution
fragmentation spectra. The neutron bar code is implemented by moving neutrons between elements and results
in a prescribed pattern of relativistic nuclear mass defects embedded in the framework of a small molecule. With
this method we can confidently retrieve drug-protein reaction products from in vivo systems regardless of
metabolic alterations to the HDAC inhibitors, measure a pharmacological profile and determine molecular
mechanism of action. Our central hypothesis is that neutron encoded activity based probe pharmacological
profiling combined with innovative fragment-based discovery to generate selective HDACIs will enable the
generation of a library of highly characterized and diversely selective HDACI probes. This will be realized through
three specific aims: in aim 1 we will employ a novel and systematically diverse group of sp3-enriched fragments
to generate HDACIs that sample the rim region of HDACs leading to highly selective interactions. In aim 2 we
will measure the pharmacological profile of our novel HDACi’s and their effect on histone acetylation. In aim 3,
we will develop a multiplexed barcoding system which to enable higher detection and resolution of drug targets
over the entire proteome. This overcomes many challenges universal to early stage drug development
efforts that have frustrated the development of specific HDAC inhibitors in particular. Although HDACIs
will be the general focus of this proposal our method is general for drug development in any area."

The proposed program will support five predoctoral trainees per year in an interdisciplinary interdepartmental
training program, previously focused solely on Microbiology and in its 46th year of funding from NIGMS. Based
in the Graduate Programs in Genetics and Molecular Microbiology at the Graduate School of Biomedical
Sciences at Tufts University, trainees will continue to be selected from the strong pool of predoctoral PhD and
MD-PhD students in these programs. Our program will support trainees in their second and third years based
on their commitment to in-depth genetics training as evidenced by their thesis research, and on outstanding
records of academic and research achievement. This expanded program focuses on genetic analysis across
bacteria, viruses, fungi, Drosophila, and higher eukaryotes as a means of understanding fundamental aspects
of cellular growth and differentiation, moving interdisciplinarity to the center of student research. It stresses the
intellectual rigor of the formal genetic approach while insisting that deductions from genetic experiments be
tested at the biochemical-molecular level. Our faculty of 21 are drawn from six different departments and form a
core of exceptional scientists whose hallmark is their commitment to meaningful mentorship. They bring
extended breadth and depth to opportunities for student thesis research across a range of experimental systems
and molecular genetic techniques. In addition to their strong research records, they bring an outstanding track
record of mentoring predoctoral students; 90% of their prior trainees are members of the biomedical workforce.
To strengthen student experience and support across this scientific breadth, we offer a unique multidisciplinary
co-mentorship model that also builds the understanding of collaborative research essential for contemporary
biomedical research and takes advantage of complementary strengths at our Arts, Sciences and Engineering
campus, our School of Veterinary Medicine and our Genetics program at the Jackson Laboratory. Students’
learning is further enhanced through several career development and preparedness activities designed
specifically for this cohort, such as our EDGE program that introduces students to, prepares them for careers in
the biotechnology industry, and launched using a supplement to our current NIGMS T32. These experiences
rely on targeted career advising infrastructure, including an Individual Development Plan, career development
workshops, and industry internships for career exploration. Underlying all our training is our graduate school’s
ongoing mission of training to career excellence through methods and experiences designed to reinforce
research rigor and reproducibility practices, alongside a deep commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
With 12% of PhD graduates in the past 20 years members of underrepresented groups, our program continues
to improve our record of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the biomedical workforce: our commitment
is signaled by a steep rise in the percentage of students from underrepresented groups entering in the past two
academic years (38%)."
10846586,"Project Summary
We propose to study the effects of the chemical composition of the environment on the structure
and function of intrinsically disordered proteins in the test tube and in the cell. The cellular
environment is dynamic and heterogeneous in both space and time, and far removed from the
idealized buffers commonly used in biochemistry experiments. How proteins function in this
environment is a fundamental question in biology that is poorly understood. Especially puzzling
are intrinsically disordered proteins, which make up over 30% of the human proteome and play a
disproportionately large role in cellular regulation and misregulation. Intrinsically disordered
proteins do not adopt a single native structure. Instead, they exist as an ensemble of
conformations that have large surface areas and a low number of intramolecular bonds, making
them highly susceptible to changes in solution composition. Why has evolution selected this
malleable subset of proteins to act as central hubs and regulators of cellular function when routine
cell cycle changes can alter their activity? Our lab aims to understand how disordered proteins
function and interact in the complex cellular environment, and how the chemical composition of
this environment can act as a master regulator that tunes their function. In order to do this, we
use a multi-scale approach that combines all-atom simulations, high-throughput biophysical
methods, and live cell microscopy. This bottom up study is designed to reveal the physical-
chemical rules governing how solution-protein interactions affect protein structure and function.
The broad goals of our work are (1) to gain a molecular-level understanding of how solution
composition controls disordered protein structure and binding in the test tube and inside the cell;
(2) to develop tools to control the chemical composition in the cell, and use this control to alter
protein function; and (3) to identify and characterize the functional mechanisms of proteins that
evolved to act as sensors and actuators of the cellular environment. The proposed work aims to
uncover an entirely new ubiquitous regulation mechanism. Successful completion will uncover the
underlying driving forces behind this solution-driven regulation, identify the proteins affected by it,
and provide researchers with tools to leverage it towards control of cellular pathways. Most
importantly, our findings will be based on physical chemistry principles, and so will not be
organism-specific, and apply to a wide range of biomolecules, organisms, and ecosystems."

It is increasingly clear that ambient and household sources of combustion derived air pollutants threaten healthy
neurodevelopment based on research conducted in high income settings. Advances describe the neurotoxic potential
of traffic-derived emissions, components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and physical
characteristics such as ultrafine particulate (UFP) in experimental models, mechanistic studies, and observational
epidemiological studies of ADHD, autism, and cognitive performance. However, in low resourced settings such as
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where exposure magnitudes are among the highest worldwide, data and capacity are
lacking.
We seek to extend a highly productive 30 plus year University of Washington – University of Nairobi maternal child
health research partnership to incorporate capacity building and research focused on air pollution and child
neurodevelopment in urban Kenya. We leverage a unique pre conception cohort and apply both biomarkers
(urinary PAH metabolites) and mobile monitoring approaches to understand air pollution exposure across the
early life continuum (pregnancy/infancy) as well as describe the impact of sources from ambient and household
origin. Follow up to age 3 years will determine the relationship between early life air pollution exposure and child
motor, cognitive, self-regulation, and executive function skills. The design and engagement reflects 2 pilot
projects awarded in the past year which yielded practical experience and extensive discussions with
environmental scientists and maternal child health experts in Nairobi. The project fills current gaps in child
neurodevelopmental assessments as well as exposure science and laboratory methods to promote maternal
child environmental health research in SSA. The project will advance lab capacity for neurotoxic biomarkers at
two key institutions, will establish innovative methods for ambient air pollution measurement, will develop a
unique pre conception cohort with a biospecimen archive and detailed neurodevelopmental outcome data – each
foundational components of long-term, well-executed studies of air pollution exposure and brain development

high quality, regionally relevant research to program and policy to reduce modifiable environmental risks to
healthy child neurodevelopment."
10846598,"Gallbladder disease is one of the most common digestive disorders, and hallmark properties include
decreased contractility, inflammation, and gallstone formation. Three features are consistently associated with
gallstone disease: (1) elevated cholesterol hydrophobic salt and triglyceride (TG) levels in the bile; (2)
inflammation of the gallbladder; and (3) impairments in gallbladder tone and contractility. Nevertheless, the
interrelationships between decreased gallstone formation, inflammation, and contractility are not understood,
and this reflects our lack of understanding of the cellular events that lead to decreased resting tone and
postprandial contractions in gallbladder disease. This grant application proposes to address these fundamental
gaps in our knowledge. The overall objectives of this grant application are to: (1) elucidate the cellular and
ionic mechanisms by which gallbladder smooth muscle (GBSM) contractility is disrupted in gallstone disease;
(2) determine the role of inflammation in smooth muscle dysfunction and associated biliary stasis in gallstone
disease; and (3) explore the utility of hydrophilic bile salts in the protection of gallbladder function by preventing
or reversing these disruptions to GBSM. We will use wild type and transgenic mice fed a lithogenic (gallstone
forming) diet to evaluate the functional changes that occur in GBSM and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) during
the progression of gallstone disease in normal mice and mice that do not develop gallbladder inflammation.
We will also evaluate GBSM function in mice fed a lithogenic diet while being treated with a cyclooxygenase
inhibitor, or the protective hydrophilic bile salt, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The second model involves
evaluation of the effects of cholesterol and hydrophobic bile salts applied in vitro to gallbladder muscularis
preparations, with or without prior application of UDCA. This approach allows us to examine the actions of
these compounds, individually or together, on GBSM and ICC in a controlled environment.
 This grant proposal involves an integrated approach using state-of-the-art techniques to investigate
gallbladder pathophysiology from single molecules to intact tissue during the progression of disease in the
animal. Techniques to be used include optogenetic Ca2+ imaging of GBSM cells and ICC in intact muscle
bundles, intracellular and patch clamp recording from intact and isolated GBSM cells, respectively, and
muscularis tension measurements. Together with our previous studies on smooth muscle function, we will
provide insights on how gallbladder motor function is disrupted leading to biliary stasis, and the
interrelationship between disrupted motor function and inflammation. Furthermore, these studies will elucidate
the therapeutic potential of UDCA to prevent or reverse cellular changes in GBSM/ICC that underlie decreased
gallbladder contractility, and uncover the cellular mechanisms that mediate their actions in the gallbladder."

Chronic heavy or binge alcohol use is associated with dementia and increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD),
though mechanisms connecting the disease pathologies have not been identified. AD pathology follows a
temporal progression of proinflammatory signaling in brain with Aβ deposition, tau fibril formation, synapse loss,
neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. We find increased AD pathology proteins Aβ1-42 and phosphorylated
(p)-tau-181 in human alcohol use disorder (AUD) brain and after chronic binge ethanol during early life in the 3x-
Tg-AD mouse model. Toll-like Receptor (TLR) proinflammatory signaling is thought to precede gross pathology
in AD, and is a prominent feature of AUD. We find AUD in young individuals is associated with AD protein
accumulation, and chronic binge ethanol treatment in 3x-Tg-AD mice causes persistent upregulation of
proinflammatory genes that correlated strongly with levels of neurotoxic Aβ1-42 and p-tau-181 protein. Thus, we
hypothesize ethanol promotes AD neurotoxic protein pathology by enhancing proinflammatory signaling.
Microglia have emerged as mediators of AD pathology, contributing to Aβ plaque formation, tau propagation,
synapse loss and possibly neurodegeneration. Microglial change phenotype (e.g. resting, phagocytic,
proinflammatory, pruning, or neurotoxic) and microglial activation is thought to precede and promote AD
pathology. Human GWAS as well as human and AD mouse single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have
identified AD microglia as altered, having increased C1q (pro-synaptic pruning) and reduced resting state
markers (e.g. Tmem119). In human AUD brain, we find reduced resting state microglia (reduced Tmem119)
with proinflammatory microglia. Further, we find chronic binge ethanol in vivo persistently increases C1q and
proinflammatory cytokines mirroring AD. Thus, we hypothesize proinflammatory microglial activation by
chronic heavy/binge ethanol promotes AD Aβ and tau pathology, synapse loss and neurodegeneration.
This hypothesis will be tested in human AD post-mortem brain (Aim 1), and the 3x-Tg-AD mouse model (Aim 2)
that features progressive Aβ and tau pathology.
Apoptotic neuronal cell death is a feature of AD pathology thought to contribute to irreversible cognitive decline.
We find binge ethanol increases neurodegeneration in brain regions known to have neuronal loss in AD such as
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Our studies implicate proinflammatory Toll-like Receptor (TLR)
activation and microglial to neuronal interactions that lead to apoptotic neuronal cell death. We find chronic
binge ethanol increases HMGB1-TLR4 signaling to activate microglia. Proinflammatory microglia secrete the
miRNA let-7b that we found activates TLR7 in neurons. Let-7b-TLR7 signaling in neurons induces apoptotic
neuronal cell death via the TNF-receptor superfamily apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). TLR4, HMGB1, let-7
and TRAIL have each been implicated in AD pathology. However, a link in AD neurodegeneration has not been
identified. We hypothesize chronic binge ethanol promotes AD neurodegeneration by enhancing TRAIL-
mediated apoptotic neuronal cell death. This hypothesis will be tested in human AD post-mortem brain (Aim
1), and the 5xFAD AD mouse model (Aim 3) that features Aβ-induced apoptotic neuronal death."
10846684,"Mechanistic studies pertaining to sex-based differences in metabolic syndrome (MetS) are currently insufficient
to explain and prevent the higher prevalence of certain MetS symptoms in women versus men and
higher prevalence of other symptoms such as hyperlipidemia in men versus women. MetS describes a
constellation of risk factors, such as abdominal adiposity, hypertension, glucose intolerance/hyperglycemia,
and dyslipidemia, leading to diabetes and cardiovascular morbidity. High-caloric intake and sedentary lifestyle
habits are among key players shown to induce symptoms of MetS. However, exposures to environmental
chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), often dictated by socio-economic status and
education levels, have been increasingly identified as additional key players leading to MetS consequences.
Previous studies showed that exposures to POPs, such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in in-vivo models and human studies were associated with diabetes, obesity
and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which are hallmarks for MetS development. Furthermore, using in-
vitro models and diet-induced obesity mouse models, we had previously demonstrated that the liver was
the predominant target organ of toxicity to POPs, including PCBs, and mechanism(s) of toxicity were
primarily through activation of hepatic receptors leading to metabolic disruption. The liver has long been
established as a sexually dimorphic organ and it is therefore important to address POPs toxicity in term of
biological differences or sex. Additionally, POPs such as OCPs are endocrine disrupting chemicals, having the
ability to interact with androgen or estrogen receptors, and potentially promoting variable effects in men and
women. However, most epidemiologic studies demonstrating associations between POPs exposure with liver
toxicity/metabolic diseases including diabetes either focused on agricultural workers who were mostly men or
adjusted for sex; but POPs exposures occur in both men and women and thus their health risks may vary.
POPs exposures today is primarily through ingestion of contaminated food and water, and serum levels can
vary depending on sex and gender. Hence, it is relevant to examine exposures to POPs such as OCPs based
on ‘environment-sex-gene’ interactions to better address such discrepancies."

Through experienced leadership and continuous strategic investment, Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) has
spearheaded cancer-focused educational and professional development activities across the Medical
University of South Carolina (MUSC) for more than three decades. Inherent to its core mission, HCC offers an
innovative portfolio of training activities and career enhancement programs to maximize cancer-focused career
success and advance a diverse cancer research workforce. Buoyed by significant accomplishments, HCC
leadership renewed ongoing programs and expanded its cancer research career enhancement activities during
the current project period. These accomplishments include multiple HCC-driven initiatives and awards, such as
a renewed postdoctoral T32 for Integrative Training in Oncogenic Signaling (T32CA193201), HCC-funded
Postdoctoral and Graduate Fellowship programs, the SC Cancer Health Equity Research Consortium
(R25CA193088) summer undergraduate education award, SC Cancer Disparities Research Center
(CA210962), which includes an education and training core, and HCC-funded Clinical Scholars Program. As a
result, peer-reviewed funding has increased by 41% since the last renewal. Training at HCC spans the
education spectrum, from high school trainees to early-stage investigators, including continuing education for
healthcare professionals in the community. Cancer research training is cohesively integrated with an annual
cancer research symposium celebrating excellence across training disciplines and stages. What characterizes
HCC’s educational and training enterprise is its significant record of accomplishment in providing SC’s only
comprehensive, cancer-focused research education and training opportunities, the intentional inclusion of
cancer disparities education in its programs, and strong partnerships among key minority-serving institutions.
In the next funding cycle, the Associate Director of Education and Training, Benjamin Toll, PhD (CC), with
guidance from an internal Education and Training Leadership Council, HCC Executive Council, and HCC’s
External Scientific Advisory Board, is crafting several new initiatives that will create programs for the center’s
education and training pipeline and novel trainings for healthcare professionals to enhance trainee tracking and
evaluation system, and augment mentoring programs. New directions involve synergistic approaches with Plan
to Enhance Divesrity and Community Outreach and Engagement to launch the Developing Leaders Program
and a retention committee entitled Faculty Engagement and Advancement Team to foster critical faculty
engagement and execute more targeted approaches for recruiting and supporting individuals that have been
historically underrepresented in biomedical and cancer research. These initiatives will help retain and develop
a pipeline for future HCC leaders, expand collaborative cancer-oriented education and training programs with
Historically Black College & University partners, and establish a broad array of new mentoring initiatives and
integration of CRTEC with the new Office of Programs to Enhance Diversity."
10847766,"PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY (PED): SUMMARY
A diverse and inclusive workforce is critical for cancer centers to promote equity and eliminate cancer
disparities. Unfortunately, certain populations, including women and some racial/ethnic groups, continue to be
underrepresented in cancer research and care. The mission of the Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Plan to
Enhance Diversity (PED) is to build a workforce that reflects the diversity of our nation and is equipped to serve
the state of South Carolina (SC). At HCC, the Office of Programs to Enhance Diversity (OPED) is led by
Nicholas Shungu, MD, MPH (CC), Associate Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Shungu is a
primary care clinician, cancer disparities researcher, and advocate for health equity with DEI leadership
experience at the Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine. Shungu chairs the HCC DEI
Committee (DEIC), which develops and oversees HCC programs to recruit and retain a diverse workforce.
OPED will maintain the infrastructure of pathway programs to support the advancement of underrepresented in
the scientific workforce (URSW) populations into cancer research and care positions. Starting with robust
partnerships with local high schools and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in SC, the
pathways span from engaging high school learners to preparing mid-career faculty for leadership positions.
Recruiting and retaining URSW individuals requires continuously evaluating and improving a culture of
inclusivity. OPED will conduct an annual climate survey whose results will guide further recruitment and
training initiatives. In alignment with the HCC strategic aim to recruit, train, and develop a cancer workforce
that reflects the diversity of the communities HCC serves, OPED directs education efforts for individuals at all
stages of the training continuum to promote the inclusion of all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender,
gender identity, sexual orientation, language, and ability. OPED works collaboratively with the MUSC
Department of DEI, including shared resources for the mentorship of URSW individuals and opportunities for
leadership and inclusivity training. OPED will oversee a novel mentorship program for URSW trainees and
faculty, the development of required HCC DEI modules for new hires, support of URSW individuals for internal
and external professional development opportunities, nominations to diversify advisory boards, and new
recruitment initiatives targeting staff, trainees, and faculty. The HCC is proud to have an Associate Director
Leadership Council that is 33% Black/African American, which will help ensure that DEI initiatives are
integrated throughout all HCC operations. HCC also takes pride in its highly successful partnership with SC
State University, an HBCU, and the resultant development of the U54 SC Disparities Research Center. By
supporting infrastructure for the recruitment and retention of URSW individuals at all levels of training, the PED
core, in collaboration with research, clinical, community engagement, and educational programs, enhances the
ability of HCC to cultivate a culturally sensitive and diverse workforce that optimally serves the state of SC."
10847572,"SUMMARY: ANIMAL CORE (CORE D)
Investigations into brain tumor biology and therapy are best carried out in orthotopic animal models that mimic
the natural milieu of the tumor. The ability to reach meaningful conclusions from these in vivo studies is greatly
enhanced when uniform, readily reproducible animal models are used. The purpose of the Brain SPORE Animal
Core is to provide centralized and specialized animal modeling, thereby achieving uniformity and reproducibility
that enables accurate comparisons between experiments, research groups, and projects in this Brain Cancer
SPORE. To this end, the Core will:
1) Support specialized surgical methods to generate brain tumor models. A key component of many Brain
 SPORE studies is the intracranial mouse tumor model. Core D provides surgical expertise in guide screw
 placement and intracranial tumor implantation, as well as other specialized surgical techniques.
2) Support all animal strains and tumor cell lines. This includes immunocompromised mice and humanized
 mice for human glioma xenografts, immune competent mouse strains for murine xenografts, and
 genetically engineered mouse models. In addition to mouse and human glioma cell lines, Core D has over
 40 patient derived glioma stem-like cell lines representing all glioma subtypes that are fully characterized
 with respect to gene expression, mutation profiles, and in vivo growth characteristics.
3) Support specialized treatment delivery methods. Core D can support complex drug delivery regimens
 including intracranial injection, intra-thecal injections, intravenous and intra-arterial injections, and oral
gavage.
4) Support in vivo imaging and sample collection to assess therapeutic efficacy. Core D supports tumor
 bioluminescence imaging and MRI and will assist with tissue and blood collection.
The combined expertise of the Animal Core personnel lends itself to productive collaboration with SPORE and
non-SPORE investigators in developing new animal models and unique surgical methods for therapeutic delivery
and data collection. These services are mission critical and one or more of these services are used by all Projects
in this application."
10847357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The evolutionarily-conserved Wnt signal transduction pathway directs cell proliferation and differentiation
during animal development and tissue homeostasis. Despite the fact that deregulation of Wnt signaling
underlies numerous developmental disorders and cancers, including nearly all colorectal cancers, many of
these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that activate
this pathway will guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat Wnt-driven diseases. The
long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to elucidate the mechanisms that activate Wnt signaling during
animal development and to use this knowledge to identify control points in the pathway susceptible to
therapeutic targeting in Wnt-driven diseases. In support of this effort, the PI and her laboratory group have
established innovative in vivo models in Drosophila that have revealed unanticipated functions of three core
Wnt pathway effectors: the tumor suppressor, APC; the scaffold protein, Axin; and the ADP-ribose polymerase,
Tankyrase. Building on these findings and enabled by genome-wide screens designed to uncover new Wnt
signaling regulators, the current project will address three major unsolved questions: 1) how the membrane-
associated receptor activation complex is assembled and activated; 2) how the negative regulatory cytosolic
beta-catenin destruction complex is inhibited upon Wnt stimulation; and 3) how the nuclear beta-catenin-TCF
transcription complex is activated. To elucidate the role of previously unknown Wnt pathway activators, this
project will couple genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches with in vivo assays previously
developed by the PI to monitor pathway activation within Wnt signaling gradients. It will apply an innovative
focus centered on three components: a deubiquitinating complex essential for Wnt receptor stability, a ubiquitin
ligase essential for signaling activation, and a kinase that activates the beta-catenin-TCF transcription
complex. This work is complemented by productive collaborations with investigators who have expertise in the
biochemical reconstitution of Wnt signaling, Wnt pathway analysis in vertebrate models, and in the
identification of Wnt-dependent post-translational protein modifications using mass spectrometry analysis. The
successful completion of this work will provide an understanding of: 1) the control of Wnt receptor activity; 2)
the control of the beta-catenin destruction complex; 3) the activation of the Wnt transcription complex; and 4)
novel therapeutic strategies to target Wnt-driven diseases."
10848315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the Pilot and Feasibility Program of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to promote
digestive disease research by supporting innovative pilot projects that will lead to extramurally funded research
and expansion of digestive disease research. The Program pursues this goal with three complementary aims:
1) To foster the career development of junior digestive disease investigators, 2) To encourage established
investigators in other areas of biomedical research to extend their expertise to digestive disease research, and
3) To support highly focused new projects from established investigators exploring innovative new ideas that
represent a significant departure from their funded research. The organization of the P/F Program aligns types
of investigators with these aims (“N=New,” “EN=Established New,” and ”E=Established”, respectively)
according to well-established eligibility criteria. The DHC holds one P/F application process yearly, which
undergoes scientific review by a panel of experts using the same merit criteria as NIH study sections, followed
by a final review by the DHC External Advisory Board, who makes recommendation for funding of most
meritorious research projects. With strong institutional support that supplements the DHC resources, the
Program typically funds three awards of $50,000. The Program Director and Center Leadership provide
awardees with mentorship opportunities. This program has been very successful, and Type N awardees
transitioned to independent investigator status with R01-level of funding. For the past 10 years, the Program
invested approximately $1.58 million, which resulted >$35.17 million dollars in new grants, or a >22-fold return
on the investment. Notably, P/F awardees have published 228 original papers and >90% remain engaged in
digestive disease research."
10848396,"The research objective of this multidisciplinary proposal is to examine the neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and biochemical consequences of excessive and deficient folic acid supplementation in a preclinical model. In this context vitamin B12 deficiency, a micronutrient required for the folate cycle, will also be tested. Central to our investigation are structural defects of the cerebral cortex, the predominant site of maldevelopment in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including neuronal migration disorders, childhood epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In these conditions, changes in prenatal neurogenesis can be the principal cause of structural abnormalities, such as pathological brain size variation, cortical lamination defects, or defective cytoarchitectural integrity. Consequently, further investigating the genetic and environmental causes and consequences of dysregulated early neurogenesis is of key importance towards a better understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders and the conception of preventive strategies. In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration mandated the fortification of grain products with folic acid to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects, which in combination with rising supplementation has led to a substantial increase in folic acid intake in the US. Intriguingly, our preliminary work has confirmed that excess maternal folic acid intake can alter cortical developmental neurogenesis. The question that arises from these observations is can too much of a good thing be a bad thing? Could excess folic acid intake during pregnancy result in altered cortical neurogenesis causing cerebral structural defects with life-long consequences. This concept has obtained further relevance by recent reports from epidemiological studies that found a higher incidence of ASD cases born to mothers with highest folate levels in their blood. To comprehensively explore this question, we will administer folic acid under three different conditions, a reduced folate in excess, and both in combination with B12 deficiency to pregnant dams to create test groups of offspring that we will analyze with respect to neurodevelopmental outcomes and behavioral abnormalities associated with social, cognitive, and anxiety disorders. These studies will be accompanied by detailed biochemical investigations on brain folate pathway dysregulations, including folate transport, processing, and consequences for DNA methylation."
10848399,"Project Summary
Recovery after ischemic stroke is one of the most critical rehabilitative medical problems in
medicine. While current treatments are effective in removing clots, most patients do not present to hospitals
before serious tissue damage occurs in the brain, with as many as two-thirds of stroke survivors
requiring neurorehabilitation. Furthermore, post-stroke outcomes have been poorly studied in patients
with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is a form of cerebrovascular disease and is characterized by
substantial beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation within cerebral vasculature, including the blood-brain barrier
(BBB). This condition exceeds amyloid deposits associated with normal aging and may contribute to age-related
neurological decline. Additionally, Aβ accumulation in CAA is a risk factor for ischemic infarcts and degradation
of vessel wall architecture. The integrity of vessel wall architecture is crucial for post-stroke tissue recovery since
many proliferative neural progenitor cells (NPC) are close to and communicating with cerebral vasculature (BBB).
This pool of proliferative NPCs that can become depleted by stroke can be mutually affected by Aβ accumulation,
leading to delayed recovery of both motor and cognitive functions. We aim to understand the mechanism behind
delayed post-stroke recovery because of both conditions so that targeted therapies can be proposed in the
future.
To study this, we will employ a transgenic 5xFAD mouse model that recapitulates Aβ accumulation in the brain
to analyze CAA and cerebrovascular ischemia. The central hypothesis of this study is that Aβ accumulation in
cerebral vasculature exacerbates ischemic stroke outcomes and delays post-stroke recovery by inducing BBB
dysfunction and aberrant neurogenesis of NPCs. Experiments will focus on neurogenesis post-stroke, as well
as microvascular function and the bioenergetic mechanisms that induce it. While there is no effective strategy to
treat tissue damage following ischemic stroke and/or treat Aβ accumulation in the brain, this project focuses
on the mechanism of CAA-related stroke in order to develop therapeutic strategies in the future. Defining
neuropathogenesis of both CAA and ischemic stroke incidents is of significant relevance in translational medicine
and clinical practice because most patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) also present with
CAA; therefore, most of the disease burden due to CAA can be clinically relevant to treatments that also affect
AD."
10848502,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype strongly impacts several major pathological features of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits, intracellular tau
tangle formation, and microglial dysfunction. The metabolism and signaling of ApoE in the brain
are controlled by members of the lipoprotein receptor superfamily, and genetic manipulation of
ApoE receptors has been shown to significantly impact AD pathology. Hence, the pathways
modulating ApoE receptors in the brain represent promising targets for the therapeutic
intervention in AD.
 Previously, we have identified the inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, is a major post-translational regulator of three ApoE receptors: low-density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and ApoE Receptor 2
(ApoER2). Each of these ApoE receptor plays key role in modulating ApoE actions and
impacting AD pathogenesis in the brain. We showed that both genetic deletion and therapeutic
reduction of IDOL increases brain ApoE receptors levels, decreases Aβ levels, and improves
cognitive functions in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis. Our recent mechanistic research
revealed IDOL knockdown markedly increases microglial phagocytosis of fibrillar Aβ in vivo, and
the subpopulation of disease-associated microglia (DAM), a phagocytic microglia population
associated with Aβ plaques. Our research also suggests that LDLR, an IDOL substrate, plays
an important role in facilitating metabolic reprogramming of microglia during phagocytosis likely
by mediating the uptake of ApoE lipoproteins. Furthermore, IDOL regulates the expression of
ApoER2, a receptor that is enriched in the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses.
ApoER2-mediated signaling is known to increase glutamatergic neurotransmission and
antagonize Aβ-induced suppression of synaptic functions. We showed that manipulation of
IDOL expression in neuron is sufficient to modulate synaptic transmission. Based on these
results, our goals of this proposal are to delineate molecular mechanisms by which IDOL-ApoE
receptor pathway modulates ApoE actions and impacts Aβ pathology. Aim 1 is to define the role
of IDOL in facilitating microglial response to Aβ and impacting the progression of Aβ pathology.
Aim 2 is to elucidate the mechanisms of how IDOL-LDLR axis facilitates metabolic
reprogramming and ApoE signaling in microglia. Aim 3 is to delineate the role of neuronal IDOL
in enhancing ApoER2-mediated signaling and protecting against Aβ-induced synaptic
dysfunction and cognitive deficit."
10848504,"Developmental stuttering commonly emerges between 24-60 months of age with the majority of these children
recovering from stuttering. For the remaining children, persistent stuttering into school-age years and
adulthood confers significant risk for adverse impact on social-emotional, educational, and vocational
outcomes. Although over the past years a variety of risk factors for stuttering persistence have been identified
(e.g., stuttering severity, sex, age at onset, time since onset, articulation, language ability), there is still a critical
need to optimize the accuracy with which stuttering persistence can be predicted. To date, predictive models
have rarely considered the role of emotion; however, our preliminary data suggest that it plays a major role in
stuttering persistence. Specifically, our cross-sectional work has demonstrated that cortical and autonomic
markers of emotional reactivity and emotion-related cognitive control vulnerabilities in children who stutter
(CWS) contribute to stuttering and are associated with persistence (pilot data). We recently extended this work
and developed a novel methodology to test the effects of emotional reactivity on speech preparation and
production in young children at risk for persistence. Based on our findings to date, the central hypothesis of the
proposed project is that emotional reactivity plays a major role in stuttering persistence by interfering
with both non-speech cognitive control (e.g. inhibition and execution) and speech preparation and
production processes necessary for the early development of speech fluency and thereby confers
heightened risk for stuttering persistence. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a longitudinal study of
young (3- to 4-year old) CWS. Annual lab visits will occur for 3 years from study enrollment and will involve a
comprehensive stuttering assessment, a speech-language, cognitive, and temperament diagnostic battery as
well as the systematic assessment of emotional reactivity, cognitive control, and speech preparation and
production processes. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) determine if cortical and autonomic
biomarkers of emotional reactivity predict outcome (persist versus recover) for CWS, (2) determine if emotion-
related performance during a non-speech cognitive control task and a speaking task predicts outcome (persist
versus recover) for CWS, and (3) determine whether markers of emotional contributions to stuttering provide
additive predictive value when combined with other established variables associated with stuttering
persistence. If successful, the proposed project addresses the continued clinical need to identify markers of
risk for stuttering persistence and improve the accuracy of predictive models. These advances will allow
clinicians to better pinpoint targets for assessment, set the stage for novel therapeutic approaches, and allow
researchers to better evaluate the effects of early intervention due to an improved ability to distinguish
persistent from transient cases. Thus, the proposed research supports the mission of NIDCD by discovering
new knowledge that has the potential to improve outcomes of young children who stutter."

10849020,"MASS SPECTROMETRY & ANALYTICAL PHARMACOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT
SUMMARY
In 2021, the Proteomics & Metabolomics Shared Resource (PMSR), which had been Cancer Center Support Grant
(CCSG)–funded since 2009, was reorganized to form the Mass Spectrometry & Analytical Pharmacology Shared
Resource (MSAPSR) with the inclusion of new mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), pharmacokinetic (PK), and
pharmacodynamics (PD) capabilities at the NJ site. The MSAPSR functions under a collaborative model
organized into four essential components: (1) proteomics, (2) metabolomics, (3) molecular imaging, and (4)
PK/PD applications. The creation of MSAPSR affords Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center
(LCCC) Members seamless access to cutting-edge technical expertise, services, and technologies across the
consortium. MSAPSR is co-directed by Claire Carter, PhD (NJ), Junfeng Ma, PhD (DC) and Amrita Cheema,
PhD (DC), and is supported by five staff members and two faculty members with expertise in sample preparation,
experimental design, data acquisition and data analysis. Supported by $6.9M in institutional investment since
2019, MSAPSR houses multiple state-of-the-art instruments across both campuses to provide: (1) routine and
advanced MS -based proteomic studies for the identification of proteins and peptides, and the characterization
of post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, O-GlcNAcylation) and quantification (iTRAQ);
(2) multiplex and spatial imaging of protein markers at the subcellular level using imaging mass cytometry (IMC)
for cancer cells and immune cells in tissue sections; (3) comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic profiling and
quantitation, through the utilization of over a dozen in-house developed and validated MS-based assays; (4)
real-time cellular metabolic flux and respiration analysis using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer; (5) MSI
to allow untargeted label-free imaging of lipids, metabolites, glycans, peptides and pharmaceuticals within tissue
sections and 3D organoid/spheroid models; and (6) support for drug development pipelines through MS-based
PK and PD investigations. The MSAPSR receives input from the Advisory Committee and annual user surveys
to prioritize development and assess programmatic needs across the Consortium. To this end, the individual
components of the MSAPSR augment basic, clinical, translational, and population science cancer research by
providing access to the expertise and instrumentation for a wide spectrum of MS- based molecular phenotyping
services. Taken together, these components support systems biology understanding of the interplay between
pathways that drive cancer development, aggression, metastatic disease, resistance to therapy and therapeutic
efficacy. In FY2022, the MSAPSR provided services to 28 LCCC Members across all three LCCC Research
Programs (10 Cancer Cell Biology Members, 16 Cancer Host Interactions Members, and 2 Cancer Prevention
and Control Members). During the current project period, the MSAPSR enabled the success of 31 peer-reviewed
cancer-relevant extramural grants, 3 clinical trials and 54 peer-reviewed publications, including 10 publications
in high-impact (IF >10) journals."
10861066,"Project Summary: Feeding and drinking are essential behaviors for the maintenance of energy and
fluid homeostasis. Failure to maintain energy balance causes obesity or malnutrition and
perturbations in fluid balance cause dehydration or hypertension. The neural circuits that control
hunger and thirst have been well studied but overlapping neural pathways in the control of hunger or
of thirst, and the strong interdependence of feeding and drinking has made it difficult to untangle the
respective circuits. To address this long-standing problem, this project takes a novel approach that
uses the Brattleboro rat to tease apart aspects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) system that
control feeding and drinking. The Brattleboro rat is a well-studied rodent model of central diabetes
insipidus that originated in a colony of Long Evans rats. A naturally occurring single nucleotide
mutation in these rats results in a vasopressin precursor that cannot be secreted, causing severe
polyuria. To compensate for the polyuria, Brattleboro rats drink approximately five times that
consumed by wild-type littermates, without any observed feeding-related phenotype. A series of
studies in our laboratory suggest that at least part of the polydipsia involves disrupted satiety signals.
Specifically, licking microstructure analyses revealed differences that are consistent with altered
satiation and additional studies suggest that Brattleboro rats have altered fluid intake-relevant GLP-1
signaling, but intact feeding-related GLP-1 responses. Moreover, Brattleboro rats appear to have
different GLP-1 precursor expression in the hindbrain when compared with that of wild type
littermates. Taking advantage of these differences in fluid intake, in the absence of differences in food
intake, this project uses a variety of approaches to better elucidate circuits responsible for the control
of drinking, especially relevant for satiation of thirst, and to separate these from circuits responsible
for food intake. Accordingly, by testing for differences between wild-type and Brattleboro rats, we can
identify circuits and populations of cells in the GLP-1 system that control drinking and separate them
from those that control other functions such as feeding. As such, these data will lead to a more
complete understanding of the circuits that control fluid and food intake satiety and provide targets for
treatments of disordered energy and fluid homeostasis."
10861068,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the last several decades it has become apparent that carbon monoxide (CO) gas is an important small
molecule that greatly impacts human health. Indeed, CO is created endogenously in small concentrations and
has been shown to be an essential signaling molecule in the human neuronal system. Moreover, CO gas has
been revealed to be a valuable therapeutic, specifically, it can ameliorate acute and chronic inflammation, can
reduce rejection of organ transplants, and can treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the direct study or use
of CO in biological systems is inherently complex because it is a gas, has limited solubility in water, and is toxic
at high concentrations. As such, many of the mechanisms and pathways by which CO operates in the human
body remain elusive. In response to these complications, CO Releasing Molecules (CORMs) have emerged as
a class of materials that can release CO in response to an external stimulus. As transition metals readily ligate
to and release CO under various conditions, these materials were the first class of CORMs developed and remain
the most popular and frequently utilized to date. Unfortunately, CORMs based on transition metal carbonyl
complexes are cytotoxic, form poorly defined products following release of CO, and cannot be directly
polymerized to form macromolecular targeted therapeutics. Research in the Worrell laboratory is inspired by the
shortcomings in current CORM technology, and we are actively engaged in creating stable, modular, and efficient
organic CO releasing molecules. Our work has been concentrated on analogs of diphenylcyclopropenone
(DPCP), a uniquely stable and bio-orthogonal molecule that features a highly strained 3 membered ring. Previous
work in a small molecule setting has shown that DPCP is unrivaled in its ability to cleanly and efficiently produce
CO gas. Proof-of-concept demonstrations have shown that analogs of DPCP can be effectively synthesized, can
be directly polymerized, and can release CO gas by photolysis, however, for application as a CORM, this must
be demonstrated in a biological system. Future work over the five-year course of this program will concentrate
on the development of methods for the controlled polymerization of DPCP to create tailored macromolecular
materials that are soluble, targeted, non-toxic, and biocompatible. We will further concentrate on improving the
rate and efficacy of CO release by leveraging the unique photophysics of DPCPs while creating well-defined
photoproducts. Ultimately, the most impactful extension of this work will be related to its development in studying
and treating gastrointestinal inflammation as part of a long-term collaboration with the Colgan/Onyiah group at
the University of Colorado Medical School. Although there are significant challenges associated with this
program, its scientific impacts will be far-reaching. If successful, organic CORMs will supersede those based on
transition metal complexes, stimulating the development of new targeted therapeutics based on the production
of CO gas."
10861073,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Disease severity is highly variable, even among families with the same PKD gene mutation. This variability has been attributed, in part, to environmental factors. Among them, a high protein diet is one of the most recognized ADPKD progression-accelerating factor. Protein composition is also a key element that can affect the rate of cyst growth. For example, soy protein compared to casein (animal-based protein) diet slows kidney cyst in rodent PKD models. Our preclinical data shows that wheat gluten (WG) diet compared to casein protein diet decreased the number of kidney macrophages (MФ), expression of Ccl2 (but not Csf1 or Ccl5) and slowed the rate of cyst growth in Pkd1-knockout mice. Therefore, animal-based protein load may have cystogenesis-promoting effects through augmentation of the cystogenesis-promoting Ccl2 pathway. Previous studies show that loss of Pkd1 increases Ccl2 in the renal tubules facilitating the recruitment of MФ, promoting kidney cyst growth and that these effects were attenuated in Ccl2-Pkd1 double knockout mice. We found that animal protein load impairs kidney mitochondrial function in Pkd1-knockout mice. When these mice were fed a WG diet enriched with top 3 amino acids abundant in casein compared to WG diet, there was increased number of kidney MФ and cyst growth compared to counterparts fed an isocaloric WG diet. This suggest that specific AAs in the casein diet promotes cyst growth. Furthermore, treatment with lysine (most abundant AA in casein compared to WG diet), but not aspartate (second abundant in casein) or glutamate (most abundant in WG), suppressed markers of mitochondrial function, impaired glucose metabolism, increased gluconeogenesis marker phosphoenolpyruvate (Pepck1) and increased tubular injury in Pkd1 mouse kidney cells. Oral lysine supplementation (1wk) in Pkd1 knockout mouse increased kidney cyst growth and levels of Pepck1 compared to counterparts given a saline. These data are well aligned with a major role kidneys play in AA metabolism through the mitochondria, an organelle that is functionally impaired by PKD mutations. Our overarching hypothesis is that specific AA(s) abundant in an animal protein-based diet exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, increase chemokine expression, MФ recruitment, and accelerate cystogenesis. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that high casein-protein diet impairs mitochondrial function, activates chemokine Ccl2 expression, increases kidney MФ accumulation, and promotes cyst growth; and deletion of Ccl2 in Pkd1-knockout mice have opposite effects. Aim2 will test the hypothesis that specific AA (lysine) abundant in an animal-based protein diet compared to a plant-based diet, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased immune response and accelerated cyst growth. The clinical significance of this grant proposal is that patients with PKD could benefit from a plant-based protein diet and recent plant-based meat development has made dietary protein modification a feasible intervention that is safe and can have immediate impact for patients with ADPKD that require long-term treatment."
10861075,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objectives of this K01 award are twofold: (1) to enable the candidate to obtain the additional training
required for an independent research career investigating self-regulatory pathways of risk for adolescent
externalizing problems and substance use, with a focus on early life environmental exposures; and (2) to
leverage the infrastructure from an existing parent study of smoke exposure during pregnancy and the
immediate postpartum period to conduct baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-ups of the sample (currently ages
10-13 years old) and advance knowledge of self-regulatory pathways linking early smoke exposure to offspring
substance use, ADHD symptoms, and conduct problems. Due to the high prevalence and fiscal and societal
consequences of early life smoke exposure, understanding the pathways linking smoke exposure to offspring
externalizing problems and substance use may attenuate a major public health concern. Therefore, the aims of
this project are to: examine the effects of early smoke exposure on adolescent self-regulation, substance use
and externalizing (ADHD symptoms, conduct problems; aim 1); explore links between self-regulation at the
K01 study baseline and substance use and externalizing at 6- and 12-month follow-ups (aim 2a); and identify
self-regulation problems at the K01 study baseline that mediate early smoke exposure and level of, and
change in substance use and externalizing severity over time (aim 2b). This project will extend the study of a
unique sample to characterize the neurobehavioral effects of early smoke exposure as children transition to
adolescence, a developmental period that is vital for the development of self-regulation, as well as increased
risk for substance use and externalizing behavior. This research will identify self-regulation outcomes most
influenced by early smoke exposure and their relations to externalizing problems and substance use. Self-
regulation is malleable and self-regulation interventions improve substance use and externalizing behavior.
Therefore, findings from this study may help to identify children at greatest risk for future externalizing and
substance use problems and determine potential avenues for intervention, which may reduce the public health
impact of these problems. This K01 award will also allow the candidate the time and training required to build
on her existing strengths and facilitate her transition to an independent scientist. To pursue this long-term
research agenda, the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies-based candidate will work
with experienced mentors to achieve the following training goals: (1) Obtain expertise in measuring and
evaluating the effects of early smoke exposure; (2) Develop expertise in research design and methodology to
comprehensively assess adolescent self-regulation; (3) Develop expertise in the assessment of adolescent
substance use and externalizing (ADHD symptoms, conduct problems); and (4) Learn to apply advanced
statistical methods for analyzing developmental data. This K01 addresses a NIDA priority to characterize
developmental factors that mediate risk and resilience for drug use and addiction."
10861080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) cause alterations to the vasculature, disrupting the neurovascular unit
(NVU) and causing neuroinflammation and neuronal death. In response to vascular damage, glial cells of the
central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes and microglia, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that can contribute
to neuronal death. However, the specific signaling that connects the damaged neurovasculature to the glial
response after injury remains to be understood. The eye, as CNS tissue, allow us to study the interactions
between the vasculature and glial cells. Similar to human pathology, Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) in mice
causes retinal edema, inflammation, and neuronal death; providing a model to study these interactions. Using
this model, previous studies in our lab identified non-apoptotic activation of the protease caspase-9, that is
usually associated with cell death, in the endothelium. Inhibiting caspase-9 or genetically deleting it from the
endothelium, protects the retina from edema and neuronal death. These results indicated that expression of
endothelial caspase-9 (EC Casp9) leads to neurodegeneration after vascular injury. Furthermore, we discovered
that inhibiting caspase-9 significantly reduces the activity of caspase-6 (executioner caspase that can be
activated by caspase-9) in astrocytes, but not microglia. Activation of caspase-6 in astrocytes is associated with
increased cleavage and hyper-aggregation of GFAP and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. I hypothesize
that non-apoptotic activation of EC Casp9 increases astroglial caspase-6 which will result in the cleavage of
GFAP, production of inflammatory cytokines, and neurodegeneration P-RVO. The long-term objective of this
proposal is to study the role of caspase-9 signaling in vascular-glial communication and its contribution to
increased pro-inflammatory cytokine and neurodegeneration. Studies in EC Casp9 KO mice revealed that EC
Casp9 activates astroglial caspase-6. To further test the role of caspase-9 signaling on vascular-astroglial
communication, we will determine if astroglial caspase-9 (1) is upstream of astroglial caspase-6 and mediates
GFAP cleavage in RVO, (2) increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and (3) leads to retinal
neuronal death and visual pathway dysfunction. Understanding vascular-glial signaling in neurovascular injury
can help in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for neuroprotection. The focus of the postdoctoral phase
will be to study caspase signaling in glial cells and its contribution to retinal ganglion loss in Optic Neuritis
associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The ultimate goal of this F99/K00 proposal is to prepare me to be a
principal investigator and study how neuroinflammation is regulated in neurodegenerative diseases of the brain
that also affect the eye. To accomplish these goals, I developed a plan with mentors and collaborators to guide
my specific research and professional activities. With the opportunities for scientific and career development
available at Columbia, the objectives of this proposal are expected to be achieved."

This proposal describes a five-year training program and research proposal for the career development of Dr.
Augusto Schmidt as a physician-scientist in Neonatology with expertise in neonatal brain injury. Dr. Schmidt
completed his Pediatrics residency and Neonatology fellowship at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and is currently
Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Neonatology at the University of Miami (UM). Dr. Schmidt is
interested in determining the mechanistic relationship between mechanical ventilation and brain injury in preterm
newborns, and is particularly interested in how mechanical ventilation causes the lung to release exosomes,
which may induce brain cellular death and injury in preterm newborns. Dr. Schmidt will be mentored by Dr. Dalton
Dietrich and Dr. Shu Wu with the support of a scientific advisory committee. Dr. Dietrich, a world-renowned
expert in brain injury, will mentor Dr. Schmidt’s scientific progress and career development. Dr. Dietrich is the
Director of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and Distinguished Chair of Neurosurgery at UM and has been
committed to training scientists throughout his career having served as the principal investigator of a T32 Training
Program, thesis advisor of 9 PhD students, and mentored over 30 postdoctoral fellows. Dr. Wu is a neonatologist
and expert in neonatal lung injury and will complement Dr. Dietrich as a co-mentor. Dr. Wu has successfully
mentored more than 20 clinical and postdoctoral fellows and medical students. The advisory committee will
support Dr. Dietrich and Dr. Wu in mentoring Dr. Schmidt and will consist of Dr. Roberta Brambilla, an expert in
neuroinflammation, Dr. Eduardo Bancalari, a neonatologist and expert in neonatal chronic lung disease and Dr.
Alan Jobe, a neonatologist and accomplished physician-scientist, who has previously mentored Dr. Schmidt. In
this proposal, Dr. Schmidt will test the hypothesis that mechanical ventilation causes the lung to release
exosomes containing caspase-1 and that these exosomes cross the blood-brain barrier to activate Gasdermin
D (GSDMD) in the brain, inducing cellular death and brain injury. Dr. Schmidt will use a survival model of neonatal
rodent ventilation to test the following aims: (1) to determine the mechanistic function of GSDMD in inducing
neuronal cell death in ventilation-associated brain injury (VABI); (2) to determine the mechanistic function of
pulmonary-derived exosomal caspase-1 in activating neuronal GSDMD in VABI. Dr. Schmidt will use a
combination of pharmacological and genetic loss-of function mice models for GSDMD and caspase-1 to address
these aims. Brain injury and cellular death will be determined by a combination of techniques including
immunohistochemistry, western blotting, ELISA, and real time-PCR. Long-term outcomes will be assessed by
neurobehavioral testing. These pharmacological and genetic approaches will delineate the role of the exosomal
caspase-1 / neuronal GSDMD pathway in the development of VABI. This research will provide insight into new
pathways for therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat brain injury in ventilated preterm newborns and provide
the foundation for Dr. Schmidt’s research career focused on neonatal brain injury."
10862683,"Intermittent fasting (IF) is an alternative to daily calorie restriction for producing clinically relevant weight loss. 
Though intermittent fasting does not increase weight loss relative to daily calorie restriction, modifying the 
timing of food intake via intermittent energy restriction (IER) or time-restricted eating (TRE), two forms of 
intermittent fasting, may provide a pronounced benefit to glycemic control. However, these two IF approaches 
have not been thoroughly tested or compared in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Further, pancreatic beta 
cell responsiveness and insulin action in response to a mixed meal depend on a functionally normal incretin 
axis. Two insulinotropic peptides, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) are essential for postprandial glucose control. Incretin-stimulated insulin action contributes 
more than 70% of the insulin response to a meal in healthy adults, overshadowing the effect of glucose alone 
to stimulate insulin secretion. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the incretin response is blunted, contributing to 
poorer glycemic control. Similarly, higher levels of inflammation blunt insulin sensitivity. Intermittent fasting 
reduces inflammation and improves incretin expression in mice, however these effects have yet to be 
replicated in patients with T2D. Our goal is to evaluate potential mechanisms of benefit for two IF approaches 
on glycemic control in patients with T2D. The primary aim is to determine the effects of two forms of 
intermittent fasting on insulin action and whole-body insulin sensitivity. We will also compare changes in body 
composition between IER and TRE and conduct the first trial to determine the effects of both intermittent 
fasting approaches on the incretin response to a meal. In exploratory analyses, we will phenotype individuals 
based on metabolic assessments to determine potential predictors of response from each intervention. We will 
do this by leveraging and supplementing an existing randomized controlled trial utilizing both IF approaches 
within a 6-month multicomponent lifestyle change program incorporating a comprehensive health education 
program for diabetes via biweekly group meetings delivered remotely. Primary endpoints will be collected at 
weeks 0, 12, and 26, and 52 weeks. In addition to data already being collected on weight change, glycemic 
control via HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring, we will conduct a 3-hour, 9-point mixed meal tolerance 
test (MMTT) with glucose, insulin, and c-peptide to allow for estimates of insulin secretion and pancreatic beta 
cell function. Additionally, we will assess the effects of IER and TRE on body composition, incretin response 
and inflammatory cytokine levels during the 12-month intervention. Mixed models with repeated measures 
analysis will be used to assess the effect of each approach on outcome measures and, secondarily, to 
compare these two forms of IF. The long-term goal of our research is to determine whether intermittent fasting 
approaches are an effective alternative to standard of care for diabetes treatment. Secondarily, our goal is to 
determine which patients are most likely to benefit from either intermittent fasting regimen."
10932990,"ABSTRACT
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an often painful and disabling condition with few treatment options. For those with
pain and impaired quality-of-life (QoL) who have failed medical and endoscopic therapies, complete removal of
the pancreas may be considered with a procedure called total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant (TPIAT).
For many patients, TPIAT can be life-changing, with meaningful pain reduction. However, up to 20% have
significant persistent pain after TPIAT. We lack objective measures to predict who will respond to TPIAT. In
those who do respond, it is presumed that the pain is resolved simply because the pancreatectomy has removed
the visceral source of pain, while non-responders have more complex pain syndromes involving changes in the
central nervous system. Complementary work by our group in CP (without TPIAT) suggests that plasma or
urinary biomarkers may distinguish pain phenotypes.
The current proposal will leverage the largest TPIAT database and biorepository from a multicenter study of
patients undergoing TPIAT (POST study) to develop biomarkers that predict response to TPIAT. Of note: Dr. M.
Bellin, the PI of the POST study, is also PI on this application. In the NIDDK-funded POST study, over 400
enrolled participants underwent TPIAT, with detailed phenotyping for pain and QoL before and 1 year after TPIAT.
In addition, biospecimens including plasma and urine were collected before TPIAT in all consenting participants
(n=384) and 1 year after TPIAT in a subset (n=183) with in-person follow up. Based on preliminary data from our
and other labs, we hypothesize that a set of objective biomarkers from blood and/or urine can distinguish
those who benefit from TPIAT (pain reduction/relief) from those who respond poorly.
This clinical question is particularly important because TPIAT is a major, costly intervention with irreversible
lifelong health implications. In SA 1, we will identify plasma biomarkers collected before TPIAT that predict
persistent pain after TPIAT using samples and data from POST. Samples will be divided into FDA-compliant
discovery and validation groups. Pain response to TPIAT will be defined by opioid use and pain scores at 1 year.
Secondary measures for QoL and pain interference with daily function will also be assessed. In SA 2, we will
use the same approach to identify pre-TPIAT urine biomarkers that predict persistent pain after TPIAT. In SA 3,
we will assess change in biomarkers from pre-TPIAT to 1 year using plasma and urine biomarkers validated in
SA 1/2 (SA 3a) and also using a discovery and validation approach to identify additional plasma and urine
biomarkers that may have distinct patterns over time in patients with vs. without persistent pain (SA 3b).
Identifying plasma and urinary biomarkers will improve TPIAT patient selection, reducing negative impact on
patients and health care infrastructure. Data from this study will identify biomarkers that can also be investigated
in the larger populations with CP and other pain syndromes."
10837022,"The long-term objectives of this application are to understand how super-enhancers (SEs) control the
invasive growth and metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and to develop novel
therapeutics for HNSCC. HNSCC is highly invasive and resistant to cancer therapy and frequently metastasizes
to cervical lymph node, and patients with HNSCC have poor prognosis compared to other cancers such as
breast and colorectal cancers. Therefore, novel effective therapies need to be developed for HNSCC patients.
SEs are a genomic region that consists of multiple enhancers which are collectively bound by a set of
transcription factors and epigenetic readers to drive transcription of genes associated with cell identity.
Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is one of the four bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET)
protein family members. In SEs, BRD4 functions as an epigenetic reader that recognizes and interacts with
acetylated lysine residues on histone H3 and H4. Upon binding to the acetylated histones, BRD4 recruits the
Mediator complex, the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) complex, and other factors to facilitate transcription
initiation and elongation. Growing evidence suggests that SEs preferentially regulated the transcription of key
oncogenes in various cancers which can be selectively inhibited by BET inhibitors (BETi). To explore whether
SEs are a therapeutic target for HNSCC, we performed preliminary studies to characterize SEs in HNSCC, and
discovered that SEs selectively controlled the transcription of a set of oncogenic genes associated with cancer
stemness and invasion in addition to some common tumor-promoting genes. Using the newly-established
mouse model of HNSCC that allows us to trace cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vivo, we found that disruption of SEs
by BETi could potently eliminate CSCs and inhibit HNSCC invasive growth in vivo. We also showed that the new
BET degrader (BETd) potently inhibited the expression of cancer stemness and pro-invasive genes by inducing
BET family protein degradation. Based on these exciting preliminary studies, in this application, we hypothesize
that SEs control the expression of cancer stemness and pro-invasive genes, and targeting SEs by BETd might
help to eliminate CSCs and block tumor cell invasion, thereby improving anti-tumor efficacy and preventing
lymph node metastasis of HNSCC. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims: 1)
Determine whether disruption of SEs suppresses tumor invasive growth and metastasis and effectively
eliminates CSCs in a mouse model of HNSCC; 2) Determine whether the disruption of SEs inhibits the
self-renewal, tumorigenic potentials and metastasis of CSCs isolated from human HNSCC; and 3) Determine
how SEs are assembled in HNSCC and explore the molecular mechanisms by which disruption of SEs inhibits
cancer stemness and invasion of HNSCC. Novel findings from our studies may lead to the development of novel
strategies for the treatment of human HNSCC."

The Translational Pathology Shared Resource (TPSR) laboratory at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center
(SKCC) is dedicated to providing exceptional pathology faculty expertise, a comprehensive range of high-
quality, state-of-the-art histopathology technical support and service as well as cutting edge molecular
pathology and digital pathology services, and critical access to CAP-accredited biorepository facility for patient
samples to SKCC Members across the consortium and other researchers. TPSR is one of the 8 National
Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported Shared Resource Core Facilities at TJU. Because of its consistent service
support to NIH-funded research programs as well as clinical trials at TJU/TJUH research centers, TPSR was
always rated as Excellent to Outstanding during reviews ever since its establishment. The current autostainer,
a refurbished intelliPATH FLX®, was manufactured by Biocare Medical LLC and installed in August 2020. It
is remarkably slow (needs 6-9 hours/batch for single channel IHC) and lacks inline slides preparation (required
for fully automatic operation) and heating elements (required for In Situ Hybridization (ISH) and Terminal
Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assays). As a result, we lack the ability to
carry out molecular pathology tasks such as Multiplexed Immunohistochemistry/Immunofluorescence
(mIHC/IF), DNA/RNA ISH, TUNEL. Therefore, we request fund to acquire a new DISCOVERY ULTRA,
manufactured by Roche Diagnostics Corporation to establish a state-of-the-art molecular pathology
platform at TJU. Our preliminary instrument research and tests indicate that the DICSOVERY ULTRA is
ideally suited to meet our needs mentioned above. DICSOVERY ULTRA is a fully open automatic IHC/ISH
staining platform designed for research use only. It offers protocol flexibility for rapid assay development on
each individual slide (30 slides capacity in total) with both manual and/or fully automated IHC/IF, mIHC/IF,
ISH protocols simultaneously. The fully automated workflow enables processing of 90 slides in 8 hours, which
will improve turnaround times significantly. We have identified a group of eight core users from inside TJU
who eagerly support this proposal. If funded, TJU will cover the cost of ~$14,496/year for the service contract
after the first year, the cost of consumables in addition to other associated costs. The personnel will be
compensated through a combination of CCSG grant and the charge back. The proposed instrument will
significantly expand the service list of this shared resource, increase efficiency and productivity, enhance the
competitiveness of current NIH-funded research projects and expand the numbers of researchers using our
NCI funded Shared Resource, which will ultimately improve the quality, breadth and depth of our biomedical
research and strengthen the connections between basic, translational and clinical research."

Acute kidney Injury (AKI) associated morbidity and mortality is a major clinical problem that involves multiple
overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent observations from our team and others demonstrated that
intestinal microbiota modulates AKI outcome, however the underlying mechanism involved in intestinal
microbiota-kidney crosstalk, especially during the recovery phase, remain poorly understood. Our working
hypothesis for this grant application is that gut microbiota induces specific changes in the kidney T cell population
to mediate AKI outcome and recovery. Furthermore, we hypothesize that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
produced by certain gut microbiota communicate with kidney tissue via specific smell receptors, such as G
protein coupled receptor 41 (Gpr41), olfactory receptor 78 (Olfr78) and Olfr558 present in the kidney. To test our
hypotheses, we will (AIM 1) immunophenotype kidney immune cells from wild type (WT), antibiotic treated (AB)
and germ free (GF) mice at baseline, during the early phase of AKI, and during recovery of ischemic and cisplatin
induced AKI. We will conduct mechanistic studies using T cell deficient mice, T cell antibody depletion and
adoptive transfer studies targeting select T cells (e.g. CD4, Tregs, CD3+CD4-CD8- double neg) to determine
roles of select T cells on microbiome effects on AKI. Metagenomic and metabolomics with focus on immune
inflammatory pathways will be measured in AKI and recovery for identification of microbial communities and
metabolites. We will also perform colonization studies with specific bacteria, anti-inflammatory stool (from
pregnant mice) and probiotics in AB treated, GF and WT mice. Furthermore, effect of endotoxin released from
leaking gut on renal immune cells population will be investigated in studies using toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)
deficient mice. To study the role of SCFA signaling receptors in intestinal microbiota–kidney crosstalk (AIM 2)
we will induce AKI in Gpr41-/-, Olfr78-/- and Olfr558-/- mice to delineate role of SCFA signaling during AKI
recovery. We will identify immune cell or resident kidney endothelium/epithelial source of SCFA interaction with
Gpr41, Olfr78 and Olfr558 by evaluating kidney and immune cell specific SCFA receptor deficient mice and
performing bone marrow transplants. Additionally, SCFA producing bacteria and exogenous SCFAs will be
administered to Gpr41-/-, Olfr78-/- and Olfr558-/- mice and its effect examined on AKI outcomes. To make our
lab studies more relevant to human AKI, we will (AIM 3) perform metagenomics of pre and post stool samples
and blood metabolomics from patients undergoing cardiac surgery to find gut microbiota differences between
those that develop AKI and those that are protected. We will investigate the effect of human microbiota from
patients that develop AKI in AB treated, GF mice and SCFA receptor deficient mice. Successful completion of
these studies will help understand immunological effects of gut microbiota-kidney crosstalk and potentially novel
treatment options involving SCFAs and targeting intestinal microbiota, for AKI and recovery."

 Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of blood-related cancers characterized
by chronic inflammation and accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. Among lymphomas, CTCL is
uniquely characterized by the striking dermal tropism of transformed cells—where exposure to microbes might
contribute to disease etiology. CTCL patients often succumb to bacterial infections, and a correlation between
the presence of certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus and disease severity has been observed.
Commensal and pathogenic bacteria can influence differentiation of naïve T lymphocytes, trigger proliferation
and activation of T cells through production of superantigens (SAgs), and create a permissive
microenvironment for tumor cells by influencing chemokine and cytokine expression. We hypothesize that,
along with genetic predisposition of an individual and mutations acquired by T cells or T lymphocyte
precursors, exposure to S. aureus and SAgs produced by some strains of this pathobiont promotes malignant
transformation and clonal evolution in CTCL.
 Prior research by other groups and our preliminary studies implicate S. aureus specifically in CTCL
pathogenesis. We will isolate, sequence and study S. aureus isolates from the skin of CTCL patients (from
tumor sites and unaffected skin) and determine the repertoire of toxins and SAgs produced by these strains.
We anticipate that CTCL-associated isolates will differ in both the ability to produce large numbers of SAg
types per organism and the distribution of their SAg gene content. We will use in vitro methods to evaluate how
SAgs and other toxins and exoproteins produced by skin microbiota of CTCL patients contribute to T cell
activation, proliferation, and malignant transformation.
 To further understand the contribution of S. aureus to CTCL pathogenesis and to demonstrate a causal
connection between S. aureus colonization and malignant disease, we will use our new animal model of CTCL
and our germ-free facility to examine the impact of microbial exposure on CTCL initiation and progression. We
will also take advantage of cutting-edge, single-cell, high-throughput technology that enables simultaneous
analysis of surface epitopes, T cell receptor gene rearrangements, and transcriptomics to achieve
unprecedented resolution of the tumor microenvironment in CTCL and to examine changes in the
microenvironment upon S. aureus colonization.
 The studies outlined in our proposal will provide significant insight into CTCL pathogenesis and will inform
development of future therapies that are more targeted and less toxic than current chemotherapeutic
approaches."

The Master of Science in Occupational Health degree - Industrial Hygiene (MSOH-IH) program, founded in
1985, is administered by the School of Population Health in the College of Health and Human Services at the
University of Toledo – Health Science Campus. Since 1996, the MSOH-IH program has been accredited by the
Applied and Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC) of ABET, with the last cycle approved for the
period 2014-2020. The primary goal of the MSOH-IH program is to provide master-level education and training
to full- and part-time graduate students and members of the public for the purpose of increasing their
knowledge, comprehension, skills and attitudes essential to the advancement of occupational health and safety
science, practice and research. This is accomplished via a combination of theoretical, practical and applied
classroom, laboratory, and field teaching and research activities. The program educates and trains individuals
mainly from Northwest Ohio region. In turn, graduates are employed as occupational safety and health
specialists in the region. The MSOH-IH program adopted the ABET definition for ""Program Educational
Objectives"", ""describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years after graduation. Program
educational objectives are based on the needs of the program’s constituencies."" The three ""Program
Educational Objectives"" for the MSOH-IH program are: I) all graduates are expected to be qualified to practice
""comprehensive industrial hygiene""; 2) most graduates are expected to practice in the field of Industrial
Hygiene or related areas of Environmental and/or Occupational Health and Safety and to meet the relevant
and appropriate needs of their employers; and, 3) when eligible, based on degrees and post-graduate work
experience (i.e. 5 years post-graduation), most graduates who pursue applicable certification in occupational
health and safety (i.e. CIH; CSP; CHMM) will pass. The program is designed to educate and train 15-20 full-
time (FT) or part-time (PT) students per year, with funding requested for the FT equivalent of three NIOSH
trainees per year. Applicants to our Program are often employed full-time and our classes are offered in the
evenings and Saturdays, thus NIOSH has allowed us to award the scholarships to both FT and PT students.
The program expects 15-20 IH students to be enrolled in the Program annually over the project period. The IH
program at the University of Toledo has filled a critical gap in the Northwest Ohio occupational safety and
health workforce needs."

 Diaphragm weakness is a significant health problem in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced
ejection fraction (CHF) because it compromises ventilation and airway clearance and contributes to cardiac
arrhythmias, peripheral vasoconstriction, and limb muscle fatigue. A mismatch in production and scavenging of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), accompanied by oxidative modifications of myofibrillar proteins, is a critical
determinant of loss of specific force (i.e., contractile dysfunction) in CHF. In this proposal, our goal is to identify
the mechanisms which are causative in diaphragm redox imbalance and ROS-mediated contractile dysfunction
in CHF. Based on our data collected during the previous funding cycle and preliminary studies, coupled with
knowledge from the existing literature, we propose three specific aims to achievel our goal. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether downregulation of a transcription factor, which is known to regulate several redox genes, in
the diaphragm is sufficient and required for excess ROS and weakness in CHF. In Aim 2, we will define the
role and mechanisms of protein oxidation on diaphragm weakness in CHF. Our preliminary data suggests that
overexpression of enzymes that reverse oxidation of specific thiol groups prevents CHF-induced contractile
dysfunction. We will expand on these studies to define the protective effects of these enzymes in CHF-induced
diaphragm weakness and the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process. Aim 3 will test
oxidation of diaphragm α-actin (skeletal) as an essential molecular event in CHF-induced contractile
dysfunction. Actin is particularly relevant because it contains amino acid residues that are highly sensitive to
oxidation in regions critical for protein structure and function. We will use viral-mediated plasmid transduction
to elicit overexpression and knockdown of the relevant genes. The general main dependent variables are
diaphragm contractile properties in intact bundles and permeabilized single fibers, muscle ultrastructre, RNA-
Sequencing, ROS emission and markers of redox balance, and methionine redox proteomics. The aims and
experiments in our proposal will build an in-depth understanding of respiratory muscle biology, redox-mediated
contractile dysfunction, and identify novel mechanisms and targets to treat diaphragm weakness in CHF."

Fructose bisphosphate phosphatase (FBP1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis (GNG), whereas
nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 encoded by the NFE2L2 gene (NRF2) is a transcription factor, previously
identified as the master activator of the antioxidant defense response. NRF2 also activates the transcription of
many metabolic genes, especially in liver. We found that Nrf2Act-HEP mice, in which NRF2 was selectively activated
in hepatocytes, and fasted Fbp1ΔHEP mice, in which FBP1 was conditionally deleted in hepatocytes, exhibit similar
metabolic phenotypes, including hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis and hypertriglyceridemia, which
are also manifested by insulin overdosed individuals and glucose- or carbohydrate-deprived FBP1-deficient
children. Given these similarities, we asked whether NRF2 and FBP1 engage in biochemical crosstalk.
Surprisingly, we found that hepatic activation of NRF2 induces FBP1 degradation, mediated by NRF2 induced
EGF and PDGF expression, which through an autocrine signaling mechanism led to activation of ERK1/2 MAP
kinases that phosphorylated FBP1 at serine 271 and triggered its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
Even more surprising was the finding that FBP1 expression led to inhibition of AKT, thereby relieving inhibitory
phosphorylation of GSK3 isozymes, which phosphorylate a degron embedded within the NRF2 molecule and
thereby induce its ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These findings led us to hypothesize that the NRF2-FBP1
crossregulatory loop is a key regulator of liver metabolism and homeostasis, whose aberrant function can
promote liver damage and cancer. We plan to test this hypothesis through three specific aims: 1). Investigate
the hypothesis that FBP1 induces NRF2 degradation in periportal hepatocytes by activating GSK3 or enhancing
its recruitment to NRF2; 2). Determine whether NRF2 activation alters liver zonation and contributes to the
metabolic defects caused by FBP1 ablation; 3). Investigate whether NRF2-induced FBP1 degradation or NRF2
upregulation control the progression from chronic metabolic stress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Pursuing these
aims via new mouse models, cell biological studies and highly innovative Seq-Scope technology, which we had
developed for high-content spatial transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of single liver cells, will answer several
critical questions of general importance: 1). What are the non-enzymatic mechanisms through which FBP1 has
a broad effect on liver metabolism beyond its well-studied involvement in GNG? 2). What is the role of NRF2 in
the metabolic alterations caused by FBP1 deficiency? 3). What is the role of a previously described FBP1-
aldolase B interaction in AKT inhibition and GSK3-induced NRF2 degradation? and 4). What is the role of AKT
activation in the metabolic defects and increased susceptibility to oncogenic transformation exhibited by the
FBP1-deficient liver?"
10854866,"SUMMARY
T cells can discriminate between diseased and non-diseased states. To make this distinction, the information
provided by extracellular receptors must be interpreted by signaling networks within the T cell. Most notable is T
cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling network because it combines a receptor that scans the surface of human
cells for threats and signaling proteins that ensure a highly sensitive and specific response. This TCR signaling
machinery can detect small quantities of an antigenic agonist and discriminate it from a background of structurally
similar endogenous ligands. The overarching goal of my research group is to elucidate how the TCR signaling
machinery discriminates between TCR ligands by producing distinct signaling outcomes. The past few decades
have revealed how the TCR is coupled to signaling proteins within the T cell, but much less is known about how
these signaling proteins are coordinated to produce different cellular responses, such as whether a TCR ligand
should be ignored, or cause the T cell to become activated. The underlying mechanisms used to produce context-
specific TCR signals must be determined to fully realize the potential of T cells as therapeutic entities for the
treatment of human disease. Regulatory mechanisms can diversify signaling by controlling the activity of
signaling proteins, such as kinases, and their assembly into protein complexes. We propose to determine how
TCR signal diversification can arise from (1) negative feedback loops, (2) differential assembly of signaling
complexes, and (3) adaptive desensitization of TCR signaling. To interrogate these mechanisms of signal
diversification and their effect on a T cell response, we will combine chemical tools with immunological
approaches. We will use proximity labeling and mass spectrometry analyses to determine how the composition
of signaling complexes is altered by kinase-responsive negative feedback and TCR-ligand binding properties.
We will also evaluate more long-term mechanisms of receptor desensitization caused by adaptive transcriptional
changes by RNA sequencing. These datasets will be generated and analyzed with our collaborators at the
University of Michigan Medical School, which includes the Proteomics Resource Facility and Advanced
Genomics Core."
10854868,"Abstract. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) breast cancer is diagnosed at advanced stages.
Many women present with a palpable breast mass, which is rare in communities where breast screening is
available. In addition to limited imaging facilities, prolonged diagnostic delays (76-630 days) due in part to the
extreme shortage of pathologists (as few as 1 per million/population) contribute to a 5-year mortality rate up to
4 times higher than that in the US. An innovative solution to this problem could be an affordable, easily deployable
molecular test to identify and prioritize women likely to have a malignancy for expedited biopsy and pathology
review. It is well established that early detection of breast cancer improves survival. With our industrial partner,
Cepheid, we propose to build on our published breast cancer detection prototype to develop an affordable, <3-
hour, automated breast cancer detection (aBCD) assay that analyzes a panel of hypermethylated genes in breast
fine needle aspirates (FNAs).The proposed innovations will cut the assay time in half, and reduce costs by at
least 3-fold to provide a single-cartridge assay for quick cancer detection. In Aim 1a, we will optimize the
Offboard bisulfite-mediated DNA conversion method and test its efficiency in Patient Set 1 FNAs (N= 29
malignant, 25 benign). In Aim 1b we will select one optimal 5-marker panel and test its performance using first,
the gold standard, FFPE samples (N= 30 malignant, 30 benign), and then, Patient Set 2 FNAs (N=35 malignant,
35 benign). In Aim 1c, we will perform technical validation of the aBCD assay. Intra-assay reproducibility will
be assessed on multiple sample collections of Patient Set 3 FNAs (N=30 malignant, 30 benign). Inter-operator
reproducibility will be determined using replicate FNA slides from Patient Set 2 (N= 35 malignant, 35 benign).
The goal of Aim 2a is to perform clinical validation of the aBCD assay. We will first select a threshold in a
Training set of FNAs: Patient Set 4 (N=100 malignant, 100 benign) to optimally balance sensitivity and specificity,
and validate performance of the selected threshold in a Test set of FNAs: Patient Set 5 (N= 180 malignant, 180
benign). We will measure the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive- and negative-predictive value) of
aBCD-based diagnosis to distinguish benign versus malignant lesions using histopathological diagnosis of the
core biopsy as the gold standard. Lastly, in Aim 2b, to determine whether select patient characteristics alter the
performance of the aBCD assay, we will test its clinical accuracy among specific patient subgroups based on
age, race, BMI, and tumor characteristics (grade, stage, tumor subtype). All these steps are necessary to ensure
an accurate and reliable test. This intervention is paradigm shifting, and could revolutionize the current detection
of breast cancer in underserved regions of the world by expedited treatment and, in turn, saving thousands of
lives yearly. This study will also facilitate further development of the aBCD assay toward commercialization,
making it accessible globally."
10852458,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
In this project, we seek to test the hypothesis that age-related perturbation of interorgan communication signals
emanating from the hematopoietic (blood-forming) system may be a common driver of age-associated
dysfunction across the body’s major organ systems. This possibility is based on recent human studies, which
document an unexpected increase in the likelihood of diseases affecting non-blood organs in individuals with
clonally expanded, mutant blood cells. To test our hypothesis, we will apply a novel in vivo gene editing system
to introduce into mouse blood cells specific somatic mutations that are frequently associated with clonal
hematopoiesis in aging humans. Mutations will be induced in situ, in discrete subsets of endogenous blood
cells of otherwise normal young or aging mice, using a lineage-selective, virus-based gene editing system. We
will then monitor these animals over time for the emergence of mutant blood cell clones and of well-
characterized, age-associated pathologies in three different non-hematopoietic organ systems – the skeletal
muscle, heart and brain. Each of these organs shows profound and well-defined alterations with advancing
age, and prior studies demonstrate that aging pathologies that arise in each of these non-blood organs shows
responsiveness to blood-borne (systemic) signals. Our proposed studies also will compare the possible
differential effects of different mutations occurring in distinct target genes, each associated with aging of the
human blood system, and evaluate whether the lineage restriction (cell type) or timing (age of onset) of the
mutagenic event has any impact on subsequent organismal pathology. Finally, we will apply rigorous single
cell sequencing, heterochronic parabiosis and serum analyte assays to uncover the molecular mediators of
aging-relevant blood-to-non-blood organ communication networks. In this way, our experiments will directly
test the hypothesis that age-associated clonal mutagenesis is a mechanistic driver of aging
pathologies that disrupts interorgan communication between the hematopoietic system and other
tissues, identifying the specific cellular contexts and mutagenic events occurring in the aging blood system
that can drive dysfunction in the cardiovascular, neurologic and skeletal muscle systems through cell non-
autonomous signals. Ultimately, the results of these studies will offer new guidance for the clinical
interpretation and management of individuals identified to harbor clonal hematopoiesis, estimated to represent
more than 20% of individuals over the age of 70 (and potentially nearly all individuals who reach very old age)
and important new insights into the significant interorgan communication mechanisms that contribute to aging
and disease."

Human vision starts when photoreceptors collect and respond to light. Normal photoreceptor function is
essential for normal vision, yet techniques to assess these processes in vivo are limited. New optical modalities
that are rapid, specific, and non‐invasive promise to greatly expand our capability to monitor more accurately
and completely photoreceptors.
This study takes advantage of unique adaptive‐optics OCT instrumentation developed in my laboratory in
conjunction with custom algorithms for sub‐cellular image registration and phase‐sensitive detection to
measure anatomical and physiological properties of individual photoreceptors. We will use this technique to
investigate three specific aims that quantify the spectral sensitivity profiles of photoreceptors, the expression of
photoreceptor spectral types in color vision deficiencies, and the temporal dynamics of photoreceptor loss in
retinitis pigmentosa patients. The long term goal of this research is to establish high resolution, high specificity
optical techniques as valid tools for probing structure and physiologic processes of the retina at the cellular
scale. The resulting ability to study cells in vivo will improve early detection of and treatment monitoring for
diseases that impact the retina."

 Smoking is increasingly concentrated in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations that might not have
been reached by the policies and communication campaigns to the same degree as the more prosperous
groups. In the rapidly changing media landscape, new approaches to developing and testing messages are
needed. This project will use an innovative combination of qualitative, eye tracking, and quantitative (discrete
choice experiment, randomized clinical trial) studies to develop and evaluate tobacco education message
strategies delivered on digital channels that communicate complex scientific concepts to the public, particularly
the priority populations. These strategies will be developed in the context of the FDA-proposed ban on menthol
in cigarettes and flavors in cigar products (“flavor ban”). Flavor ban has the potential to save hundreds of
thousand of lives, but can be undermined by misinformation and misperceptions. Little research has
systematically documented the misperceptions or developed messages to correct them. Our project proposes
to address this important gap by developing and testing strategies to reach priority populations with messages
on digital channels. This project will provide that research by pursuing these specific aims: (1) Identify effective
message attributes for digital channels using a co-creation approach; (2) Quantify the relative importance of
different attributes of digital messages using a combination of a discrete choice experiment and an eye-
tracking study; and (3) Test the impact of messages on behavioral outcomes in a context of digital social media
in a randomized clinical trial with a nationally representative sample of flavored combusted tobacco product
users. The results will help eliminate tobacco-related disparities and increase the effectiveness of tobacco
educational messages among the population for whom anti-tobacco messages have not been optimally
effective."

10857224,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Although interactions between the senses of smell and taste are a key factor for guiding food choices, the
neural mechanisms underlying the multisensory integration of odors and tastes remain largely unknown. A more
thorough understanding of these neurobiological processes will provide better insight into diseases characterized
by unhealthy food choices, such as obesity or diabetes. Eating food simultaneously activates the olfactory and
gustatory systems to generate enduring odor-taste associations. The primary cortical area for taste, gustatory
cortex (GC), is a principal site of convergent gustatory and olfactory information. Recent work from our lab
determined that functionally distinct populations of neurons in GC represent different properties of individual
unpaired odors or tastes. However, how neurons in GC represent odor-taste mixtures, as well as the neural
mechanisms that underlie integration and processing of smell and taste remain unclear. Recent behavioral and
physiological studies show that cortico-cortical interactions between sensory cortices are fundamental to
multisensory integration, suggesting that projections from the functionally distinct anterior (aPC) and posterior
(pPC) regions of piriform cortex (i.e., olfactory cortex) modulate multimodal chemosensory processing in GC.
Using rats as a model system, this proposal will combine behaving electrophysiology and optogenetic techniques
to investigate how the circuit between neurons in GC and the functionally distinct regions of piriform cortex
mediates multisensory integration of odors and tastes. The Specific Aims will test the following hypotheses: Aim
1: Different populations of neurons in GC encode the chemical identity and hedonic value of odor-taste mixtures.
Aim 2: Neurons in GC that respond to both odors and tastes receive aPC input representing the chemical identity
of odor-taste mixtures. Aim 3: Neurons in GC that respond to both odors and tastes receive pPC input
representing the hedonic value of odors and odor-taste mixtures. The results of each Specific Aim will contribute
fundamental knowledge about the cortico-cortical circuitry underlying the integration of smell and taste and
provide a necessary prelude for investigating the role that these cortico-cortical circuits play in guiding food
choices."

Tuberculosis remains one of the top ten leading causes of death worldwide (1). Based on the most current
information from WHO 2020 report, in 2019 an estimated 1.4 million people died from TB and approximately
10,000,000 fell ill (2). The COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive decreases in TB case identification and Stop
TB estimates an additional 1.4 million TB deaths will be registered over the next 4 years (3, 4). This, together
with the growing threat of drug-resistant TB and the co-epidemics of TB with HIV and diabetes makes ending
the TB epidemic more crucial than ever before. A vaccine that prevents adolescents and adults from acquiring,
developing, and transmitting TB would be the single most cost-effective tool in ending the TB epidemic (5).
The TuBerculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) and Treatment Action Group (TAG) TB Vaccine Pipelines report
twelve subunit vaccines including recombinant protein/adjuvant and viral vector vaccines spanning from
preclinical through Phase 3 development (6, 7). Of these, nine include Ag85 (Ag85A or B) and six include
ESAT6. The highly limited antigenic and immunological diversity present in the pipeline is a significant gap in
efforts to develop a novel, effective vaccine. The proposed research is intended to bring needed antigenic and
platform diversity to the pre-clinical TB vaccine pipeline using Moderna’s cutting-edge mRNA vaccine
technology and expertise.
Within the R61 phase of this program, we will first optimize mycobacterial antigen sequences for expression in
mammalian cells using Moderna’s proprietary learnings and algorithms. These principles will be applied to the
development of three candidate mRNA vaccines, including 1) an antigen cassette previously shown to induce
protection in animal models when delivered as a protein plus adjuvant, 2) a new antigen cassette
including novel antigens, and 3) the M72 antigen shown to induce protection in humans when delivered as
recombinant protein with the AS01E adjuvant. We will then use data from murine immunogenicity and protection
studies to select the two best candidates for advancement into the R33 phase. Within the R33 phase, we will
use the guinea pig challenge model to downselect to a final lead candidate for further advancement. Once a final
lead candidate is selected, additional studies will be conducted to further characterize the candidate, including
protection in genetically diverse mice and an immunogenicity study in nonhuman primates to optimize the
vaccination regimen for clinical use.
By the end of this program, we will have a novel lead vaccine candidate ready for advancement into IND-
enabling studies and early development as a vaccine to prevent TB disease in adults and adolescents."
10857347,"A growing body of scientific evidence demonstrates that secure attachment and sensitive caregiving are
important sources of resilience for children living in stressful environments (e.g., Graham & Easterbrooks,
2000), contributing to children’s mental and physical health (Shonkoff, 2016). Conversely, research indicates
that insecure attachment is an important risk factor for the development of both childhood behavior problems
and physiological dysregulation (e.g., Luijk et al., 2010; see Fearon et al., 2010, and Groh et al., 2012, for meta-
analytic findings). Thus, efforts to prevent insecure attachment are crucial for children’s healthy development.
Although a few promising approaches to preventing insecure attachment, physiological dysregulation, and
childhood behavior problems have emerged (see Berlin et al., 2016), none has achieved widespread
implementation. What is urgently needed is evaluation of a comprehensive theory- and research-based
intervention protocol that can be widely implemented among families whose children are at elevated risk for
developing or maintaining insecure attachments, physiological dysregulation, and behavior problems.
 The goal of the proposed study is to conduct an RCT of the Circle of Security – Parenting (COS-P)
intervention within Early Head Start (EHS) programs, in light of evidence that EHS children and families are
characterized by factors (e.g., low income, parental depression, exposure to violence/trauma; USDHHS,
2006a) that leave them at increased risk for insecure attachment and behavior problems. The project
addresses the NICHD CDBB priority of promoting psychosocial adjustment for at-risk children and of
understanding contributors to positive outcomes that can occur despite high-risk environments. Moreover,
the project addresses a critical barrier to progress in the attempt to reduce the risk of negative outcomes among
at-risk children by testing the efficacy of an intervention that was designed in collaboration with families and
staff from the real-world contexts in which it will be implemented. Principal aims are to examine whether the
addition of this brief attachment-based intervention to regular EHS services will (1) reduce child insecure
attachment, physiological dysregulation, and behavior problems; and (2) promote sensitive parental responses
to child distress. Additional aims are (3) to examine potential moderators of intervention effectiveness and (4)
to test whether changes in parental response to child distress act as a mechanism of positive change.
 We have chosen HS/EHS as a strong service delivery mechanism because it is a widely available resource
in many communities, with an infrastructure and a commitment to the mental health of children. The HS/EHS
program has shown positive outcomes in some areas, yet evidence of reducing the risk of insecure attachment
is lacking (Spieker et al., 2005). The approach we take is noteworthy in that we consider the broader public
health context in which our attachment-oriented prevention protocol can be widely implemented.
 The RCT includes 249 parent-child dyads from the Harrisburg, PA and Lehigh Valley, PA EHS programs."

Reciprocal interactions among neuronal, glial and vascular-associated cells are critical for proper vascular
development (angiogenesis) and maturation [establishment of the blood-retina barrier (BRB)] in the early
postnatal (P) retina. Although neuronal or glial cell-derived signals that promote angiogenesis and BRB
formation2 are emerging, we do not understand how neuronal synaptic activity, in general, and which specific
neurotransmitter(s), in particular, contribute to these processes. Nor do we know whether neurotransmitters act
directly on endothelial cells (ECs) or indirectly via Müller glia. The superficial vascular plexus develops from
P1-P9 during the spontaneous cholinergic wave. In contrast, the deep vascular plexus development and BRB
maturation (P10-P14) occur at the end of the cholinergic wave and the onset of both spontaneous and
photoreceptor-mediated glutamatergic activity. Transient pharmacological blockade of cholinergic waves
delays deep plexus angiogenesis and BRB maturation; however, the role of extracellular glutamate in these
processes is unknown. In preliminary studies, we have used two mouse strains to assess the effects of
glutamate release on retinal angiogenesis and BRB maturation: a) Vglut1 -/- mice that lack glutamate release in
the synaptic cleft and b) Gnat1-/- mice that constitutively release glutamate in the synapse. We have found that
neuronal activity-dependent glutamate release is a positive regulator of deep plexus angiogenesis and BRB
maturation. These effects are mediated by induction of Norrin in Müller glia and Norrin/b-catenin pathway
activation in ECs. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that extracellular glutamate levels are
sensed by Müller cells, which in turn operate as transducers to induce expression of angiogenic and BRB-
forming factors and promote deep plexus angiogenesis and BRB maturation. We will test this hypothesis in
three aims. First, we will examine how modulation of extracellular glutamate levels [Vglut1-/- mice (no glutamate
release) and Gnat1-/- mice (high glutamate release)] regulates retinal angiogenesis and structural and
functional BRB integrity in the developing retina. We will also examine how glutamatergic and cholinergic
activity interact to regulate these processes. Next, we will test whether Müller cells sense extracellular
glutamate and respond by inducing expression of angiogenic and barriergenic factors. We will examine Müller
cell responses and Norrin expression (an angiogenesis factor) by Müller cells in mice deficient for glutamate
release by neurons or uptake by Müller glia. Finally, we will test if activation of Norrin/b-catenin signalling, that
promotes angiogenesis and BRB maturation, in ECs can rescue deficits of Vglut1-/- mice. Overall, our studies
will provide a novel mechanistic understanding of how glutamatergic synaptic activity regulates development of
the deep vascular plexus and BRB maturation in the developing retina and elucidate how glutamate
excitotoxicity may affect blood vessels in neurodegenerative retinal diseases."

 Households, classrooms, hospitals, workplaces, and other close contact settings are major venues for
the spread of many infectious pathogens. Because they allow epidemiologists to follow a well-deﬁned
population at risk of infection, longitudinal studies of infectious disease transmission in these settings can
generate unique insights into the determinants of infectiousness and susceptibility, the evolution of in-
fectiousness over time in infected individuals (the infectiousness proﬁle), and the effectiveness of control
strategies (e.g., vaccination or masking). However, such studies are rarely done and are often analyzed us-
ing statistical methods designed for chronic diseases or population-level surveillance data, which can re-
sult in severe bias. To realize the enormous potential of these studies to inform public health responses to
infectious diseases, it is critical to develop user-friendly and versatile software tools that provide access to
statistical methods designed for close contact settings. This software must also support the proper calcu-
lation of statistical power and sample size in order to aid the design of observational studies and interven-
tion trials in these settings. Based on our extensive experience in methodological research and code devel-
opment for a variety of infectious diseases in close contact groups (including inﬂuenza, Ebola, norovirus,
cholera, SARS-CoV-2, etc.), we propose to develop a user-friendly, versatile, and computationally efﬁcient
R package called TranStat. Our team of epidemiologists, biostatistician, and computational biologists
will achieve the following Speciﬁc Aims: (1) To integrate independent implementations of discrete-time
chain binomial models and continuous-time pairwise survival models into a single R package. This aim
will unify data input, model speciﬁcation, and output formats for the two packages while improving user-
friendliness, computational efﬁciency, functionality, and documentation. (2) To develop simulation tools to
calculate power and sample size for observational studies and intervention trials in close contact settings.
This aim will support the design of epidemiological studies of infectious disease transmission in house-
holds, classrooms, congregate housing facilities, workplaces, etc., that can inform control strategies. (3) To
build capacity to handle missing data in outcomes and covariates and to account for unobserved hetero-
geneity in transmissibility (e.g., superspreading). This aim will allow users of TranStat to retain partially-
observed data in their analyses to maximize statistical power while avoiding bias and accurately quanti-
fying uncertainty. The integrated, expanded, and freely available TranStat package will allow epidemi-
ologists to generate detailed and reliable scientiﬁc insights by studying infectious disease transmission in
close contact groups. Through these insights, TranStat will help policy-makers, public health ofﬁcials,
and the public work together to control epidemics more effectively."
10857226,"Women with positive margins after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) have a 2-fold increased risk of cancer
recurrence and are recommended to undergo additional re-excision surgery to achieve negative margins.
Additional surgery is associated with significant emotional, cosmetic and financial burdens for patients and their
caregivers. Although radiography, frozen section, touch prep and MarginProbe are available for intraoperative
margin assessment, their accuracy is variable and most, except radiographic examination, are time- and labor-
intensive and not routinely used. Since publication of the 2014 SSO-ASTRO guidelines for invasive cancer
recommending re-excision for positive margins only, the re-excision rates have decreased but remain substantial
(14-18%) with significant variation among surgeons. Because the size of BCS specimens varies significantly (a
few to >40 cm2 per margin) and positive margins often include one or multiple sites/foci, a device with both
variable margin coverage and microscopic resolution that can accurately evaluate an entire surgical specimen
within a few minutes is highly desirable. While new technologies have been proposed, they are either point or
high resolution devices with a very small field-of-view that requires excessive time to scan a specimen, or wide-
field devices with low resolution and poor sensitivity. None has demonstrated the capability of analyzing an entire
lumpectomy specimen with both adequate resolution and time efficiency in a clinical setting. Our goal is to
develop a deep learning (DL) enabled, deep ultraviolet (DUV) scanning microscope (DDSM) for subcellular
resolution and rapid (<5 min) examination of freshly excised tumor specimens during BCS. We hypothesize that
there are significant subcellular optical contrasts that can be identified by the DDSM to differentiate breast cancer
cells from normal tissue. Our preliminary DUV images demonstrate excellent contrasts and accuracy for
identification of breast cancer cells. We propose that large and variable margin coverage, microscopic resolution
and high speed are achieved by using: 1) DUV light for surface excitation of fresh specimens; 2) parallel imaging
of two margins; 3) a low optical manification for fast speed; and 4) DL and sparse-sampling (SS) to rapidly search
for pathological features of cancer cells. In Aim 1, a novel DDSM instrument will be developed and used to image
120 fresh breast tissues. DL classification algorithms will be developed and validated using the 120 tissue
samples in Aim 2. Aim 3 will integrate DL and SS algorithms into the DDSM and demonstrate for fast detection
of variable amount of cancer cells on the surfaces of breast tumor specimens. DDSM is highly innovative,
combining DUV microscopy, parallel imaging, DL classification, and SS in a fast, compact, automated design.
During initial BCS, if the DDSM accurately and efficiently identifies positive margins, additional breast tissue
would be removed from the surgical cavity until negative margins are achieved and unnecessary removal of
additional tissue would be avoided, thus decrease the need for additional surgery. DDSM is a platform technology
that can be used with other imaging modalities or adapted for detection of other cancer or noncancer conditions."
10857228,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on describing the
comprehensive long-term experience of trauma from the perspective of older adults and their family caregivers.
The candidate is currently an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Duke University and acute and critical care
trauma surgeon, with previous research experience in trauma-related outcomes and healthcare disparities, and
has now chosen to focus on aging research, qualitative analysis, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
research with a diverse mentoring committee of investigators with expertise in geriatrics, gerontology, surgery,
critical care, and qualitative research. The proposed experiments and didactic training will provide the candidate
with a unique set of skills that will help her transition to independence as a surgeon-scientist and enable her to
fill a significant “experience gap” in the field of research dedicated to the older adult trauma patient population.
Traumatic injury currently effects 5.4 million older adults each year in the United States representing 23% of all
trauma admissions, and these numbers are projected to climb as the population ages. The consequences
resulting from trauma to older adults are magnified when compared to younger age groups. Older adults have
an increased likelihood of death as a result of trauma, with one-third of patients with presenting with multisystem
trauma dying prior to leaving the hospital. Indeed, trauma is the 5th leading cause of death in older adult patients.
Recent research suggests that the impact of trauma on older patients, their family members, and health care
systems is dramatic. Despite these findings, very few high-quality studies have been conducted to describe the
long-term experience of trauma from the perspective of these patients and their respective caregivers. Indeed,
very little is known from the patient perspective regarding post-discharge trajectories through care facilities, the
impact of functional limitations, and what factors are associated with poor outcomes. Compounding this problem
is that it remains unknown which existing quality of life measurement instruments may be optimal for older adult
trauma patients. These gaps in knowledge regarding this patient population serve to make the process of
informed, shared decision making about goals of care challenging for older patients, their family caregivers, and
clinicians. This proposal will characterize the one-year patient healthcare experience of older adult trauma
patients and their family caregivers using a concurrent nested mixed-methods study design, using both
qualitative and quantitative methods consisting of a survey and concept elicitation interviews. Specifically, the
work of this proposal will 1) identify aspects of quality of life (QoL) among older adult trauma patients and how
these change over time, 2) characterize the caregivers experience over one year, and 3) identify a core set of
both patient- and caregiver-reported HRQOL measures that address key domains identified through the
interviews, and determine which measures are most effective at different time points post-trauma."
10857229,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The number of Americans with Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias will nearly triple by 2060 without major
scientific advances in knowledge of modifiable factors that can be targeted using interventions. One modifiable
psychological resource linked to the preservation of cognitive functioning involves the beliefs people hold about
their ability to influence important outcomes in their lives (perceived control). However, little is known about how
(mechanistic pathways) perceived control protects against short-term and long-term declines in cognitive
functioning or whether its protective influence differs across populations that vary in risk of cognitive decline due
to disparities in socioeconomic resources. These critical knowledge gaps are due to limitations in prior research
that has largely focused on establishing main effect associations between perceived control and cognitive
functioning over either very brief (one-week) or very extended (multi-year) time windows. In this new investigator
application, we will address these problems using a real-world, contextual approach to systematically assess
how and under which conditions perceived control buffers against declines in cognition across multiple time-
scales (days, months, years). We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) identify the motivation, emotion, and
health behavior change processes that mediate the association between perceived control and multi-timescale
changes in cognitive functioning; 2) determine the extent to which the association between perceived control
and multi-timescale changes in cognitive functioning is more pronounced for middle-aged and older adults with
limited socioeconomic resources. We will pursue these aims using an innovative approach that generates new
micro-longitudinal data and also leverages pre-existing macro-longitudinal data. New micro-longitudinal data will
be collected on dynamic daily and monthly changes in perceived control, motivation, emotion, health behaviors,
and cognitive functioning in a regional sample of 200 middle-aged and older adults (4 weekly bursts over 1.5
years). Pre-existing macro-longitudinal data on 9-year changes in the same measures will be obtained from the
national Midlife in the United States study. This unique approach permits a systematic analysis of the mediated
(Aim 1) and moderated (Aim 2) pathways linking perceived control to changes in cognition that unfold over days,
months, and years. The proposed research will address the urgent need to identify modifiable psychological and
behavioral factors underlying socioeconomic disparities in cognitive aging and the timescales (days, months,
years) at which these factors have their strongest influence. This knowledge will inform evidence-based
approaches on when (at which timescale) it is most effective to target changes in psychobehavioral resources
to preserve cognitive functioning for populations at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias."

Miscarriage is the most common pregnancy complication in the United States, occurring in 15-20% of all
clinically recognized pregnancies. It has devastating impacts on both parents, with elevated anxiety and
depressive symptoms in the mother, and even post-traumatic stress disorder, lasting up to a year post-event.
Identification of modifiable risk factors of pregnancy loss, thus, is of great public health importance. Ambient air
pollution is an increasingly recognizable risk factor for pregnancy complications. Although some evidence
exists linking air pollution to pregnancy loss, the need to identify pregnancy loss events through medical
records is a large hurdle in comprehensively assessing this association. For the proposed work, we will employ
a novel approach that uses the outcome metric of live birth-identified conceptions in a variation of the time
series design to overcome this major limitation of all existing studies. To this end, we will use information on all
live births recorded in Denmark between 1997 and 2017, and couple these with highly spatio-temporally
resolved air pollution predictions from well-validated models. Specifically, we will (1) investigate the association
between both particulate matter air pollution exposures, an indicator of the mixture of air pollution, and traffic-
related air pollution, a component of ambient air pollution found to be especially toxic for pregnancy
complications, and pregnancy loss; (2) identify the critical windows of vulnerability; (3) develop novel
methodology to assess potential effect modification by multiple modifiers simultaneously while incorporating
the highly resolved time-varying exposures during gestation; and (4) identify maternal- and neighborhood-level
effect modifiers, and therefore, the most susceptible subpopulations to air pollution impacts. Our findings can
greatly inform targeted regulations and policies, crafting of public health messages, and targeted interventions."

Despite limited knowledge about their toxicity and health effects, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) has
increased among former smokers and young adults who have never smoked. Increasing evidence shows that
e-cig aerosol contains relatively high levels of toxic metals, including lead and nickel, metals with strong
evidence for a role in cardiovascular (CV) disease. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate (1) the
association of e-cig use with metal exposure, (2) the association of e-cig use with coronary artery calcification
and other relevant pathways (endothelial cell health, blood pressure and inflammation), and (3) the potential
role of e-cig metals to explain, at least in part, the CV effects of e-cigs. In preliminary studies, we found marked
increases in metal levels in the generated aerosol compared to e-liquid from the dispenser from devices of
daily e-cig users, demonstrating that the heating coil is a source of metal exposure. Metals in e-cig aerosols,
moreover, were positively associated with metal biomarker levels. We will conduct a longitudinal study of men
and women 18 to 50 years of age of diverse race/ethnic backgrounds from New York City (130 never tobacco
smokers or e-cig users (controls), 130 e-cig users who are never tobacco smokers, 130 e-cig users who are
former smokers, and 130 e-cig users who are current smokers and evaluate each participant 3 times over a
1.5-year period (month 1, 9, and 18). For exposure assessment, we will collect data on e-cig use and use
patterns from a questionnaire and 4-weekly mobile assessments (month 3, 6, 12, 15), an aerosol sample from
the participants' e-cig device and urine and blood samples to measure metals. For outcome assessment, we
will measure coronary artery calcification (CAC) using cardiac CT-scan at baseline estimating the spatially
weighted calcium score (SWCS). The SWCS provides a valid, continuous measure of CAC suitable for
quantifying the extent of atherosclerosis without a threshold. At each visit will also measure endothelial cell
health through endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation using EndoPAT2000 device and endothelial cells-
derived microparticles (EMPs) (a marker of endothelial cell injury), blood pressure, and biomarkers of
inflammation (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). We will estimate differences in metal biomarkers and in CV
risk comparing e-cig users to non-users and by e-cigarette use patterns (e.g., type of device, number of puffs,
e-liquid consumed per week, type of coil). In a formal mediation analysis, we will assess the association of e-
cig use with the CV measures accounting for the mediating role of metals. The proposed longitudinal study
utilizes interdisciplinary expertise in the characterization of CV disease, assessment of metals, the recruitment
and examination of e-cig users, and the general field of tobacco regulatory science, to fill a critical gap in the
knowledge about the possible long-term effects of e-cig use and to help inform e-cig regulatory action."
10846737,"Metabolic Diabetes Clinic at Vanderbilt: Project Summary
Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center (VDRC) investigators have been on the forefront of development,
standardization, implentation and dissemination of new concepts and technqiues to study mouse models of
metabolic diseases. The expertise of the VDRC has been available to the national research community for the
last 20 years through the NIDDK Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (MMPC) Program, with the Vanderbilt
MMPC playing a critical role. As the VDRC was engaged in strategic planning for this competitive renewal,
NIDDK made the decision to sunset the national MMPC program. Investigators outside Vanderbilt who had
used the VMMPC contacted us to express concern about how current and future scientific projects could be
conducted without the mouse services of the VMMPC. In response this input and a survey of more than 40
outside users, the VDRC proposes to create a national resource, the Mouse Diabetes Clinic at Vanderbilt
(MDC), to provide investigators nationwide with unique and sophisticated tools to study the mouse. The MDC,
led by experienced VDRC faculty and a highly skilled staff adept at complex procedures to study metabolism in
healthy, unstressed mice, will provide investigators outside Vanderbilt critically needed mouse-related services.
Skilled mouse surgeons will perform difficult catheter, cannula and probe implantations and provide surgery-
based mouse models to study diabetes and metabolism. Stable and radioactive isotopes will be used as
needed to delineate control of metabolic flux rates in mouse models of metabolic disease. Experience over the
past 5 in the VMMPC (> 13,000 services to 98 outside investigators from 66 institutions leading to 74 papers)
predicts a robust
MDC usage
. The MDC will also continue to provide important educational programs for the
diabetes community, including a weeklong course that has been given 20 times over 15 years focused on
mouse metabolic techniques. In summary, the MDC will facilitate diabetes research by providing novel services
that are feasible at few other institutions to a large number of diabetes investigators outside Vanderbilt."

We are establishing a Pilot Research Project Core (Pilot Core) as part of our Center with the overarching goal
of building a pipeline of investigators with the skills and experience to conduct high quality, cutting edge, and/or
rapid response research in substance abuse and prevention. We will do so through three aims: (1) Administer
the selection of and supervise the execution of research pilot studies that utilize biomarkers in substance
abuse and prevention research; (2) Enhance the quality of substance abuse and prevention research among
students and fellows, new and early stage investigators, and established investigators who do not have
expertise in drug biomarkers; and (3) Support substance abuse and prevention research among
underrepresented racial/ethnic minority faculty across the United States.
To accomplish Aim 1, the Pilot Core will utilize UCSF's Resource Allocation Program (RAP) for grant
solicitation, submission and review. The Pilot Core will fund at least one innovative pilot project annually. For
Aim 2, the Pilot Core will provide postdoctoral fellows, new and early stage investigators, and established
investigators who do not have expertise in substance use or drug biomarkers with assistance on sample
collection, study design, and data analysis, along with other services related to conducting drug studies in
humans. Finally, for Aims 3, the Pilot Core will leverage UCSF's Learning for Early Careers in Addiction &
Diversity (LEAD) Program to support substance abuse and prevention research among underrepresented
racial/ethnic minority faculty from universities across the U.S. through analytical chemistry support on their
LEAD-funded projects.
These three aims will advance the field of substance abuse and prevention research by facilitating the conduct
of pilot studies to spur larger projects, supporting researchers who do not yet have experience or expertise in
drug biomarkers, and supporting the training of underrepresented racial/ethnic minority faculty researchers in
the field of substance abuse and prevention research."
10846741,"Pilot & Feasibility Program (P&F): Project Summary/Abstract
The P&F program has funded 132 projects (including 2020) since its inception in 1978. This program has
been extremely valuable and effective by providing funding for the support of diabetes-related projects. The
goal of the program is to support small research projects by new investigators (who have little or no
independent research support) or established investigators who are turning to diabetes research for the first
time. Most of the proposals are in the former category (i.e., 13 of 15 grant awarded between 2016-2020).
Three new projects are normally initiated each year. After a university-wide solicitation of proposals, three
individuals (two internal and one external to the institution) review each grant. The critiques of the proposal are
evaluated by the P&F Review Committee (equivalent to an NIH study section), and each proposal is assigned
a priority score. The proposals and priority scores are then presented to the DRTC Executive Committee
(equivalent to the NIH Council) for a funding decision. Support for a second year of research is awarded when
satisfactory work is completed in year one and if support for the projects has not been obtained in the interim.
The success rate of this program, measured either by the number of investigators who remain involved in
diabetes research, publications, and/or who convert their P&F into a nationally awarded, peer-reviewed grant,
is very high. In addition, this program funds applications from a wide variety of Departments/Divisions within
the institution. For example, faculty members from Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Rheumatology,
Cardiovascular Medicine, Pulmonary, Endocrinology, Ophthalmology, Engineering, and Biological Chemistry
were funded over the past four years. The P&F program also provides visibility for the VDRC within the
Vanderbilt scientific community and thus makes the scientific community more aware of its research efforts and
core facilities. The importance and effectiveness of the VDRC P&F program is underscored by the decision of
the Vanderbilt leadership to continue to provide additional P&F funds for this program in the next funding cycle."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is maintained by a small minority of self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
Defining and targeting the key molecules that specifically regulate LSCs might eradicate AML. Heat shock
transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is known to regulate the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) to protect cells
from misfolded protein-induced proteotoxic stress. Although HSF1 is not an oncogene, it enables cancer cells
to accommodate imbalances in signaling and alterations in DNA, protein, and energy metabolism, a
phenomenon called “non-oncogene addiction”. Targeting HSPs in AML is being explored with promising
results. However, targeting HSPs induces feedback that increases HSF1 activity, which may compromise
treatment effects. Therefore, targeting HSF1 directly may be a more attractive alternative. However, given the
critical roles of HSF1 in the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis, targeting HSF1 could adversely affect
normal hematopoiesis. Unexpectedly, our preliminary data show that HSF1 is dispensable for normal
hematopoiesis, but specifically required for the self-renewal of LSCs. Mechanistically, deletion of HSF1
disrupts amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which plays a critical
role in regulating LSC function, and dysregulates multifaceted genes involved in LSC stemness. In addition, we
identified that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a) as a direct HSF1 target. Overexpression of HNF4a largely
reconstitutes deletion of HSF1-induced impaired LSC function. Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that HSF1 is specifically required for LSC self-renewal through regulating leukemic energy metabolism
(mainly OXPHOS) and is a potential therapeutic target in AML. We propose the following two specific aims
to test our hypothesis. Aim 1: To determine the underlying mechanism whereby HSF1 is specifically required
for LSC self-renewal. We will determine 1) the impact of HSF1 ablation on LSC frequencies, proliferation and
OXPHOS; 2) the HSF1 transcriptional targets in LSCs by comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic gene
expression, chromatin accessibility and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing in the presence or
absence of HSF1; 3) how HNF4a reconstitutes HSF1 ablation-induced LSC defects, especially the effect of
HNF4a on OXPHOS; and 4) if deletion of HSF1 impairs mechanistically different types of AML. Aim 2: To
determine if targeting HSF1 effectively eliminate human LSCs. We will determine 1) the impact of HSF1
inhibition on human LSC proliferation, apoptosis, self-renewal and oxidative phosphorylation; 2) the HSF1-
dependent regulatory circuitry in human LSCs; and 3) if the expression of HSF1 protein correlates with AML
therapeutic response and relapse. The expected outcomes of this comprehensive analysis are identification of
the mechanism whereby HSF1 specifically regulates LSC self-renewal, providing the rationale for targeting
HSF1 and using HSF1 to monitor AML progression."

Role of glial circadian clock dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease
Chronic disruptions of the circadian system, manifesting as sleep disturbances, day-night confusion, and
“sundowning”, are well-described and debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). While circadian
disruption has long been considered a consequence of the degenerative process in AD, accumulating human
and mouse data suggest that circadian rhythm abnormalities may begin before overt cognitive symptoms, and
could play an important contributory role in AD pathogenesis. Circadian rhythms are generated in cells by
specific clock genes, which are expressed in neurons and glia throughout the brain and control 24-hour
oscillations in transcription. These cellular clocks are synchronized to the external environment by the central
clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain. Cellular circadian clocks are particularly robust in glial cells,
regulating cellular activation and inflammatory responses in both astrocytes and microglia. We have found that
the circadian clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrocyte activation, neuroinflammation, and amyloid plaque
deposition in mice. We have also found that amyloid plaques cause large-scale alterations in circadian
transcriptional rhythms in astrocytes. Thus, we will address the bidirectional relationship between circadian
clock disruption and AD-related pathology in mouse models of AD, focusing on how the central and cellular
clocks regulate astrocyte responses to protein aggregation. Using novel methods to interrogate cell type-
specific transcription in vivo, we will compare the effects of central vs. cellular clock disruption on circadian
function in astrocytes, both in healthy brain and in a model of AD. We then evaluate the effects of central and
cellular clock disruption on pathology caused by Aβ and tau, and determine specific clock-regulated pathways
in astrocytes that control protein degradation and inflammation. By understanding the bidirectional relationship
between circadian rhythms and astrocyte function, we hope to identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent
protein aggregation and inflammation in Alzheimer’s Disease."

My long-term goal is to determine the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil response in health and disease and
how they are altered by the presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. Traumatic injuries are a
leading cause of death and disability in younger people being a major public health problem worldwide.
Neutrophils are known for their fast and moldable inflammatory response upon injury, which are massively
recruited after trauma. Neutrophils play a crucial pathological role in the complex systemic inflammatory
response that leads to life-threaten situations. Patients with chronic low-grade systemic ""metabolic"" inflammation
display a dysregulated neutrophil response and function. Consequently, these patients are at high risk of
developing serious complications and exhibit a high mortality rate after trauma. Knowledge of how
metainflammation impacts neutrophil response in polytrauma is limited, particularly in what concerns the
regulatory mechanisms that coordinate and direct neutrophil recruitment to sites of concurrent traumatic injuries.
Trauma affects the phenotype and function of neutrophils, which impairs the neutrophil capacity to fight infections
while at the same time promotes tissue damage phenotypes that contribute to the overall immune dysfunction.
These alterations on neutrophil populations set the stage for secondary inflammatory complications such as
sepsis, multiple organ failure (MOF), and nosocomial infections that delay recovery and can lead to disability or
death. It is also unclear how traumatic injury sites reprogrammed neutrophils and if it is dependent of trauma
localization, or the patient’s overall inflammatory status. In this MIRA application, we plan to investigate
mechanisms involved in neutrophil phenotypic and functional modulation in polytrauma. We will take advantage
of the remarkable zebrafish animal model known for its optical transparency and ease of genetic and
pharmacological manipulation to visualize, track and deconvolute the molecular mechanism involved in the
neutrophil response in polytrauma at a whole-animal context. We will combine our zebrafish polytrauma model
and unique whole-animal non-invasive live imaging approach with genetic manipulation and protein, lipid,
transcript, and epigenetic profiling of neutrophils and concurrent traumatic injury sites to evaluate 1) the
regulatory mechanisms that coordinate neutrophil recruitment to concurrent traumatic injuries, 2) how neutrophils
are reprogrammed at sites of traumatic injury to generate specific neutrophil subsets that reverse migrate and
disseminate inflammation in trauma, and 3) how chronic inflammation impacts such processes. Our research
will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the neutrophil mechanisms involved in polytrauma inflammatory
response in healthy and metainflammation settings. The knowledge achieved by the proposed research will
enable us to manipulate neutrophil response as a means by which to improve patient outcomes following trauma,
particularly in high-risk groups."

 Language difficulties have been reported in nearly 70% of people with tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC), but language development is poorly understood in this population. Further, 50%
of individuals with TSC develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD); language deficits are also
common in ASD. In a preliminary study, we found deficits in early vocal development in most
infants with TSC regardless of the diagnosis of ASD. Thus, the goal of our current proposal is to
examine potential predictors of language outcome and ASD severity in infants with TSC.
 In Aim 1, we will code audio-video recordings of infants from TACERN (Tuberous
Sclerosis Autism Center of Excellence) for canonical babbling (a precursor to language) and
volubility. We will compare canonical babbling and volubility to a non-vocal measure, shared
attention, in predicting language outcome and ASD severity at 12 months as measured by the
Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS).
 Aims 2-4 will entail a new longitudinal study of the trajectory of language development
and predictors of language outcome and ASD severity. Language will be measured using LENA
(Language ENvironment Analysis) recordings (Aim 2); a fast-mapping paradigm (Aim 3) and the
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MCDI) (Aim 3). Shared attention
will be measured using the ESCS (Aim 2). Each measure will generate potential predictors of
outcome. We will examine how these measures predict language outcome as assessed by the
Preschool Language Scale 5 (PLS-5) (Aims 2-3) and autism severity as measured by the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at 36 months (Aim 4).
 Currently, despite the high risk of language difficulties and ASD in TSC, very little to no
data are available about the origin and trajectory of language in TSC and how this might predict
outcome. Data generated under this Award will serve as the foundation of an independent
research program dedicated to the intersection of TSC neurobiology and language
development."
10847498,"Project Summary
Neurotechnologies used to treat brain disorders and diseases can drastically change brain function and behavior,
monitor brain activity, and collect and transmit personal health data. Industry-academia (IA) partnerships play a
critical role in bringing neurotechnologies to market for public benefit. However, there are significant ethical
issues that emerge from these partnerships, especially given the unique capacities of neurotechnologies. If these
ethical challenges are not handled appropriately, scientific integrity can be undermined and the objectivity in the
design, development, and commercialization of neurotechnologies can be jeopardized.
This project addresses a gap in our current understanding of ethical complexities in industry-academia (IA)
partnerships within the neurotechnology enterprise by engaging relevant neurotechnology stakeholders (e.g.,
industry, researchers, ethicists, university officials, patients) to identify promising and practical solutions for
addressing these ethical complexities. This project builds logically across three aims that culminate in the
development, dissemination, and evaluation of a toolkit that includes stakeholder-informed guidance for ethically
and responsibly navigating IA neurotechnology partnerships.
Aim 1 will use in-depth interviews with neurotechnology stakeholders to identify risk factors and ethical
challenges for IA partnerships, including in the design, conduct, reporting, and application of neurotechnology
research. Aim 2 will involve a Delphi consensus panel of neurotechnology stakeholders to establish best
practices and solutions for mitigating risk and addressing ethical issues that emerge from IA partnerships. Aim
3 will include developing, disseminating, and evaluating a toolkit that provides guidance and resources for
neurotechnology stakeholders to help them ethically and responsibly navigate neurotechnology IA partnerships.
We will recommend adoption of specific solutions for each stakeholder group.
This is the first project to systematically and simultaneously engage diverse neurotechnology stakeholders to
develop practical and actionable guidance for ethical and responsible IA neurotechnology partnerships. We will
develop the first publicly accessible stakeholder-informed toolkit that can be adapted to current and forthcoming
neurotechnologies resulting from IA partnerships. Taken together, this project will have considerable impact on
the conduct of neurotechnology research by identifying practical solutions for balancing scientific values with
fiduciary goals."
10847499,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is 40–100% higher among Black compared
with White Americans. A key reason for this disparity may include residence in segregated, socially disadvan-
taged, and polluted communities. Extant studies suggest that community socioeconomic deprivation is related
to decreased brain volume, Alzheimer’s neuropathology, and poor cognitive function, and that fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) may contribute to neurodegeneration. Early-life exposures may be particularly important, as
early-life community-level disadvantage and ambient air pollution could disrupt the accumulation of cognitive
reserve, reduce cognitive resilience, and dampen social trajectories. Community-level social factors and air
pollution often co-occur; thus, comprehensive understanding of how these factors operate independently and
synergistically requires rigorous evaluation of both. Moreover, identifying the extent to which these factors
modify underlying genetic risk—APOE-ε4 genotype and ADRD polygenic risk scores—would inform under-
standing of the etiology of ADRD. The overall objective of this application is to evaluate the effects of early-life
community-level social and environmental factors on late-life ADRD and the extent to which these factors con-
tribute to racial disparities on ADRD in a nationally representative sample. The central hypothesis is that early-
life community-level social factors and ambient air pollution have independent and synergistic effects on late-
life brain health and ADRD disparities.
This project leverages the recently completed data linkage between the 1940 census and the national Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) (n≈8,700). Participants in the HRS were an average age of 69 years at first
memory assessment between 1995–1998, so HRS includes up to 23 years of longitudinal data on memory
scores and dementia, and a subsample also has genotype information. The central hypothesis will be tested in
four specific aims among Black and White HRS participants: (1) Investigate the effects of early-life community-
level social factors on late-life cognitive health; (2) Examine the effects of early-life ambient air pollution expo-
sure on late-life cognitive health; (3) Estimate synergistic effects of early-life community-level social factors and
air pollution exposure on late-life cognitive health; and (4) Evaluate the extent to which early-life community-
level social factors and exposure to ambient air pollution modify effects of ADRD genetic risk on late-life cogni-
tive health. The proposed research is innovative because it assesses joint early-life social and environmental
community-level exposures, including via novel air pollution metrics and late-1930s redlining, for ADRD. The
proposed work is expected to advance the field by providing new policy-relevant evidence on potential strate-
gies to prevent ADRD and eliminate ADRD disparities."
10841983,"The protein kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathways play crucial roles in regulating cell
growth, survival, and metabolism in response to changes in cellular energy and nutrient status. Despite
significant efforts, our understanding of mTOR pathways still has many gaps that need to be filled. To
address the knowledge gaps, our research will focus on three directions. Firstly, we will investigate the
mechanisms by which mTOR controls the initiation and termination of autophagy. Although our knowledge
in this area has significantly improved, we still do not clearly understand how post-translational modifications,
interactions, and translocations of autophagy regulators are coordinated to drive autophagy initiation.
Furthermore, while mTOR regulates autophagy termination, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.
Secondly, we will investigate how cells decide between autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis during energy
crisis caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Our recent study has challenged the long-held notion that
autophagy is responsible for supplying energy to energy-deprived cells for survival. Contrary to the prevailing
concept, we found that energy-deprived cells restrain autophagy and mitophagy via activating AMPK, the
major energy sensor kinase in mammalian cells. Our research has revealed previously unrecognized roles
of ULK1, the central kinase that regulates autophagy downstream of mTOR, in the crosstalk between
autophagy, mitochondria, and apoptosis. This finding highlights the critical importance of maintaining
functional mitochondria for autophagy. Investigating the coordination mechanism underlying the crosstalk
between autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis during energy stress is crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of cellular energetics for cell survival. Thirdly, we will investigate the functions of mTOR in
different cellular compartments. The majority of previous studies have focused on lysosomal mTOR, with
limited explanation of how lysosomal mTOR controls protein synthesis and autophagy initiation that primarily
occur in the endoplasmic reticulum. While non-lysosomal functions of mTOR have recently emerged, their
roles in different cellular compartments remain largely unexplored. Through our single-molecule analysis,
we have learned that the majority of mTOR exists in non-lysosomal compartments and that some forms of
non-lysosomal mTOR are responsive to amino acids, providing unprecedented insights into mTOR
distribution and regulation in various cellular locations. Addressing this critical knowledge gap is essential
for elucidating previously unrecognized functions of mTOR. Through these three directions of research, our
study aims to advance fundamental knowledge on mTOR functions in coordinating nutrient, growth, and
energy status with autophagy, mitophagy, and cell survival. Additionally, the outcomes of this study are
expected to provide crucial insights into the cellular pathways for energy sensing and response, as well as
the mechanisms by which cells cope with energy stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."

A mechanistic understanding of reactivity has enabled the development of nearly all modern synthetic organic
chemistry, which has in turn revolutionized the discovery and production of therapeutics to treat human diseases.
Yet, traditional ensemble analytical tools for investigating mechanisms, like NMR spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry, measure primarily the major components in mixtures and provide averaged and non-spatially
resolved information, thus missing key reaction intermediates and distributions of behaviors. Approach: Here,
focusing on two challenging systems—aqueous–surfactant emulsions for sustainable organic chemistry in water
and the synthesis of organometallic reagents and catalytic intermediates directly from metal powders—we now
develop fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) methods. These methods overcome the limitations of
prior analytical techniques and, we propose, lead to exciting insights into previously poorly understood classes
of organic reactions and processes. Innovation: The experiments described here are the first FLIM studies of
any synthetic organic chemistry reactions or processes under preparative conditions. We innovate by using this
spatially resolved fluorescence lifetime data to characterize reaction intermediates, assign fates of catalysts,
understand reaction mechanisms, and create predictive reaction models. Significance: Information gained from
these FLIM studies provides guiding principles for surfactant selection and medium recycling in sustainable
aqueous–organic systems, efficient methods for accessing organometallic reagents, and tactics for lowering
temperatures, ligand quantities, and/or catalyst amounts in carbon–carbon bond-forming cross-coupling
reactions. We focus our efforts on understanding and developing areas of high significance: organozinc,
organocopper, and organopalladium reagent and/or catalytic intermediate syntheses, as well as Negishi, Suzuki,
and Heck cross-coupling reactions, with applications in the synthesis of drug-like molecules. Beyond uncovering
guiding principles, we plan to develop next-generation chemical imaging agents and strategies, including
autofluorescence methods that function in the absence of exogenous imaging agents. Instead, these methods
will harness the inherent fluorescence lifetime and emission signatures of native reaction components. Once
developed, these imaging tools will be primed for use by our laboratory and others for the broader study of
mechanisms and processes in synthetic organic chemistry. Expertise in our diverse team uniquely encompasses
fluorescence microscopy, FLIM, organic synthesis methods development, transition-metal chemistry, catalysis,
surface characterization, and mechanistic studies—exactly the angles needed for the success of this ambitious,
multidisciplinary proposal, as demonstrated by robust preliminary results and an impactful publication record.
Together, these studies have a positive impact because they lead to efficient, sustainable routes for the
construction of carbon–carbon bonds and organometallic reagents and catalysts, thus facilitating the next
generation of therapeutic agents used to treat human diseases."
10842087,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cytokinesis is fundamental to life, and the septins form cytoskeletal scaffolds or diffusion barriers of distinct
architectures to impact diverse cellular functions including cytokinesis, cell migration, ciliogenesis, dendritic
spine morphogenesis, spermiogenesis, and bacterial infection. Defects in cytokinesis or septins cause
lethality or serious diseases including cancer, infertility, hereditary neuropathy, and neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Thus, understanding cytokinesis and the septin cytoskeleton
is critically important not only for basic science but also for public health.
In this application, we will address the core issues regarding cytokinesis including the architecture and
constriction mechanism of the actomyosin ring (AMR) as well as the mechanism of vesicle fusion at the
division site. We will also address the key questions in the septin field including how a high-order structure
such as the septin ring or hourglass is assembled and then remodeled into a distinct architecture for a
distinct function. These questions will be addressed chiefly using the budding yeast model due to the
stereotyped behaviors of cellular and molecular events involved in cytokinesis and septin architecture and
remodeling during its cell cycle. Some of the key questions such as the architecture of the AMR, especially
the organization of distinct myosin-II isoforms in the contractile ring, will also be investigated in fission yeast
and mammalian cells to illustrate the mechanistic conservation and divergence during evolution. All
questions will be addressed using an integrative approach that combines precise genetic editing, cell
synchronization, AlphaFold2-based structural predictions, biochemical analysis, and cutting-edge imaging
technologies including super-resolution microscopy, platinum-replica EM, and cryo-FIB-SEM/cryo-ET.
We have made major contributions to the understanding of cytokinesis and the septin cytoskeleton. The
proposed project is based on rigorous published and unpublished data, which sets the stage for testing
specific hypotheses and exploring new directions. The completion of this project is expected to generate
deep architectural and mechanistic insights into cytokinesis and septin assembly and remodeling."
10842118,"The use of enzymes in synthesis has had an enormous impact on the development of bioactive
compounds, as they can perform transformations with unparalleled selectivity at a low cost without
using toxic solvents. However, there is a dearth of enzymes that catalyze C-C bond formation on
preparative scales. Many common enzymes from central metabolism have exquisite substrate
selectivity or rely on coupling to downstream reactions as a thermodynamic driving force, limiting
their utility. We have identified a suit of pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes that
catalyze stand-alone C-C bond forming reactions that are mechanistically distinct from their
counterparts in central metabolism. We propose mechanistic analysis of these enzymes,
encompassing structural, kinetic, and spectroscopic studies, that will reveal how these enzymes
form high-energy intermediates that are shielded from destructive interactions with solvent. This
information will enable hypothesis-driven strategies to alter and improve enzyme function. In an
allied effort, we are exploring new strategies to increase the efficiency of screening-based directed
evolution. Assaying mixtures of substrates in direct competition, followed by resolution and
quantitation of the products contain a wealth of un-tapped information. We will explore how to
maximize the information present in substrate mixtures and how to use multiplexed data to guide
evolutionary steps that are driven by either changes in total activity or by changes in specificity.
These advances in engineering will synergize with our practical efforts to evolve C-C bond forming
enzymes to perform new catalytic reactions. This research will have immediate impacts because
the enzymes will produce non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). Nature often uses ncAAs bearing
side chain stereocenters to tune bioactivity, but the structural complexity of these molecules
makes many out of reach for standard organic chemistry. The ncAAs made here will add new and
valuable diversity to the medicinal chemistry repertoire.

10843780,"1. PROJECT SUMMARY
 Oral drug delivery via the gut mucosa is considered more patient-friendly than an intravenous infusion or
subcutaneous injection regarding induction of treatment. The practical advantages include reduced need for
trained medical personnel, cost efficiency, and increased safety. While progress has been made increasing
stability and innate activation of potential orally delivered mucosal drugs, significant knowledge gaps exist at the
intercellular and intracellular levels, which leaves poor understanding of the specific and non-specific factors
determining recognition and transport of drug candidates across the intestinal epithelia. Furthermore,
understanding how nanoparticles-based oral drug delivery systems transport through intestinal epithelium and
how the transport behavior can be manipulated through surface modification to create guided transport pathways
through intestinal epithelium will provide fundamental and essential knowledge on future design and
development of effective drug delivery systems for oral administration. Thus, there is an urgent need to fill these
gaps in learning because the intercellular and organ level interactions and resultant biological influences are
critical for precise control of nanoparticles-based oral drug delivery systems targeting intestinal mucosa and
mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). My long-term goal is to study and rationally design nanoparticles-
based oral drug delivery systems to treat inflammatory and infectious diseases. My overall objective in this project
is to determine how artificial virus-like nanoparticles (AVNs) based drug delivery systems target and transport
within a gut mucosal immunological model. My central hypothesis is that the mammalian orthoreovirus cell
attachment protein σ1 (MRV σ1) functionalized polymeric AVNs will target delivery through induced M-cells to
MALT cells in the intestinal epithelium ex vivo and in vivo. The rationale for the proposed research is that in-
depth knowledge of the parameters determining recognition and transport of nanoparticles across the intestinal
epithelia and guided vehicle of oral drug delivery in vivo will be gleaned. The harvested knowledge will further
equip us to understand genetic changes of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and MALT cells during reprogramming
progression and offer new insights to develop orally available drug delivery strategies to treat inflammatory and
infectious diseases. If it is successful, my strategy would be instrumental in developing precise and efficient
methods and formulas for producing rationally designed oral drugs for clinical applications, thereby
fundamentally advancing the fields of oral drug delivery."
10843786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases where chronic
inflammation and its sequelae significantly impact a patient’s physical health, quality of life, and healthcare
utilization. Early diagnosis of GI inflammation could prompt earlier medical intervention with a direct impact on
patient’s prognosis and quality of life. There is a need for novel methods capable of detecting early and low-
grade GI inflammation. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of fluorescence lifetime imaging
(FLIm) for detecting early colorectal inflammation in vivo. Without requiring exogenous labeling agents, FLIm is
sensitive to changes in cellular metabolism, which is altered at the onset of inflammatory processes.
Our specific aims focus on establishing FLIm as a research tool to quantify and monitor inflammation at the
tissue level using the in vivo murine colon as a model. In Aim 1 we will (sub-aim 1.1) fabricate a side-viewing
endoscopic probe for nondestructive, in situ, and in vivo intraluminal imaging of the full length of the colon and
(sub-aim 1.2) show that FLIm is sensitive to epithelial metabolism using wild-type and PPAR-g knockout mice
treated with antibiotic (streptomycin) to generate transient dysbiosis and with 5-ASA to protect against antibiotic
effects. In Aim 2 we will test the relevance of FLIm for detecting early inflammatory changes with a model that
recapitulates aspects of pre-IBD (high-fat diet and antibiotics). Using image processing and statistical analysis,
we will validate the FLIm parameters with histopathology and biochemical assays (H&E, tissue hypoxia,
intracellular lactate, NAD+/NADH, ADP/ATP, PDH activity) performed after necropsy (n = 6 animals/group for
both male and female mice). The broad range of inflammatory responses generated with this study will
demonstrate the sensitivity of FLIm as a research tool for label-free, nondestructive, in vivo intraluminal detecting
and monitoring the host response to GI inflammation.
Results from this research are expected to provide convincing preliminary data for subsequent R01-type
research grant applications that build on the proposed concept. The long-term goal of the PI is to establish FLIm
as a nondestructive and label-free, in situ and in vivo, mesoscopic imaging modality to study 1) pathogenesis
and treatment of GI inflammation over time, 2) the host-microbiota relationship with pharmacological and dietary
changes, and 3) to translate this approach into a clinical tool for in vivo endoscopic imaging of the human GI
tract. We anticipate that the applications of the proposed implementation of FLIm range from early detection of
inflammatory and infectious diseases and cancer to the close monitoring of pharmacological and nutritional
treatments on the GI tract."
10843787,"Project Summary
This proposal aims to resolve the molecular basis for activation of an atypical receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
family – ALK. The ALK family consists of two receptors, ALK and LTK. ALKs are involved in neuronal
development and, like other RTKs, are critically important in numerous cancers. In particular, ALK is the
oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma – an aggressive and often lethal childhood cancer. Significantly, ALK
receptors are distinct from the 19 other RTK families (56 receptors in total). Perhaps most prominent, they do
not share the standard RTK architecture. Typically, RTKs are composed of multiple repeats of common domains
(e.g. Ig, fibronectin, cysteine-rich) in their extracellular region. On the contrary, ALK’s extracellular ‘sensory’
region is highly enriched in glycines (termed the glycine rich domain, GRD). Only recently the ALK GRD has
been shown to be a receiver for Augmentor (AUG) signals. Augmentors are small peptides with ~50 highly
conserved amino acids that are sufficient for stimulating ALKs kinase activity. Given ALK’s remarkable molecular
design, we expect ALK to have an equally distinguishable mechanism of receptor control – potentially broadening
the paradigm for RTK regulation. Despite the importance of this receptor family in cancer, surprisingly little is
known about how the receptor functions: 1) there are no reported structures for the GRD, AUG or their complex,
and 2) it remains unknown how engagement of ligand translates into receptor kinase activity. The research
proposed here focuses on understanding the molecular mechanism of ALK and LTK activation by AUG. With
this foundation we hope to reveal how oncogenic dysregulation usurps the control mechanisms in place during
normal development. Our goals over the next 10 years are: 1) To develop a complete mechanistic understanding
of how ALK receptors perceive Augmentors and transmit their signals, 2) To understand how receptor mutations
and matrix changes alter ALK signal transduction in cancer and 3) to determine if ALK’s unique structural and
regulatory elements present novel targets for therapeutic interventions. We will study ligand-receptor complexes
biochemically and with structural techniques, in order to understand in detail how AUG peptide binding leads to
activation of ALKs in the signaling complex. In pursuing studies of ALK’s activation, we will investigate how
preclinical monoclonal antibodies and discovered Fabs modulate and inhibit ALK function. In sum, our studies
will provide necessary fundamental insight into signaling by this unique family of receptors that does not fit into
the canonical RTK schema. Understanding the mechanism of receptor activation in this family will be crucial for
designing and deploying effective inhibitors that will need to differ from those targeting other well-studied RTKs.
In addition, our findings will reveal the signaling differences induced by common cancer mutations that will steer
clinical strategies to approach ALK dependent diseases."
10843896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Bacterial populations, including those that affect human health, are largely controlled by
bacteriophages. Phages change the composition of bacterial ecosystems and strongly influence
bacterial evolution. Defense mechanisms that protect bacteria from phages are important
regulators of these host-pathogen interactions. Defining these mechanisms is crucial to
understanding bacterial compositional dynamics and pathogenicity. CRISPR-Cas systems are
sophisticated and diverse mechanisms that allow bacteria to memorize infection events and
defend themselves upon reinfection. In addition to their important role in mediating bacteria-
phage interactions, CRISPR-Cas systems have been harnessed for genome manipulation
technologies that have greatly facilitated biomedical research and have enormous potential for
human therapies. The goal of our research program is to fully define the mechanisms and
specificities of a variety of nucleic acid-protein complexes that direct CRISPR-mediated
immunity and have potential for CRISPR technology. Our program is divided between
understanding the process of adaptation, during which a bacterial cell is immunized, and
interference, during which the CRISPR-Cas system neutralizes an infection. We and others
have recently discovered higher-order adaptation complexes containing poorly defined protein
subunits that are essential for effective immunization. Our goal is to uncover the molecular steps
that enable specificity and precision by higher-order adaptation complexes, ensuring productive
immunization events. Following immunization, Cas effector complexes that neutralize infection
during interference must quickly recognize pathogens, a task made even more challenging
when phages evolve and evade detection. Our goal is to understand how Cas effectors can
maintain effective immunity even in the face of pathogen evolution. Through this research
program, we will contribute to the overall understanding of how CRISPR-Cas systems impact
bacterial populations and help ensure that CRISPR-based research and therapeutic tools are
used safely and effectively."
10843897,"The goal of this study is to characterize the molecular mechanisms that detect Ca2+ rises in
synaptic terminals and identify how these components drive synaptic communication between
neurons using the Drosophila model. Research from my lab and others has demonstrated the
importance of the Synaptotagmin (Syt) family of Ca2+ binding proteins in translating synaptic
Ca2+ dynamics into the regulation of neuronal communication. Given mutations in
Synaptotagmins have been found to cause both CNS and neuromuscular disorders in humans,
it is essential to understand how this protein family regulates synaptic communication.
Presynaptically, Ca2+ entry triggers synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion through a synchronous phase
that occurs within milliseconds, and a slower asynchronous phase that can last for hundreds of
milliseconds. Postsynaptic Ca2+ influx also regulates membrane trafficking at synapses to drive
retrograde signaling pathways that link neuronal activity and synaptic growth. In Aim 1, we will
define how Syt1 interfaces with Complexin and the SNARE complex to control whether SVs
fuse synchronously, asynchronously or spontaneously. We will also determine how mutations in
human Syt1 and Syt2 dominantly disrupt SV fusion and lead to neurological disease. In Aim 2,
we will characterize how Syt7, a popular candidate for the asynchronous and short-term
facilitation Ca2+ sensor, regulates SV release. In particular, we will test if Syt7 negatively
regulates release by inhibiting fusogenicity of SVs in the reserve pool and activating Ca2+-dependent recycling routes that decrease SV replenishment rate at AZs. In Aim 3, we will
analyze how the Syt4 Ca2+ sensor interfaces with postsynaptic SNAREs to mediate retrograde
signaling and control synaptic plasticity. In addition, we will identify new components of
retrograde signaling using genetic screens to assay for defects in postsynaptic membrane
trafficking. In Aim 4, we will perform localization studies and functional analysis of the final four
members of the Drosophila Syt family to test their putative roles in DCV fusion and neuropeptide
release (Syt-α and Syt-β) or Ca2+-independent regulation of membrane trafficking (Syt12 and
Syt14). Using CRISPR technology to mutate and endogenously tag these Syt members, we are
in an exciting position to define the function of the entire Syt family within a single organism for
the first time. In summary, these experiments will provide a comprehensive picture of how the
Synaptotagmin family of proteins control synaptic membrane trafficking to regulate Ca2+-dependent neuronal communication from multiple intracellular compartments."
10843899,"SUMMARY
Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common vascular malformations and the leading
cause of hemorrhagic strokes. Past studies have demonstrated an important role of endothelial cells (ECs) in
cerebral AVMs, and shown that the maintenance of endothelial integrity by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
and Notch signaling is critical for cerebral vascular formation. However, it is unclear how disturbed crosstalk
between BMP and Notch signaling affects EC differentiation at transcriptional regulatory level causing cerebral
AVMs. In this proposal, we aim to unearth that the crosstalk between BMP and Notch signaling induces histone
deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to shift the transcriptional landscape of ECs toward ill-fated differentiation causing
cerebral AVMs. We will also define if HDAC2 inhibition prevents this ill-fated cell shift and improves cerebral
AVMs. In preliminary study, using a new mouse model, we find a striking shift of ECs to mesenchymal-like cells
in cerebral AVMs and show that these mesenchymal-like cells cause arteriovenous shunts. Utilizing single-cell
RNA sequencing and connectivity Map, we identify HDAC inhibition to prevent ECs from mesenchymal cell
differentiation and significantly reduce cerebral AVMs. In human and mouse cerebral AVMs, we find a specific
HDAC2 induction. We show that HDAC2 induction alters specific histone modifications, which are responsible
for the shift of ECs to mesenchymal cell differentiation. Endothelial-specific deletion of HDAC2 prevents this ill-
fated cell shift and reduces cerebral AVMs. Similar results of dysregulated HDAC2 with its downstream effects
are also found in cerebral AVMs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) and type 2 (HHT2), but
not in juvenile polyposis/HHT. Furthermore, we find that HDAC2 is specifically induced in cerebral AVMs by
excess BMP through delta-like protein 3 (Dll3) and Notch1 signaling. We uncover that lack of matrix Gla protein
(MGP) allows BMP-8b to elevate staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), which is required
for Notch signaling to induce HDAC2 in cerebral AVMs. We hypothesize that HDAC2 induction, downstream of
excess BMP and Notch signaling, alters specific histone modifications to shift ECs toward ill-fated differentiation
causing cerebral AVMs. In specific Aim 1, we will determine how HDAC2 is dysregulated by the crosstalk
between BMP and Notch signaling and shifts endothelial differentiation in cerebral AVMs. In specific Aim 2, we
will determine the contribution of HDAC2 induction to human cerebral AVMs. In specific Aim 3, we will determine
if limiting HDAC2 improves cerebral AVMs. If successful, the obtained information will provide new insight into
the mechanism of AVMs, and HDAC2 inhibition may emerge as a novel therapeutic approach for cerebral AVMs."

translational biological and behavioral approaches to identify objective, quantifiable biomarkers to improve
mechanistic understanding and advance treatment discovery. To achieve this goal, the candidate proposes a
focused training program with an exceptional team of scientific advisors to develop her skills and knowledge in
the areas of: 1) paradigm optimization and translational research, 2) advanced electrophysiology analysis and

(Dr. Sweeney) and co-mentor (Dr. Erickson) are co-project PIs on the U54 FXS Center, providing the
candidate with necessary resources, recruitment pool, and scientific excellence to complete her proposed
training program and research plan. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and

biomarkers of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS. Yet, electrophysiology studies of neurocognitive alterations is a
remarkably under-studied area despite the devastating impact these behavioral features have on individuals
with FXS and their families. The candidate proposes to use performance-based EEG to investigate the
neurophysiological basis of speech production and behavioral flexibility issues—among the most functionally
disabling behavioral features of FXS. The proposed research plan will consist of two phases. In Phase I, 15
adults with Fragile X Syndrome and 15 age-, sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls will complete
testing in which key aspects of tasks will be parametrically varied to identify optimal testing conditions. In
Phase II, 25 adults with FXS, 25 age-, and IQ-matched developmental delayed (DD) controls, and 25 matched
TDC will complete testing using paradigms optimized in Phase I. To identify neural abnormalities during
speech production and behavioral flexibility, event-related potentials (ERPs), phase and amplitude coupling
and coherence, and gamma single-trial power (STP) in fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal regions,
respectively, will be examined. Findings from the proposed studies will provide critical insight into our
mechanistic understanding of FXS and assist in treatment discovery and establishment of biomarker
identification/validation."
10848393,"PROTEOMICS CORE - Summary
 The mission of the Vermont Genetics Network (VGN) Proteomics Core is to provide high-quality, timely,
and affordable service to network clients for state-or-the-art proteomic analyses. Previously, Vermonters had to
use mass spectrometry facilities outside of the state, often at high prices and with low priority service. The VGN
Core has changed that. In addition to supporting faculty research, the Core also supports the outreach,
education, and training of students in the development of contemporary proteomics skills that will prepare them
for graduate-level research training or entry into the biomedical workforce.
 Since 2006, the Core has been providing mass spectrometry expertise and services to the research
community. The staff consults with investigators during experimental design, assists with sample preparation,
and provides data (in collaboration with Bioinformatics Core staff) so that network investigators can collect and
use the data in publications and be competitive for extramural funding. The Core also provides unique
educational outreach opportunities to students through the integration of the proteomics course module into
classes and use of proteomics in their VGN-funded research. The component is innovative in that students have
hands-on experience with the state-of-the-art proteomics technologies and learn to interpret proteomics data
derived from their samples analyzed by the Core.
 The major aims of the Core are: Provide high quality and timely proteomics services to network faculty
and students; establish new proteomics methodologies for the benefit of the network and other clients; sustain
the Core by refining its operating procedures; and work with the Administrative Core to assess Core operations."
11059507,"In this Research Opportunity Announcement for Area of Interest 4, we describe the seminal work of establishing an infrastructure that operationalizes engagement of diverse research participants, distinct from recruitment/enrollment, and building on the foundational work of integrating research participants within the governance of research programs. Our approach and best practices are embedded into the Engagement Core’s five aims 1)Serve as the central hub for participant engagement – providing resources, expertise, and tools – to the All of Us Consortium for engaging participants as partners in the governance, priority setting, implementation, and evaluation of All of Us; 2) Effectively integrate participants, who reflect the broad diversity of All of Us, as partners in the governance, oversight, and evaluation of All of Us; 3) Capture and integrate the voices of diverse participants to enhance the design, implementation, and use of All of Us data, resources, and results; 4) Continuously assess the impact of participant engagement on all aspects and phases of All of Us including governance, design, implementation, and evaluation; and 5) Advance the science of engagement with an emphasis on engaging historically marginalized and minoritized groups. To date, our Engagement Core has established the infrastructure for participant engagement, by successfully integrating 81 participants (including 58 [72%] from minoritized and historically excluded communities into various All of Us governance roles including 12 members on the steering committee and 6 on the executive committee. Our Engagement Core has responded to 55 requests for engagement reflecting a range of activities including review of a mental health and well-being PPI survey and generating potential solutions to safely extend data access to non-traditional researchers in the All of Us Researcher Workbench. In the next phase, we will continue the multi-faceted strategies above and will expand our approaches to include voices currently missing from existing engagement such as young adults, and parents of children aged 18 and younger (critical given upcoming pediatric enrollment). We will also create new mechanisms such as a rapid feedback panels - a diverse group of participants who will provide time-sensitive feedback in critical areas. Ultimately, we will document successful strategies to contribute evidence-based recommendations for future large-scale studies with a substantial participant engagement component."
10909181,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hormonal therapies have been revolutionary in the treatment of women with estrogen receptor positive
(ER+) breast cancers, greatly enhancing survival. ER-targeted hormonal therapies include selective
estrogen receptor modulators SERMs, such as tamoxifen, and selective estrogen receptor downregulators
(SERDs), such as fulvestrant, whereas aromatase inhibitors block the biosynthesis of estrogen. These
therapies have significant side effects, and their prolonged use can lead to chemoresistance in about one-
third of treated women, often resulting in more aggressive cancers. Furthermore, tamoxifen use is
associated with increased incidence of endometrial thickening and hyperplasia, polyps and cancer. Recent
studies have identified novel pathways involving the 7-transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptor
GPER in patients undergoing SERM/SERD therapies. Cross-reactive pharmacological agonism of GPER
contributes to both hormonal resistance and off-target effects in the uterus as all clinically approved anti-
estrogens act as agonists for GPER and stimulate these pathways. This critical issue of ER/GPER
selectivity has not been addressed in the development of SERM and SERD drugs. In our previous work, we
discovered and characterized novel selective ligands for GPER that do not bind ERα or ERβ.Recently, we
discovered a novel small molecule that for the very first-time targets ER without interference of GPER.
 As current anti-estrogens do not discriminate between ERα/β and GPER, our newly identified small
molecule affords the opportunity to create novel ligands and therapeutic agents to selectively target ERα.
Through chemical modifications to this first-generation ERα-selective compound, we have improved the
affinity, receptor-selectivity and antagonist/agonist profile with the ultimate goal of creating truly ERα-
selective antagonists. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Synthesize and resolve the bioactive
enantiomer of optimized ERα-targeted AB-SERD compounds with GPER anti-selectivity; 2. Prioritize
compounds through in vitro methods including receptor binding, cell signaling, proliferation and toxicity and
3. Determine in vivo anti-tumor and ADMET properties of lead compounds, employing ER-dependent and
anti-hormone-resistant transgenic, xenograft and PDX tumors.
 The successful completion of these studies will identify innovative enantiospecific compounds as
unique pharmacological tools for delineating the individual functions of ER and GPER, and also initiating the
development of first-in-class therapeutic agents, with the goal of reducing anti-hormone resistant recurrence
of breast cancer, enhancing survival and the quality of life for the greater than 200,000 women annually
diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancer."
10845820,"Project Summary
With aging, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in the bone marrow (BM) accumulate somatic
mutations that may confer a proliferative advantage to the mutant cell; this enhanced clonal expansion gives rise
to mutant progeny cells which (i) comprise an outsized fraction of leukocytes in the peripheral blood and tissues
and (ii) typically have increased proinflammatory activity relative to normal leukocytes. In individuals with no
overt hematological malignancy, this age-related acquisition of somatic mutations that confer HSPC clonal
expansion advantage is designated clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CHIP affects >10%
of individuals older than 65 and predominantly involves genes encoding epigenetic regulators, such as, DNMT3A
(DNA methyltransferase 3A), which is the most commonly mutated gene in CHIP. CHIP has thus far been
conclusively linked with increased risk of hematologic malignancies and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
We hypothesized that the generation in the BM and release in the circulation of CHIP-mutant leukocytes may
contribute to increased inflammatory destruction in tissues where they are recruited, such as the inflamed
periodontium. Our overall objective is to show that DNMT3A-driven CHIP increases the severity of periodontal
disease and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our hypothesis will be addressed in preclinical models
of CHIP and ligature-induced periodontitis in mice. CHIP will be modelled with Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPC derived from
mice that harbor a mutation (R878H) that is equivalent to the human hotspot heterozygous mutation (R882H),
which causes a dominant negative loss of DNMT3A methylation activity. The experimental system involves
competitive BM transplantation with clinically relevant 10% CHIP-mutant cells (Dnmt3aR878H/+ CD45.2+ cells) and
90% wild-type CD45.1+ cells in CD45.1 recipient mice. Control CD45.1 recipient mice will be transplanted with
10% Dnmt3a+/+ CD45.2+ cells and 90% wild-type CD45.1+ cells, i.e., exclusively normal BM cells. In Specific Aim
1, we will investigate whether the expansion of Dnmt3a mutant clones is associated with exacerbation of
periodontal disease (‘to establish PHENOTYPE’). In Specific Aim 2, our objective is to establish a mechanistic
basis that can link DNMT3A-driven CHIP and periodontal disease (‘to establish MECHANISM’). In Specific Aim
3, we explore intervention approaches to block the expansion of Dnmt3a mutant clones and their impact on
periodontal disease (‘to develop THERAPY’). Our project can potentially implicate CHIP as a causal link between
aging and periodontal disease. If the hypothesis is confirmed and the proposed treatment is successful,
screening of the elderly for CHIP may identify individuals with increased risk for periodontal disease. Such
patients may benefit from preventive treatments aiming to block the aberrant expansion of CHIP mutant clones
and their harmful impact on periodontal disease (as well as on comorbidities that are also exacerbated by CHIP,
such as cardiovascular disease)."
10848564,"SUMMARY: Primary Cells, Tissues, and Animals Core (Core B) is responsible for providing investigators of the
Program Project (PPG) with animal models, tissues, and primary cells necessary to achieve their specific aims.
Experiments of this PPG focus on identifying mechanisms responsible for the differences in longevity and
Alzheimer’s disease susceptibility between species of mammals. Mammals offer a unique opportunity for
comparative studies of longevity because of the over 100-fold differences in lifespans between species. For
example, short-lived mammals, such as shrews, live a maximum 2 years, while long-lived mammals, such as
Bowhead whales have maximum lifespans over 200 years. To enable the study of molecular mechanisms of
longevity in these animals, it is essential to provide access to biological materials from multiple mammalian
species. Core B maintains and replenishes, as needed, the collection of tissues and primary cells from 58 species
of mammals. The Core provides project investigators with tissues, cells, DNA and RNA. In addition, Core B
maintains aging colonies of mice, naked mole rats, Damaraland mole rat, degu, and African spiny mice for the
use by project investigators and will perform stress treatments on these animals as required for the projects.
Core B will monitor and identify degus with cognitive impairment as part of pre-screening them for molecular
studies of Alzheimer’s disease pathology by the Projects. Considering the effort needed to collect and establish
cell cultures from non-standard organisms that are not commercially available, this centralized resource saves
time and effort, and reduces costs. Core B will also maintain and breed mouse models with interventions
engineered based on the longevity mechanisms discovered by project investigators in long-lived mammalian
species. This includes mice overexpressing human, beaver, and Bowhead whale versions of SIRT6, bowhead
whale CIRBP, naked mole rat hyaluronan synthase 2 gene (nmrHAS2 mice), and mice treated with
hyaluronidase inhibitors or inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes. These mouse models will also be bred to
Alzheimer's disease mouse models MAPT and 5xFAD. Core B will perform longevity studies with these mice
and analyze the effect of interventions on health and Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Maintaining the centralized
collection standardizes culture conditions, quality control and biological samples for use across PPG projects,
improves reproducibility of results, and allows analysis of the same individual animals by several assays and
projects to minimize animal use."
10848565,"SUMMARY: In this Program Project, the bioinformatics core (Core C) will continue to provide computational
support. Core C will help process and analyze the large amount of data that will be generated by the four
projects. We propose a comparative study of genome maintenance and Alzheimer’s disease in relation to
longevity in mammals. While it has long been observed that mammals differ enormously in their lifespans, the
mechanisms behind this difference remain unclear. Lack of this information is an important problem, because,
without this knowledge, acquiring the ability to modulate aging on the whole organism level is highly unlikely.
Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that determine longevity and susceptibility to Alzheimer’s
disease. The overall objective of the bioinformatics core is to provide computational support and service to the
project investigators – namely, both to work with each project to handle the data generated therein and to
integrate data from all projects to achieve the aims of the program project grant as a whole. The central
hypothesis of this Program Project is that long-lived mammals have evolved specific molecular mechanisms
that mediate their longevity. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in
the applicants' laboratories. The rationale for a dedicated bioinformatics core is that a consolidated facility is
needed to manage the large amount of data on the whole genome level generated by each of the four highly
integrated projects of this program project. This bioinformatics core will achieve two specific aims: 1) To assist
the four research projects with data processing and analysis and develop new, dedicated tools to be used by
PPG investigators; 2) To generate a high-quality bowhead whale genome assembly and annotation for this
Project and as a resource for the research community; and 3) To maintain and further develop the PPG
website, launch Degu Resource website to provide the community with novel Alzheimer’s disease model and
develop a high-speed data portal for internal and public data sharing. The function of the bioinformatics core is
significant, because it will be set up to meet the challenge posed by the high volume of data that needs to be
generated, examined at multiple levels by a variety of approaches, and integrated to develop the models of
lifespan control, and shared among project investigators."
10848566,"Summary: Long-lived species evolved efficient mechanisms of genome and epigenome maintenance, which
can be adapted to extend human lifespan and healthspan. Furthermore, genomic instability has been implicated
in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Related Dementias (ADRD). Investigating long-lived species provides us with
an unparallelled opportunity to discover novel longevity adaptations perfected over millions of years of evolution.
In the current period of support, we made several discoveries that shed light onto the mechanisms responsible
for more efficient genome and epigenome maintenance in long-lived mammals. We demonstrated that DNA
double-strand break (DSB) repair strongly correlates with species maximum lifespan. We showed that SIRT6 is
responsible for the major part of this correlation. We demonstrated that a SIRT6 variant with enhanced mono-
ADP-ribosylation activity is enriched in human centenarians. We demonstrated that somatic mutation rates
inversely correlate with maximum lifespan of species. We found that transposable elements become
derepressed with age and contribute to inflammation and epigenetic drift. Finally, we developed transcriptomic
signatures of short- and long-lived species and demonstrated DNA DSB repair genes are more highly expressed
in long-lived species, while inflammation and cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathways are dampened in long-lived
species. We discovered that the longest-lived mammal, the bowhead whale, has extremely efficient and accurate
DNA DSB repair, mediated by high levels of cold-induced RNA binding protein (CIRBP). Our unpublished data
demonstrates that several bat species have highly efficient DNA DSB repair mediated by yet unknown
mechanisms. We also obtained preliminary data that long-lived species have a more stable epigenome when
subjected to DNA damage and identified combinatorial histone modifications (PTMs) that correlate with longevity.
These findings put us in an excellent position to identify the fundamental mechanisms of longevity and develop
antiaging interventions based on targeting these newly identified pathways. Our aims are: (1) Understand
epigenetic determinants of longevity. We will identify genes controlled by longevity-associated PTMs, identify
reader and writer enzymes and test whether these PTMs can be manipulated to extend lifespan; (2) Understand
the mechanisms of genome and epigenome stability in long-lived species; we will identify proteins that promote
more efficient DNA repair in long-lived species and identify DNA and RNA modifications associated with longer
lifespan using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry approaches; (3) Test whether interventions targeting longevity
adaptations, i.e. SIRT6, CIRBP and cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathways improve genome and epigenome
stability, delay AD onset, and increase lifespan in mice. We will collaborate with Project 2 to test the relationship
between genome stability and AD, with Project 3 to measure mutation rates and with Project 4 to test the effects
of interventions on aging clocks. The innovative approaches we propose in this PPG will provide answers to key
questions in the field that could not be answered using traditional approaches or in a single investigator study."
10848567,"Summary: Despite enormous resources being committed to study Alzheimer’s disease (AD) there is no effective
treatment or cure. One of the difficulties in developing treatments is the lack of animal models that recapitulate
human sporadic disease. The goal of this project is to apply the power of comparative biology to develop novel
approaches and animal models for AD. We will focus on two rodent species, the naked mole rat (NMR) and
Octodon degus (degu) that represent high resistance to AD (NMR) and susceptibility to sporadic onset AD
(degu). We expect that these novel approaches will uncover new mechanisms of AD and AD resistance and
provide the community with animal models and datasets for future research. In the current funding cycle, we
made significant progress in understanding mechanisms of naked mole rat longevity. We demonstrated that
NMRs are resistant to osteoarthritis and do not undergo thymic involution. We built epigenetic clocks for NMRs
and showed that NMR queens age more slowly. We built a single cell atlas of the NMR hematopoietic system
and identified multiple neotenic traits. We previously discovered that naked mole rats have very high levels of
high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) in their tissues. Excitingly, we now show that mice expressing
naked mole rat hyaluronan synthase 2 gene (nmrHAS2) have longer lifespan and healthspan and are protected
from inflammation. Funded by an administrative supplement, we expanded our research into the field of AD. Our
preliminary data suggest that the nmrHAS2 transgene also protects mice from AD. We also established a colony
of degu, a rodent that spontaneously develops AD-like pathology, and discovered that degus are naturally
deficient in methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) function, which protects methionines from oxidation. This
result suggests a novel mechanism for sporadic AD: we hypothesize that in sporadic AD low MSR activity
leads to increased methionine oxidation which accelerates the formation of protein aggregates. Project
2 will ask the following questions: What is the mechanism of AD resistance in the NMR? Does elevating HMW-
HA, genetically or pharmacologically, protect from AD and how? What is the mechanism of sporadic AD in degu?
Does MSR deficiency lead to AD in degu, mouse, and human? Our aims are: (1) To uncover novel mechanisms
of AD resistance in the NMR. We will perform transcriptome and proteome comparisons between mouse, NMR,
and a short-lived NMR relative, Damaraland mole rat (DMR). We will further investigate the role of HMW-HA in
protecting from AD and test whether pharmacological agents that increase HA protect from AD. (2) We will
develop degu as a model for AD. We will develop behavioral tests for degu and perform molecular
characterization of degu brains and peripheral tissues. We will examine the role of MSR in AD pathology in degu,
mouse models of MSR deficiency, and in human brains and induced neurons from AD patients. With Projects 1
and 3 we will examine mutation rates and epigenome stability in NMR, degu and mouse brains, and with Project
4 analyze aging and AD clocks."

10849361,"ABSTRACT
Precision Medicine (PM) is revolutionizing the care of patients by tailoring treatment options based on the
molecular composition of their disease. To secure the necessary molecular information, liquid biopsies represent
an exciting source of molecular markers because of the minimally invasive nature of securing them, the plethora
of marker types (circulating biological cells, cell-free molecules [proteins, micro-RNA, cell-free DNA] and
extracellular vesicles [exosomes]), and the diverse molecular information they carry. The challenge with the use
of these exciting markers is that the disease-associated liquid biopsy markers can be a vast minority in a mixed
population making it difficult to secure high-quality results. This is partly due to a lack of platforms for their efficient
isolation and tools to analyze the limited numbers of diseased molecules contained in a liquid biopsy isolate. The
use of microfluidics has become a valuable platform technology to generate high quality isolates that can be fed
into molecular analysis technologies such as NGS to secure results to guide treatment decisions in the clinic
(i.e., translational research) as well as driving basic discoveries. The KIPM COBRE’s Biomedical Engineering
Core (BME Core) is a unique Core within the medical enterprise and consists of two units: (i) Plastics Engineering
Unit (PEU); and (ii) Liquid Biopsy Unit (LBU). The PEU has enabling infrastructure built during the Phase 1
funding of KIPM including a state-of-the-art cleanroom with patterning equipment possessing the ability to
generate both microstructures and nanostructures and production equipment to support large-scale clinical
studies associated with KIPM’s RPLs and outside users. The LBU uses microfluidic devices emanating from the
PEU that possess unprecedented figures-of-merit to analyze liquid biopsy markers. The LBU also has liquid
handling robots to automate the microfluidic workflow. Both units operated collaboratively to support the Phase
1 junior faculty projects as well as many external projects from the KU community and nationally. The activities
of the BME Core and their unique hardware and molecular assays are enabled by collaborations with a P41 NIH
National Biotechnology Resource Center, directed by the mPI of KIPM (Soper), and whose mission is to deliver
innovative technologies into the biomedical community. In the KIPM Phase 2, the BME Core will seek to add
new resource capabilities to both units support the RPLs to facilitate their securing funding from different federal
agencies. These capabilities include nanopatterning to generate new innovative tools and assays for the analysis
of a variety of molecular types, the efficient isolation of cell free DNA to support NGS studies by the RPLs using
a unique microfluidic device, and a highly innovative single-molecule sequencing strategy. The BME Core will
strive to develop business models to sustain long-term operation, increase visibility to recruit external users, and
maintain a seasoned staff. Long term operation of the LBU will be facilitated by partnerships with the private
sector to supply tools to the unit. Dissemination of new discoveries will be facilitated through a robust website,
meeting participation, and timely publications."
10849021,"TISSUE CULTURE & BIOBANKING SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Tissue Culture & Biobanking Shared Resource (TCBSR) is an integral part of Georgetown Lombardi
Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) research activities and has been funded by the Cancer Center Support
Grant (CCSG) since 1993. Bassem R. Haddad, MD, has led the TCBSR as Director since 2002. The TCBSR
provides services to support LCCC Members with all tissue culture-related aspects of their work. It also offers
unique and necessary services that enable biobanking of blood and other biofluid specimens obtained from
subjects enrolled in various LCCC studies. The tissue culture services available are as follows: (1) cell culture
and cell banking; (2) conditional reprogramming of cells to establish primary epithelial cell cultures from normal
and cancer tissues; (3) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) B-cell transformation service to facilitate cancer genetics
studies; (4) maintaining the LCCC repository of established cell lines; (5) performing quality control tests for cell
lines, including cell line authentication and mycoplasma testing services; (6) providing a safe and secure
cryostorage facility for investigators to keep frozen stocks of their cancer cell lines and other reagents; (7) testing
and supplying tissue culture reagents of the highest quality that have been tested for suitability in the relevant
systems, as inexpensively as possible; (8) equipping, monitoring and stocking three separate shared tissue
culture laboratories for use by LCCC investigators; and (9) training in the basic principles of tissue culture with
hands-on experience. The TCBSR is also responsible for biobanking blood and other biofluid specimens
obtained from subjects enrolled in various LCCC studies by the Survey, Recruitment, & Biospecimen Collection
Shared Resource (SRBSR) and individual LCCC Members. The biobanking services include the processing of
specimens (e.g., preparing aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
[PBMCs]), banking the specimens, and disbursing as needed. The TCBSR continues to be heavily used by a
large number of LCCC Members conducting basic science research, translational research, as well as for some
clinical trials (biobanking). In FY2022, the TCBSR provided services to 38 LCCC Members from all three
Research Programs: 18 from the Cancer Cell Biology Program, 14 from Cancer Host Interactions Program, and
6 from Cancer Prevention and Control Program. Collaboration between TCBSR and seven other LCCC Shared
Resources is an active process, particularly in biobanking where TCBSR works synergistically with the SRBSR
to enable the biobanking of all blood and other biofluid specimens obtained from subjects enrolled by SRBSR in
various LCCC studies. The capabilities of the TCBSR also provided key tissue culture and biobanking support
that enabled the success of 68 extramurally funded research project grants, 8 clinical trials, and 60 peer-reviewed
publications, including 18 published in high-impact journals (e.g. Nucleic Acid Res, Nat Commun, Cancer Res,
J Immunother Cancer, Cancer Immunol Res, and Oncogene) during the current project period."
10849022,"SURVEY, RECRUITMENT & BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Survey, Recruitment & Biospecimen
Collection Shared Resource (SRBSR) was established in July 2011 and has been CCSG supported since May
2014. The SRBSR is co-led by an oncology clinical research nurse administrator, Colleen McGuire RN, MSN,
and a health services researcher, Arnold Potosky, PhD, MHS. The SRBSR provides LCCC Members with a
comprehensive suite of services designed to meet their research needs, from consultative services prior to study
initiation through survey development and implementation, database programming and preparation, subject
recruitment and tracking, biospecimen acquisition, and data entry and data management. The SRBSR maintains
and continuously updates a centralized, unified, and efficient patient registry (Georgetown MedStar Research
Registry [GMR2]) and the Familial Cancer Registry (FCR) to facilitate subject recruitment and biospecimen
acquisition for LCCC patients. Most (97%) subjects currently enrolled in this patient registry have consented to
have their samples retained for future studies and to be contacted about future studies for which they may be
eligible (96%). The SRBSR serves the needs of investigators from various disciplines, including behavioral
scientists, clinical and translational researchers, epidemiologists, and basic scientists. The SRBSR receives
input from the SRBSR Advisory Committee (AC) annually. In response to the prior critique to obtain more user
feedback and to facilitate navigation of the SR, the SRBSR implemented three additional user surveys to
prioritize development and assess programmatic needs, redesigned the SR webpage, and created an online
request form to enhance navigation by prospective users. With respect to use, the SRBSR has enrolled 3,806
subjects into 19 studies in the current project period, including 5 clinical trials. During this time, the SRBSR
collected 844 liquid and 64 tissue biospecimens. To ensure synergy with other Shared Resources, the SRBSR
works closely with the Histopathology & Tissue Shared Resource and the Tissue Culture & Biobanking Shared
Resource, which process and store the biospecimens. The SRBSR assists investigators in designing and
implementing surveys based on robust and reliable data collection platforms. The SRBSR also validates, tracks
and cleans datasets for analysis. The SRBSR has provided support for all three LCCC Research Programs. In
FY2022, the SRBSR provided services to 24 LCCC Members across all three Research Programs (3 Cancer

10857944,"ABSTRACT
 RhoA, a member of the Rho-family of small GTPases, centrally regulates actin organization and
actomyosin contractility. RhoA dynamics coordinate actin stress fiber formation, which ultimately determines how
cells generate cytoskeletal tension to transmit mechanical forces to/from neighboring cell-cell junctions and focal
adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Thus, new tools to control the dynamics of RhoA signaling may
enhance understanding of how cells make decisions in response to mechanical stimuli. We propose to create
optogenetic tools for bi-directional (activation and inactivation) control over RhoA signaling, systematically
characterize their function through a set of physiological assays in contractility and mechanotransduction, and
benchmark their performance against other reported optogenetic technologies. We will use our recently
discovered BcLOV4 photoreceptor that dynamically translocates via a direct light-induced protein-lipid interaction
with the plasma membrane, making it powerful for single-component optogenetic control over peripheral
membrane proteins that is robust across cell types and primary cells. To demonstrate the unique capabilities of
the toolbox, we will quantitatively map the cytoskeletal signaling and tensional dynamics of a known RhoA/YAP
mechanotransductive feedback loop in cytoskeletal remodeling and persistent cell motility, through simultaneous
optogenetic perturbation and multi-reporter imaging. This toolbox will broadly impact cell and cytoskeletal biology
by advancing control over ubiquitous RhoA signaling to probe its diverse regulatory roles in cell contractility,
motility, mechanotransduction, and regeneration."

Vanderbilt University is requesting funds for an Agilent Seahorse XF Pro Analyzer. The Seahorse Analyzer
allows the non-invasive real-time study of cellular bioenergetics in adherent or suspension cells, permeabilized
cells, ex vivo tissue, isolated mitochondria, organoids, or whole organisms. A previous S10-funded Seahorse
XFe96 is housed and operated in the Vanderbilt High-throughput Screening (VHTS) Facility for the past 9 years.
Current use of the instrument over the past 5 years has averaged- 450 annual hours and ~40 users from 30
funded projects. A very broad spectrum of fields of research have used the instrument, including investigators
from 40 different departments at Vanderbilt University and Medical Center. The major areas of interest include
numerous disease states in which metabolic dysfunction has been implicated, such as cancer, obesity,
immunology, cardiology, and neurodegenerative disorders. The instrument use has resulted in 33 publications,
to date. Clearly the need for continuing these bioenergetic studies at Vanderbilt is critical to many areas of
biomedical research. Although the XFe96 Analyzer has been an outstanding instrument, it is past its life
expectancy, and critical components have had to be replaced in the past few years, including the main computer
board. Thus, it is crucial that this instrument is replaced as soon as possible to avoid delays or halting of NIH-
funded projects that aim to advancing their bioenergetics studies in basic or early translational research. The
proposed upgrade will be the newest Agilent Seahorse Analyzer model, the XF Pro. This model significantly
improves the sensitivity, temperature control, reduces plate and sample variability, and has upgraded software
to better integrate plate annotations, data normalization, analyses, and multiplexed assays. The XF Pro will be
integrated for automated cell normalization through an accompanying plate imaging system to provide seamless
workflows and quick, robust data analyses. The upgraded Seahorse Analyzer will continue to enhance current
and future research in bioenergetics at Vanderbilt."
10912068,"The cell cortex underlies essential cellular functions, including cell shape changes that facilitate cell division. Comprised of a meshwork of filamentous actin (F-actin) and the plasma membrane, the cortex is remodeled during cytokinesis, physically dividing the cell in two. Recent work has shown that prior to large-scale remodeling, the cortex is also dynamically patterned with coherent subcellular waves of the small GTPase RhoA and F-actin, a phenomenon termed “cortical excitability”. In developing embryos, these waves appear over the entire surface of the cell and then feed into the cytokinetic furrow as cell division progresses and have been proposed to support the rapid and flexible establishment of the division plane. Investigating the mechanisms that support and regulate cortical patterning is currently limited by a lack of technical approaches that can bridge our understanding of biochemical feedback signaling and cortical pattern formation, including the molecular regulation of signaling molecules, membrane dynamics, and cytoskeletal remodeling. A breakthrough in this gap in knowledge has been the development by the applicant of an “artificial cortex”, made from supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and Xenopus egg extract, which successfully reconstitutes active Rho and F-actin dynamics in a cell-free system. Like in vivo cortical excitability, patterning in the artificial cortex depends on Rho activity and F-actin polymerization. This novel, synthetic approach to investigating cortical patterning is an ideal system for systematically examining the role of individual factors (such as upstream GTPase regulators, membrane composition and fluidity, cell cycle state) in regulating cortical dynamics. Using the artificial cortex as a model for cortical patterning, this proposal for a MOSAIC K99/R00 Award seeks to understand how cortical pattern formation is regulated and how patterning remodels the cell cortex to perform essential functions like cytokinesis. Dr. Landino will investigate the factors that drive cortical wave formation (Aim 1), cytoskeletal remodeling at the cortex (Aim 2), and the role of cortical patterning in supporting successful cell division (Aim 3). The results of this work will expand our knowledge of the molecular regulation of the cortex underlying the emergence of cortical excitability, and the role of dynamic patterning in cell division. Dr. Landino's long-term career goal is to establish an independent research group investigating the mechanisms that regulate cortical patterning and cell division. The proposed training will provide Dr. Landino with additional scientific expertise, including technical training in electron microscopy and preparation of cycling extract, and further establish the artificial cortex as a useful platform for understanding the biochemical and structural regulation of the cell cortex. This award will further Dr. Landino's professional development including formal training in research laboratory management, leading a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace, and a tailored plan to support Dr. Landino's application to faculty positions. The exemplary scientific and professional environment at the University of Michigan is ideally suited to support the training outlined in this proposal and ensure Dr. Landino's success in launching an independent research program."
10862783,"Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) have intergenerational negative impacts on the physical 
and mental health of women and their families and are the most frequently experienced childbirth 
complication. PMADs are particularly common in rural populations, who experience additional obstacles in 
accessing maternal and child health (MCH) and mental health services. Doulas, non-medically trained 
childbirth and postpartum companions, have been proposed as one way to address existing healthcare 
gaps, and as a way to improve mental health outcomes, along with additional MCH outcomes such as 
decreased substance use, increased prenatal and postpartum healthcare visit attendance, and 
improvements in overall maternal physical wellbeing. The aims of this research are: 1) Explore the use of 
doulas to improve self-efficacy and maternal mental health outcomes for rural populations; 2) Develop a 
doula intervention to improve self-efficacy and maternal mental health in rural populations; and 3) Pilot a 
doula-led intervention to improve self-efficacy and maternal mental health outcomes. Using the NIM....'s 
experimental therapeutics approach, I will explore the underlying mechanism impacting these outcomes 
by focusing on how doulas improve self-efficacy among their clients. Following Whitbeck's (2006) model 
for adaptation of interventions, and community-based participatory research (CBPR) best practices, I will 
use formative and exploratory research approaches to address knowledge gaps about the use of doulas 
to improve PMADs and secondary maternal and infant health outcomes. Through this project we will first 
collect primary qualitative data regarding the feasibility of using doulas to improve PMAD health outcomes 
and will identify the needs and barriers in accessing mental health care, as well as social and emotional 
support that could be addressed by doulas (N=40). The proposed research will then synthesize 
quantitative data on the use of doulas and peer-support models with qualitative data collected from 
semi-structured interviews to develop and test a doula-led intervention through adapting an existing 
doula-training. A mixed-methods approach will be used to analyze findings from study participants (N=75) 
and doulas and providers (N=20). This project will provide preliminary data for the cultural adaptation of 
the intervention for use with other marginalized groups and rural populations, including Indigenous 
communities, who experience heightened PMADs and other negative MCH outcomes."
10861834,"Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-
Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental
health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and
immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The
National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the
mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76
Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research
training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver
skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce
stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of
themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes
to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver
symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often
already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.
 In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD
caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either
include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery
Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative
mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness
skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for
caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.
 The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without
MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to
develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the
hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported
insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine
learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of
AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of
aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral
markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes."
10861835,"Mechanisms of Endogenous DNA Damage Promotion
Identification of the oncogenic mechanisms underlying cancer-promoting mutations remains a critical bottleneck
in translation of discovered cancer-gene identities into effective anti-cancer strategies. Furthermore, strong
correlations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with cancers indicate that these mechanisms also underlie AD. Their
identification may allow fundamentally new AD pre-disease biomarkers, diagnostic, preventative and possibly
therapeutic strategies. The goal of this multi-PI project is to leverage the team’s discovery in Escherichia coli,
and its immediate translation to human homologs, of large, diverse, conserved networks of proteins that promote
endogenous DNA damage and genome instability when overproduced—the DNA “Damage-up” Proteins (DDPs).
DDP identities and mechanisms discovered indicate that many known and unknown overproduced oncoproteins
are likely to constitute oncogenic and AD-associated mechanisms in which pathologies arise from destabilization
of genomes rather than via the proteins’ other specific cell-biological functions. A network of E. coli DDPs
promote endogenous DNA damage and mutation when overproduced, modeling many overproduction
oncoproteins. The human homologs are highly enriched among known cancer driving genes, and their RNAs in
cancers predict heavy tumor mutation loads and poor patient outcomes. 46% of human homologs sampled
promote DNA damage and mutagenesis when overproduced in human cells, demonstrating the power of the E.
coli platform for predicting human functions. Unlike genome instability and cancer caused by DNA-repair gene
loss-of-function mutations, DDPs promote genome instability as gain-of-function alterations (overproduction),
and so potentially can be drugged. DDPs defy previous cancer-gene/protein functional classes because they
destabilize genomes but are not DNA-repair genes that suppress mutation rate, but instead are instigators of
endogenous DNA damage and genome instability via mechanisms previously poorly defined. This project is
aimed at revealing fundamental conserved mechanisms and consequences of endogenous DNA-damage
promotion by DDPs using the E. coli model to guide cancer-protein function discovery in human cells. Because
the DDPs and their activites are a new and innovative conceptual paradigm, we expect results of this project to
re-direct many ongoing efforts in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Because vast numbers and kinds
of proteins are implicated, and cancer is strongly correlated with AD, increased endogenous DNA damage may
be a widespread biomarker for cancer and AD susceptibility."
10861836,"Project Summary
Currently, 2.2 million individuals are incarcerated in the United States (US), and approximately
600,000 are released annually. Substance use disorders (SUDs) are common in this population:
~65% meet the criteria for an SUD diagnosis (vs 5% of the general population). Post-
incarceration, substance use increases considerably, – the risk of drug overdose is 9-17 times
higher among formerly incarcerated individuals than in the general population. However,
significant gaps in our understanding of structural and individual pathways of post-incarceration
substance use limit treatment effectiveness. The proposed study will examine factors
associated with changes in substance use and substance use treatment adequacy over a one-
year period post-release among formerly incarcerated individuals in New York City (NYC),
where opioid-related overdose rates more than doubled between 2015 and 2017 and are
increasing among people of color and residents in high poverty communities. We will examine
the extent to which participants receive substance use treatment services recommended by
their scores on the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) patient placement criteria
(PPC). We will use novel spatially informed multi-level modeling strategies to investigate
individual and environmental factors that influence substance use among individuals released in
NYC from institutions in the New York State Department of Corrections and Community
Supervision (NYSDOCCS), one of the largest U.S. criminal justice correctional agencies.
Guided by social ecological theory, we will address the following Specific Aims: 1). Characterize
substance use at five time points over a 12-month period (at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-
months) among those recently released from incarceration; 2). Identify individual- and
environment-level predictors of post-incarceration substance use; and 3) Investigate
discrepancies between ASAM PPC composite scores (a measure of addiction severity)
generated and levels of substance use treatment over time. The proposed research will identify
substance use treatment gaps and influential factors that are amenable to intervention in the
interest of informing effective responses to problematic substance use."
10861837,"Hepcidin is a key iron regulatory hormone that controls expression of the iron exporter ferroportin to increase the iron supply when needed to support erythropoiesis and other essential functions, but to prevent the toxicity of iron excess. Abnormally low hepcidin expression leads to the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis and contributes to iron loading anemias such as b-thalassemia. Excess hepcidin contributes to iron restricted erythropoiesis and anemia in a number of chronic diseases. A key unanswered question is how the liver senses iron levels in the body to appropriately coordinate hepcidin expression. We previously discovered that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)6-SMAD signaling pathway is a central regulator of hepcidin transcription in response to iron. Moreover, modulators of the BMP6-SMAD pathway regulate hepcidin expression to treat hemochromatosis and anemia of chronic disease in animal models. These studies have already yielded important insights into the pathophysiology of hemochromatosis and have identified the BMP6-SMAD pathway as a viable therapeutic target for iron disorders. However, it remains largely unknown how iron is sensed by the liver to regulate BMP6-SMAD signaling and thereby hepcidin production. In the last funding period, we discovered that liver endothelial cells are a key source for BMP6 in the regulation of hepcidin production. We also established a primary liver endothelial cell culture model and demonstrated that BMP6 transcription in liver endothelial cells is governed by intracellular iron content. Finally, we used this cell culture model in conjunction with quantitative proteomics and RNA-seq screens to identify iron transporters and transcription factor pathways that we hypothesize play a key role in mediating BMP6 production in response to iron to control hepcidin expression and systemic iron homeostasis. In Specific Aim I, we will use primary liver endothelial cultures and genetic mouse models to establish the role of specific iron transporters in controlling liver endothelial cell iron content and iron-regulated pathways to govern BMP6 expression. In Specific Aim II, we will use primary liver endothelial cell cultures, chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter assays, pharmacologic approaches, and endothelial conditional knockout mouse models to determine the role of candidate transcription factor pathways and their mechanism of activation in controlling BMP6 production in response to iron. The long-term goals of this project are to understand how the BMP signaling pathway is modulated by different signals to regulate hepcidin expression and systemic iron balance, to gain insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of iron homeostasis in health and disease, and ultimately to develop new therapeutic strategies for treating disorders of iron metabolism."
10861867,"Treatment dropout is a primary challenge for individuals suffering with posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) following trauma exposure. Treatments for PTSD+AUD are effective at
reducing symptoms, yet treatment attrition is a critical issue. Dropout rates among individuals with PTSD+AUD
are higher than for those with PTSD alone, and dropout is associated with less clinical improvement. A clearer
understanding of the factors that contribute to dropout, including those who initiate services but do not start
treatment (nonstarters) and those who start but do not complete treatment (noncompleters), will enable us
to develop strategies that improve retention and treatment outcomes for this population. Examining modifiable
and theoretically informed constructs, such as difficulty tolerating emotional distress and coping motives for
alcohol use, may improve our understanding of treatment dropout. Additionally, observer ratings of in-session
behavior, or “thin slice” ratings, is a method of measuring predictors more proximal to when dropout occurs and
has the potential to be a robust predictor of dropout. Thin slice refers to short (e.g. 30 second) video clips of
expressive behavior rated by trained observers on specified constructs or outcomes of interest. The proposed
F32 will use mixed methods to explore reasons for treatment dropout using data collected from an existing
clinical trial for women with PTSD and heavy drinking following sexual assault. Specific aims are: 1) To identify
themes related to reasons for dropout for nonstarters and noncompleters by conducting qualitative interviews
with providers of sexual assault services (N = 10), which will be used to develop the “thin slice” rating
constructs of observed participant behavior for use in Aim 2. 2) To predict dropout and related treatment
processes (N = 100) using thin slice ratings and advanced statistical methods. Treatment dropout will be
examined within each treatment condition (imaginal exposure and alcohol skills training) and between
treatment conditions to test whether certain thin slice constructs are better at predicting dropout for certain
types of treatment. We will also examine trajectories of treatment processes related to dropout: difficulty
tolerating emotions and alcohol craving. 3) To enrich and contextualize Aim 2 quantitative findings by
concurrently conducting qualitative interviews exploring treatment initiation and dropout with women enrolled in
a clinical trial for PTSD and heavy drinking following sexual assault (N = 25). The applicant will receive training
in 1) PTSD and alcohol treatment process research, 2) conducting studies predicting dropout in clinical trials,
3) skill development for collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data, and 4) manuscript and grant
writing. The proposed study will make substantial contributions to our understanding of dropout, a necessary
first step to the development of strategies to increase retention and improve treatment outcomes for this
vulnerable population."

Project Summary/Abstract
This K23 proposal comprises a five-year career development program designed to lead Charles F. Schuler IV,
MD into independence as a physician scientist studying the confluence of food allergy, mucosal immunology,
and epithelial barrier function. Dr. Schuler is an allergy and clinical immunology physician scientist with a long-
term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of food allergy. This proposal builds on Dr. Schuler's
experiences in laboratory and clinical research and leverages an existing human biorepository of samples from
food allergy subjects undergoing oral food challenges, the gold standard of food allergy diagnosis. This proposal
will proceed within the rich training environment at the University of Michigan Division of Allergy/Clinical
Immunology and Mary H. Weiser Food Allergy Center, combining the co-mentorship of James R. Baker Jr, MD
and Nicholas W. Lukacs, PhD with an outstanding advisory board of investigators. Dr. Schuler will follow a plan
of formal coursework, professional development, and mentored research to successfully grow into an
independent physician scientist.
This mentored research includes 2 scientific Specific Aims
  Aim 1: Determine the role of barrier gene variants in FLG, SPINK5, and JAM-A in food allergy
development.
  Aim 2: Examine the ability of net skin barrier measurements to predict or measure oral food
 challenge outcomes.
Through completing these overarching Aims, Dr. Schuler will (1) evaluate how known and unknown variants in
these key barrier genes contribute to food allergy; (2), identify additional barrier-related genes that lead to food
anaphylaxis while seeking to construct a polygenic risk score for food allergy; (3), define the ability of trans-
epidermal water loss to identify patients at risk of food anaphylaxis; and (4) develop trans-epidermal water loss
as a real-time clinical measurement of anaphylaxis during food challenges.
The programmatic line of research established here will lead to several opportunities for R01 proposals. In
addition, the findings from this proposal will be validated using the Southeast Michigan Food Allergy
Collaborative birth cohort, a large-scale biorepository that is now in development. This work can also lead to the
development of non-invasive food allergy risk profiles to minimize the need for costly, cumbersome, and risky
oral food challenges. Further, through this work Dr. Schuler will develop research skills broadly applicable to
many different areas of allergy research. Thus, this K23 award will support and greatly accelerate the career
development of Dr. Schuler into a successful, innovative, and independent investigator."

an expert, high level to assure reproducibility. Animal care, and surgical training are therefore a prerequisite
for reliable experimental readouts. Transplants in older animals come with additional challenges as those
animals are more sensitive to blood loss, length of surgery, and anesthesia. Current and ongoing expertise in
microsurgery will therefore be essential for the success of our project. The overall goals of this core are: 1.) to
perform transplant surgeries for all projects under this PPG; 2.) to coordinate experiments among projects and
maximize the use of biological samples; 3.) to store and archive extra human/mouse biological samples; 4.) to
provide support for additional interventions including recurrent blood collection, intravenous infusions of

10862424,"Abstract
The steadily increasing elderly population and its rising incidence of organ failure have led to a burgeoning
number of aged patients on the waitlist for solid organ transplants. Lymph nodes (LNs) play a critical role in
controlling alloimmune responses and formation of immune tolerance to transplantation under costimulatory
blockade. LN stromal cells are referred to as fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). FRC are the chief architect of LN
by producing and maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers upon which T cells that have entered through
high endothelial cells crawl to encounter dendritic cells (DCs), which present allo-antigens. In addition to
providing the LN scaffold, they also produce various chemokines that regulate the homing of T and B cells. The
trafficking of T cells to the LN and proper positioning of DCs are critical requirements for the generation of iTregs
following anti-CD40L treatment and suppression of alloreactive T cells. The role of aged FRCs in changing the
stromal microenvironment in aging LNs is a novel concept central to the pathogenesis of alloimmunity in elderly
transplant recipients, which remains to be fully explored. Pursuing our preliminary data, our main hypothesis is
that aging-associated senescence of FRCs transforms them to pro-inflammatory myofibroblasts that create an
immunostimulatory LN microenvironment that produces resistance against the promotion of graft acceptance
under costimulatory blockade. Aged LNs contain a significant accumulation of ECM, and aged FRCs experience
a high level of senescence, resulting in an increase in the population of pro-inflammatory T cells. FRCs are
derived from lymphoid tissue organizer cells in a lymphotoxin β-receptor (LTβR)-dependent manner. We further
hypothesize that LTβR signaling in aged FRCs plays a critical role in regulating their immunoregulatory function
and the fate of transplant tolerance. Pursuant to our preliminary data, we will test the hypothesis that FRC
therapy and/or targeted delivery of an LTβR agonist will rejuvenate the LN stroma of aged mice, supporting the
tolerogenic effect of ant-CD40L. We are proposing three AIMS as follows. AIM 1 will study the mechanisms by
which aging-associated senescence in FRCs regulates alloimmunity in the LN. AIM 2 will examine the
importance of lymphotoxin pathways in aged LN stroma and transplant immunity. AIM 3 will study novel
approaches to rejuvenate aged LN stroma to restore immune tolerance following anti-CD40L treatment."
10862425,"Abstract
Organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage-organ failure. Notably, older patients (>65 years)
have shown the highest increase of those either waiting for, or having received, organ transplants. Clinically,
acute rejections are more challenging to treat in older recipients while chronic rejections are more frequent. At
the same time, older recipients have higher rates of infections and malignancies. Rather than generally impairing
immune responses, aging affects immune compartments and functions in specific ways. Thus, aging has
clinically most relevant consequences on transplant outcomes with effects on alloimmune responses that are
only marginally appreciated. In addition, effectiveness and side-effects of immunosuppression are modified in
older recipients. Of particular relevance, aging limits the immunoregulatory capacity of co-stimulatory blockade.
Our previous studies have detailed the consequences of aging on alloreactive T cells including CD-4, CD-8 and
regulatory T-cells. Aging also affects T cell metabolism with a compromised mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation that is not compensated by aerobic glycolysis in old CD4+ T cells, thus initiating a reliance of old
CD4+ T cells on glutaminolysis for their proliferation and activation. From a therapeutical perspective, inhibition
of glutamate metabolism in CD4+ T cells specifically prolonged graft survival in older recipients. Of additional
relevance is that players of the innate and adaptive immune response are affected differently by aging. Here, we
observed an activation of old donor DCs through the release of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mt-DNA)
originating from senescent cells that accumulated in old organs leading to an intensified Th17 response. Clearly,
aging has broad effects on cellular and immunosenescence representing two distinct but interrelated pathogenic
processes. However, mechanisms driving the interaction of cellular immunity with alloimmune responses in older
recipients are not understood and may provide an opportunity to refine treatment while identifying novel
therapeutic targets. We are uniquely positioned and have accumulated an extensive body of preliminary and
published data in aging and organ transplantation. As our central hypothesis, we submit that aging rewires
alloimmunity with critical effects on allorecognition, DC/T cell interaction, and T cell metabolism. As a corollary
hypothesis we submit that cellular senescence augments alloimmunity and that a targeted delivery of
nanoparticles will provide novel opportunities for a refined immunosuppression in older recipients. In Aim 1, we
will delineate mechanisms by which DCs of aged recipients regulate T cell alloimmunity. Aim 2 will detail T-cell
metabolism and age-specific regulation of critical alloreactive T cells. Aim 3 will develop an effective age-specific
immunosuppression through nano-delivery of glutamine inhibitors and senolytics to DLNs restoring the immune
regulatory capacity of co-stimulatory blockade."
10862426,"The proportion of aged patients undergoing solid organ transplantation is steadily increasing. Despite this,
therapeutics to treat rejection are designed based on a youthful immune system. The aged immune system
likely has unique mechanisms controlling transplant rejection which increase susceptibility to opportunistic
infections. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play a critical role in mediating B cell responses, including antibody
mediated rejection (AbMR). Newer data suggest Tfh cells are a heterogeneous composition of uniquely
functioning cell subsets. Therefore, it may be possible to uncouple transplant rejection from anti-viral immunity.
However, a fundamental understanding of Tfh differentiation stages and how these function to promote
alloimmunity and rejection in the context of aging is lacking. The objective of the proposed studies is to elucidate
how the aged immune system controls alloimmunity in the context of kidney and heart transplantation. We
hypothesize that the inflamm-aging environment causes Tfh rewiring which promotes B cell alloimmunity. We
also hypothesize that targeting specific Tfh stages may uncouple allo- and anti-viral immunity. To test these
hypotheses, we will: 1) determine how aging alters Tfh-mediated B cell alloimmunity after solid organ
transplantation, 2) assess how the inflamm-aging environment causes Tfh rewiring to induce a senescence-like
state, and 3) determine if nanoparticle therapy to age-associated Tfh rewiring can alleviate transplant immunity
while maintaining anti-viral immunity. We will pursue these aims using innovative strategies to identify and
perturb Tfh cell stages in vivo during kidney transplantation in aged mice. We will combine these innovative
tools with transcriptomics, metabolomics and high-dimensional analyses of B cell responses at the single cell
level. The expected outcome of these studies is to determine mechanisms controlling allo- and anti-viral
immunity in aging. These studies are significant because they will provide strategies to prevent rejection in
aging while limiting susceptibility to infection."
10855419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Improved treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) requires better understanding of key regulators of survival
and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and their crosstalk with immune system. Upregulation and
hyperactivation of the β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase underlie CRC pathogenesis and poor responses to
chemotherapy. While directly inhibiting β-TrCP proved to be practically difficult, here we propose to target the
key regulators of β-TrCP in CRC including proteins that stabilize its mRNA (IGF2BP1) and protein (PARP11).
Our published and preliminary data indicate that IGF2BP1 and PARP11 act within malignant cells as well as
within benign immune cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to stimulate colorectal tumors growth and
progression and limit their responses to chemotherapeutic regimens. These data support an overarching
hypothesis that targeting IGF2BP1 and PARP11 should elicit potent anti-tumor effects and improve the efficacy
of anti-cancer chemotherapies. We will test this hypothesis in three independent yet integrated Specific Aims. In
Aim 1 we will determine the roles of IGF2BP1 in cancer cells and in the pro-tumorigenic TME and in responses
to therapy. We will utilize genetic modulation of IGF2BP1 expression in CRC cells and cells of the TME to
understand the role of IGF2BP1 for tumor growth, metastases, and sensitivity to the FOLFOX regimen, which is
a standard of care chemotherapy for CRC patients. Mechanisms governing IGF2BP1 expression in TME as well
as mechanisms of TME-dependent involvement of IGF2BP1 in sensitivity to chemotherapy will be investigated.
Aim 2 will determine the importance of PARP11 in growth and progression of intestinal tumors as well as their
responses to anti-tumor therapy. We will use genetic, molecular, and pharmacologic approaches to modulate
PARP11 in colon adenocarcinoma cells or in the non-malignant TME cells to determine the importance of
PARP11 in pro-tumorigenic phenotypes in vitro and ability to form orthotopic tumors and liver metastases in vivo.
PARP11-dependent mechanisms underlying control of malignant cells by anti-tumor immune system and
responsiveness of tumors to chemotherapy will be investigated. Aim 3 will examine the effects of
pharmacological targeting of the regulators of β-TrCP to improve the responses of colon adenocarcinoma tumors
to chemotherapy. We will determine the anti-tumor effects of novel, potent and highly selective inhibitors of
IGF2BP1 (AVJ16) and PARP11 (ITK7) as mono-agents and their ability to improve the responses to FOLFOX
regimen.
 Completion of these studies should gain the insight on the importance of IGF2BP1 and PARP11 in
colorectal tumor growth and metastasis, and characterize these regulators as potential vulnerabilities, which
could be exploited for improving chemotherapy of CRC."

 Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precancerous state affecting 8-10 million adults with no
existing cancer control strategies. As a precursor to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), MBL is characterized
by the presence of monoclonal B-cell clones in the peripheral blood of otherwise healthy individuals. Early
evidence supports that MBL increases risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including progression to CLL requiring
therapy, development of other hematological and solid cancers, hospitalizations due to serious infections, and
reduced humoral immune response to vaccinations. However, the scale and diversity of MBL studies is
currently limited by the need for flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to diagnose
MBL. These biospecimens are rarely available in large biobanking or cohort studies that could otherwise allow
more comprehensive and well-powered investigation of the causes and consequences of MBL, especially in
populations of diverse ancestries. We propose to overcome these limitations by developing and validating a
strategy to predict MBL status (Aim 1). In brief, we propose using existing genotyping array data, that is readily
available in many biobanks, to identify mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), which affect large segments
of DNA and include gains, losses, and copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity events. Recent work in
biobank studies has established mCAs as a potent risk factor for lymphoid malignancies but MBL is also a
major risk factor of lymphoid malignancies, and thus the question of how mCAs relate to MBL is unknown. We
have collected the largest cohort of individuals with MBL and genetic data, and in our preliminary analyses, we
found that autosomal mCAs are associated with risk of MBL with an odds ratio of 50.5 (95% confidence
interval 36.5-70.6, P = 1.34x10-152) with high discrimination. Aim 1 will validate these results, develop a
predictive model with other known risk factors for MBL, and then examine generalizability of the model to
individuals with strong family history of lymphoid malignancy and to individuals of African ancestry. We further
hypothesize that mCAs are drivers of B-cell clone growth. In Aim 2 we will be the first to quantify the incidence
of mCAs and the change in cell fraction of mCAs over time from serial peripheral blood samples that have also
been screened for MBL. We will then evaluate the relationship between mCAs and growth trajectories of B-cell
clones in individuals with MBL. Successful completion of these aims will unlock the ability to study MBL in the
largest cohorts in the world, enabling future studies of MBL at an unprecedented scale. As we continue to
improve understanding of the consequences of MBL, risk stratification of individuals with MBL will be essential.
This proposal will also begin to enable such stratification by characterizing MBL clonal trajectories. Together,
these aims will catalyze future studies of MBL to improve understanding of to inform etiologic factors and risk
stratification of this prevalent precancer for eventual cancer control."

Vast numbers of mutations in human protein coding sequences have been identified by DNA
sequencing, but for only a tiny percentage of these variants do we understand the biochemical
basis for any defect. This project seeks to develop an approach to characterize the
biochemical activities – for such activities as thermostability, post-translational modification,
kinetics and catalysis – of protein variants at high throughput using the ease and scale of DNA
sequencing. Knowledge of biochemical activities can be used to annotate clinically-relevant
proteins, many of which have variants that are nearly all either unannotated or annotated as
variants of uncertain significance for their effect on pathogenicity. In the proposed approach,
each variant will be covalently linked in vivo to a unique RNA barcode by fusion to a tRNA
modifying enzyme that recognizes and couples to a short stem-loop RNA sequence. The
stem-loop will contain a barcode sequence that identifies the variant. The barcodes allow a
pool of variants to be subjected to a biochemical assay, with the results read out by DNA
sequencing of the barcodes. By developing this technology to express variant proteins in vivo,
we allow these proteins to fold or become post-translationally modified in their native cellular
environment; to bind to other cellular proteins or ligands; to become modified upon cellular
perturbation; or to be synthesized in a variety of hosts, including human cultured cells. As
proof-of-concept examples of the use of this method, in Aim 1, variants of dihydrofolate
reductase will be assessed for thermal stability. The variants will be fused to the tRNA
modifying enzyme and expressed in E. coli; the fusion proteins will be purified in a pooled
format; and aliquots of the proteins will be heated to varying temperatures followed by
purification of the soluble, undenatured protein (thermal proteome profiling). The number of
sequence reads of the soluble fraction of each variant allows melting temperatures to be
determined. In Aim 2, we will develop this method in mammalian cells to quantify the
abundance of protein variants of thiopurine methyltransferase. In summary, we will develop a
high throughput in vivo protein barcoding method to study fundamental biochemical properties
of variant proteins that have so far remained inaccessible by current methods."

We propose the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative 2 (EDGI2), a new collaborative R01 in response to PAR-
23-050 Clinical Studies of Mental Illness. Its single-site predecessors, EDGI1 (R01 MH120170) and ARFID-GEN
(R56 MH129437) have been resoundingly successful. We now unite the four original EDGI1 sites with
exceptionally productive global new sites to advance genomic discovery across all major eating disorders (EDs)
to identify biologically, clinically, culturally, and therapeutically meaningful and actionable insights. Aim 1: EDGI2
extends our core business by increasing sample size, diversity, and ED phenotypes. Using our comprehensive
harmonized online assessment battery, we will phenotype and bio-sample 20,000 new participants with anorexia
nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
(ARFID), and controls. EDGI2 emphasizes co-production—with representatives from minoritized and
marginalized communities, we will ascertain 30% of samples from underrepresented groups. We will also over-
sample individuals with severe and enduring AN (SE-AN), whose DNA may be enriched for causative alleles.
Aim 2: We will apply statistical genetic analyses to explicate heterogeneity and biology of EDs by: conducting
standard GWAS analyses on diagnoses, trans-diagnostic behaviors, and continuous phenotypes including
polygenic risk score (PRS), and rare variant CNV analyses; identifying clinically meaningfully patient subsets;
and intensively evaluating our proposal that AN is a metabo-psychiatric disorders using LDSC, PRSet, pheWAS,
and Mendelian randomization to clarify direction of causation. Aim 3: We will evaluate the relative roles of genetic
and environmental risk and resilience factors to inform risk prediction by phenotypically characterizing cases and
controls with high and low PRS for EDs and then by genotypically characterizing those with severe ED
phenotypes. We will characterize distinct genetic or molecular groupings/patterns across cases and controls and
phenotypically characterize identified molecular subtypes. Aim 4: To determine where in the body EDs “live”, we
will identify brain cell types and anatomical regions implicated by genomic studies of EDs; predict genetically
regulated gene expression (GREx) in brain, gut, adipose, and other ED-relevant tissues; use snRNAseq atlases
to sharpen preliminary GTEx and TWAS analyses to identify brain cell types strongly implicated by the genomics
of each ED; expand to relevant non-brain cell types (e.g., adipose, muscle, liver, salivary); and use dynamic
GREx to model gene expression in ED-relevant contexts (e.g., sex, BMI, stress) enabling precise and
personalized modelling of gene expression. Aim 5: EDGI2 will culminate in a Translational Summit uniting
forward-thinking stakeholders from multiple sectors to develop a translational roadmap for evidence-based ED
prevention and treatment. EDGI2 will yield critical knowledge about genetic and environmental risk for EDs,
reveal mechanisms that potentiate or protect against genetic risk, and transition ED genetics from discovery to
clinical translation."

Episodic memory involves the encoding and retrieval of past experiences to support learned behavior. Aside
from these mnemonic processes, it also requires the ability to regulate memory (i.e. executive processes). For
example, many real-world decisions will engage episodic retrieval, for which executive processes must help to
integrate and evaluate the quality of remembered information (mnemonic evidence) and guide behavior to
either decision, action, or continued memory search. While the neural basis of episodic memory encoding and
retrieval have been a major focus of research, far less is known about its executive aspects. Executive
mnemonic functions likely involve an anatomical substrate that is (i) multisensory/associative, (ii) engaged by
memory/executive processing, and (iii) strongly interconnected with both mnemonic regions in the medial
temporal lobe (MTL) and executive prefrontal (PFC) regions. Prior non-human primate studies, as well as
human electrophysiology and neuroimaging data, suggest that posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) fulfills these
criteria. Our central hypothesis is that the PCC plays a critical and unique role in executive control of episodic
memory retrieval. We further hypothesize that it comprises three subregions regions: dorsal PCC, ventral PCC
and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). These subregions are proposed to play complementary roles, corresponding to
retrieval regulation, retrieval integration, and scene perception and transformation, respectively. In this
account, PCC is a convergence zone of memory and executive systems, whose specific functional
organization accounts for prior discrepancies between studies and species. Here, we utilize human intracranial
recordings, including single unit data and stimulation within PCC, to better resolve the functional organization
of this region. We will therefore employ an array of cognitive experiments to delineate three PCC subregions
supporting the encoding, retrieval and executive control of memory processing (Aim 1). In delineating these
subregions, we will also seek to differentiate PCC responses from those occurring in memory (MTL) and
executive (dlPFC & ACC) functional networks (Aim 2). Finally, based on these observations, we will
demonstrate the causal role of PCC subregions on behavior and local/network activity (Aim 3). By studying
PCC, a convergence zone of memory and executive systems, progress can be made in elucidating how the
failure to successfully leverage past experiences in daily behavior can occur as a common symptom of both
neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease) and multiple psychiatric conditions (e.g. schizophrenia)
implicating PCC dysfunction."

Public health response to infectious disease epidemics requires multidisciplinary, quantitative, and critical skills
to address all aspects of control from preparedness to elimination. The proposed training program will provide
critical training in modern methods of infectious disease epidemiology within the Department of Epidemiology
at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All trainees in this program will receive rigorous
training in three foundational areas: Epidemiologic Study Design and Inference, Ethics, and Translating
Infectious Disease Research through an applied practicum. In addition, trainees will focus on one of three
areas of methodological specialization (1) Transmission Modeling and Infectious Disease Dynamics, (2)
Molecular Epidemiology and Phylogenetics, or (3) Disease Mapping and Burden Estimation. These three areas
of specialization were selected because of their importance across all phases of the response to infectious
disease threats, from preparedness, through emergence, endemic control and elimination. The core faculty
and affiliate faculty participating in this training program bring strong expertise in each of these areas of
methodological specialization, as well as deep expertise in a large number of pathogen systems, and lead
projects that offer numerous training opportunities in these areas. Emphasis will be placed on integrating and
translating epidemiological and scientific results to public health policy and practice. All trainees will be
provided with practical experience in translational research and implementation science through practicums
and research projects. Hence, trainees will be required devote a research aim to applying advanced methods
to policy and practice. Two post-doctoral and 2-3 pre-doctoral trainees will be supported in each year of the
program, and will be paired with both methodological area and pathogen specific mentors. By focusing on
critical methodological areas, this training program will provide critical skills that will prepare trainees to
conduct important and impactful research in all phases of the infectious disease ‘lifecycle’, from emergence to
elimination."
10861772,"Prostatitis accounts for 2 million outpatient visits per year in the United States, including
1% of those to primary care physicians. Chronic prostatitis/Chronic pelvic pain syndrome
(CP/CPPS) is clinically characterized by dysuria and pain in the perineum, testes, penis,
and suprapubic region. Despite CPPS accounting for 90% of all chronic prostatitis, there
is an absence of effective therapies. In animal models, the chronic pelvic pain is shown to
be associated with immune dysregulation and the activation of nociceptive pathways in
the peripheral and central nervous system. We previously demonstrated that a
commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis strain derived from the prostate of a healthy human
volunteer could be delivered intraurethrally to rapidly inhibit the pathogenic immune
response and lead to a profound amelioration of pelvic pain. In the last period of this
grant we isolated, purified, and recapitulated the anti-nociceptive effects using the
lipoteichoic acid (SELTA) component of the whole bacteria. We demonstrated
immunomodulatory activity through induced expression of checkpoint ligands PD-L1
and PD-L2. In preliminary studies in support of this application, we examined direct
effects of SELTA on dorsal root ganglia neurons and identified that SELTA is capable of
TLR2 dependent activation of a homeostatic neuronal pathway involved in pain
modulation. SELTA treatment was also demonstrated to increase expression of the
endogenous opioid pathway in neurons. We therefore hypothesize that SELTA can
mediate anti-nociceptive effects by modulation of neuronal excitability through activation
of homeostatic inhibitory signaling and induction of endogenous opioid pathways. In this
study we will dissect novel mechanisms underlying activation of these anti-nociceptive
pathways using a combination of animal models, ex vivo dorsal root ganglia slice
recordings and in vitro signaling studies. Proof of concept for SELTA activity will be
demonstrated in human dorsal root ganglia. The proposed studies will provide a
mechanistic understanding of how SELTA exerts anti-nociceptive activity and will set-
the-stage for its development as a novel cutting-edge therapeutic for chronic pelvic pain."

Sleep permeates our early existence: A typical human newborn sleeps 16 hours each day, evenly divided
between active (REM) sleep and quiet sleep. The relatively high proportion of active sleep in newborns is the
foundation for the decades-old hypothesis that active sleep is important for infant brain development. In
considering this hypothesis, it is important to remember that active sleep is a complex state composed of a
variety of behavioral and physiological components that emerge and coalesce over development. Thus, it may
be that one or more of these components play outsized roles in promoting brain development. One such
candidate component is the phasic activity that comprises twitches of the limbs, face, and eyes. Over the past
15 years, research in infant rats has revealed that sensory feedback from twitching limbs triggers discrete and
abundant activity throughout the sensorimotor system, cascading from the spinal cord to the brainstem,
cerebellum, thalamus, sensorimotor cortex, and hippocampus. In recent years, with funding from the Gates
Foundation and an R21 from NICHD, investigations were extended to full-term human infants over the first seven
postnatal months. Using behavioral measures and high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, this
research revealed heretofore unknown features about the spatiotemporal organization of infant sleep and
twitching and introduced new developmental milestones and hypotheses. Here, we propose to extend these
efforts to preterm infants for two reasons: Preterm infants exhibit an even higher proportion of active sleep than
newborn full-term infants, and they are at increased risk for deficits in motor skill, cerebral palsy, autism, and
other neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, we will determine whether twitching can enhance our understanding
of the origins and time course of atypical developmental trajectories and guide future interventions. Very preterm
human infants (<32 weeks postmenstrual age) and mildly preterm infants (32-36 weeks postmenstrual age) in
the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the Stead Family Children’s Hospital at the University of Iowa will be
recruited to participate in a longitudinal study spanning the period before (Phase I) and after (Phase II) discharge
from the NICU. Every two weeks during Phase I, sleep behavior will be recorded along with EEG activity, and
respiratory rate. During Phase II, in the same preterm infants as well as full-term age-matched controls, sleep
behavior, EEG activity, and respiratory rate will be recorded three times between one week and six months
corrected age. Neurobehavioral and motor skill assessments will be performed at one and six months of age
and clinical follow-up assessments will be performed at two years of age. Because this study is longitudinal,
behavioral and physiological sleep data will be compared in the same infants across Phases I and II and related
to developmental outcomes. Ultimately, this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand
how sleep and sleep-related behavior contribute to typical and atypical development in early life."

 Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial
infarction and strokes, and results in tremendous morbidity and mortality. A Western-type diet is a major risk
factor for atherosclerosis because of the high saturated fat, cholesterol, and refined carbohydrate contents.
Dietary strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease burden therefore focus on restriction of saturated fat,
cholesterol, and refined carbohydrates whereas “lean” protein intake is recommended and has become popular.
However, results from studies conducted in animal models suggest high dietary protein intake is also
atherogenic. Our extensive preliminary data in animal models show that dietary protein increases atherosclerotic
plaque formation and size and promotes necrotic core formation, a characteristic of rupture-prone plaques. The
goal of the current proposal is to provide deeper insights into the relationship between protein intake and the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by studying the mechanisms involved in protein-mediated atherogenesis and
formation of necrotic plaques. Our overarching hypothesis is that high protein intake drives atherosclerosis via
leucine-mediated mTORC1 signaling in macrophages, which inhibits macrophage mitophagy and aggrephagy
and stimulates macrophage proliferation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that proteins from animal sources are
more atherogenic than proteins from plant sources, because animal proteins contain more leucine than plant
proteins. We will test these hypotheses by using a sophisticated array of experimental strategies, including
assays in primary macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages and genetically engineered mouse
models. In addition, we will begin to translate the results obtained in vitro and in animals to people, and explore
approaches to pharmacologically target the pro-atherogenic pathways as novel cardiovascular therapeutics. Our
proposal represents a paradigm shift in how a Western-type diet affects vascular health which has important
implications since many adults in Western societies consume excess protein and dietary protein is heavily
marketed for its presumed beneficial health effects."

Cell-cell fusion is critical to the conception, development and physiology of multicellular organisms, and is
involved in a variety of biological processes, such as fertilization, myogenesis, placenta development, bone
remodeling, immune response, tumorigenesis, and aspects of stem cells-mediated tissue regeneration.
Failure in cell fusion leads to defects such as infertility, congenital myopathy, osteopetrosis, immune
deficiency, and pre-eclampsia. A mechanistic understanding of cell fusion is not only important for
fundamental biology but may also provide basis for its manipulation in therapeutic settings. My lab has
been using Drosophila myoblast fusion as a model to study the general mechanisms underlying cell fusion.
We have made an unprecedented discover that cell fusion is an asymmetric process in which one cell
(attacking cell) invades its fusion partner (receiving cell) using actin-propelled membrane protrusions to
promote fusion pore formation. Building on insights we learned from myoblast fusion in vivo, we have
reconstituted high-efficiency cell fusion in an otherwise non-fusogenic, non-muscle cell line and uncovered
a novel function for invasive membrane protrusions in fusogen engagement. Furthermore, we have
discovered dynamic mechanosensory responses in the receiving fusion partner and demonstrated that
mechanical tension is a driving force for cell fusion. Our studies to date have provided significant insights
into the function of the actin cytoskeleton in promoting cell membrane juxtaposition and fusion. In the next
five years, we will expand our research into two new directions. First, we will extrapolate the mechanisms
that we uncovered in Drosophila to mammals and investigate the potential function of the actin
cytoskeleton in mammalian cell fusion, as well as how transmembrane fusogenic proteins coordinate with
the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell fusion. Second, we will identify and characterize novel
transmembrane proteins, including new fusogens, in cell fusion using the reconstituted cell-fusion culture
system as a model. We will continue to use an interdisciplinary approach including genetics, molecular
biology, biochemistry, biophysics, live imaging, super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy in our
proposed research. By expanding from Drosophila to mouse, and from the actin cytoskeleton to
transmembrane proteins, our research will not only gain major new insights into the fundamental principles
of cell-cell fusion, but also have far-reaching impact on a broad range of fields, including membrane
biology, cell biology and developmental biology."

Intermittent fasting and caloric restriction are newly identified therapeutic interventions against cardiometabolic
disease. Our laboratory discovered that activating the hepatic glucose fasting response is sufficient to convey
several of the key therapeutic effects of generalized caloric restriction. This is clinically relevant because
targeting hepatic glucose transport is highly amenable to small-molecule and nutraceutical therapy. Therefore,
our long-term goal is to understand adaptive liver glucose metabolism during fasting to produce new therapies
that leverage these pathways against cardiometabolic disease.
Intermittent fasting in rodents blocks pathological remodeling and infarct expansion after myocardial infarction,
and treating mice with FGF21 – a liver-derived peptide hormone secreted in response to fasting – prevents
experimental cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and LV dysfunction. We demonstrated that blocking
hepatic glucose transport using the naturally occurring disaccharide, trehalose, recapitulates the hepatic
adaptive fasting response. Our new data now demonstrate that oral trehalose recapitulates the effects of
intermittent fasting on cardiac protection against pathological remodeling. Specifically, trehalose induces hepatic
FGF21, and prevents pathological LVH and LV dysfunction in response to chronic pressure overload. We also
identified a novel trehalose analog that resists degradation by host and microbial metabolism, and which
activates hepatic fasting-like signal transduction to a greater extent than native trehalose. This study’s objective
is thus to define mechanisms and contexts of cardioprotection by trehalose-class compounds as a prelude to
the use of these compounds in human trials. Our central hypothesis is that hepatic GLUT inhibition blocks LVH
and LVD by activating canonical hepatic fasting signals to the myocardium.
We propose three Specific Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will delineate mechanisms by which
trehalose prevents LVH and LVD. In Aim 2, we define pathophysiological contexts in which trehalose attenuates
secondary cardiomyopathies. In Aim 3, we examine the impact of trehalose catabolism on its efficacy against
secondary cardiomyopathies.
The innovation of this proposal is that we our team has identified and will examine further: 1) a novel and
tractable cardioprotective pathway, and 2) a novel compound class that activates this cardioprotective pathway.
Completing these aims will define how hepatocyte fasting responses protect from pathological remodeling and
dysfunction; and nominate specific clinical contexts in which the adaptive hepatic fasting response is
cardioprotective. The impact of this work is that it will mechanistically inform next-generation glucose fasting-
mimetics, which also leverage the adaptive fasting response against cardiac disease, and will justify further
efforts toward clinical trials that utilize trehalose-class compounds to ameliorate secondary cardiomyopathies."

Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and globally, and impaired diabetic wound
healing is a significant and growing clinical problem. The long-term goal of our research is to develop small
molecule therapeutics to effectively promote healing of diabetic wounds. Diabetic wounds are deficient in
stromal derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), a potent chemokine involved in progenitor cell recruitment, angiogenesis,
and granulation tissue formation, mediated through binding to the CXCR4 receptor and the establishment of a
chemotactic gradient. Our previous research data confirmed that targeting SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling pathway
has great potential to improve diabetic wound healing. Therefore, screening small molecule agonists that can
activate CXCR4 receptor and its downstream pathway will provide a novel therapy for diabetic wound healing,
and has great potential for clinical application and commercialization. In our previous RO1 (R01DK105010,
Identifying CXCR4 receptor agonists to improve diabetic wound healing), we screened the entire NIH SMR
library of >370k molecules using our robust testing funnel and identified 303 lead compounds. These lead
compounds were further validated with by counter-screen, secondary chemotaxis/migration assays, and their
ability to correct abnormal expression of microRNA-146a, 15b, and 29a, resulting in the identification of 2 lead
scaffolds. In an exciting preliminary study we tested the ability of our lead scaffold CAG1 to improve diabetic
wound healing following injection into murine diabetic wounds. We found that a single CAG1 injection resulted
in a significant improvement in the rate of diabetic wound closure, but the optimal formulation and mechanisms
of correction remain to be determined. The objective of this work is to determine the ability of our novel small
molecule CXCR4 agonists to correct the diabetic wound healing impairment in vivo, optimize the formulation
and pharmacokinetics in vitro and in vivo using a medicinal chemistry approach, determine the mechanisms of
action, and then extend these observations to the clinically relevant porcine model. The following Specific
Aims are proposed: Specific aim 1: Conduct lead optimization of the 5-aryl oxazole and triazolo
thiadiazine series using structure- activity- relationship medicinal chemistry approaches, Determine
compound in vitro EC50 values in primary and functional assays, KD values in a CXCR4 binding assay
and determine effect on human diabetic fibroblast expression of miR15b, and miR29a. Specific aim 2:
Perform in vitro stability, skin permeability and metabolism studies and determine the mechanisms of
diabetic wound healing correction in a murine model of wound healing for compounds advancing to
tier 4. Specific aim 3: Identify a CAG1 or CAG2 lead compound in tier 5 and Validate that CXCR4
agonist corrects the diabetic wound healing impairment and is non-toxic in a pre-clinical porcine
model."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications are the leading cause of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related morbidity
and mortality, creating a significant burden on the public health system. This burden is in part attributable to poor
medication adherence, with 21-42% of patients failing to properly adhere to their care. Importantly, this issue is
especially pronounced in minority and low-income populations, which show higher rates of chronic illness
and lower medication adherence. Interventions that foster and reinforce patient-centered communication
between clinicians and patients show promise in improving health outcomes. However, they have not been
widely implemented, in part due to a lack of compelling evidence for their effectiveness in real primary care
settings. Project Objective: We propose to evaluate the impact of our patient activation program: Office
Guidelines Applied to Practice (Office-GAP) combined with mobile phone text messaging reinforcement
(Care4life) on medication adherence, in minority and low-income patients with DM compared to mobile texting
alone. Office-GAP incorporates shared decision-making and a decision/support checklist to be completed during
office visits, to foster patients' investment in their own care. Care4life is a cell phone messaging service that
informs and encourages patients to adhere to goals and improve communication.
Our long-term goal is to develop a model that can reliably improve and sustain adherence and can be
successfully implemented in primary care clinics to close the morbidity and mortality gap for
minority/low-income DM patients. We hypothesize that the combined face-to-face patient activation and
mobile phone delivered reinforcement methods will facilitate communication between patients and care
providers, improving the frequency, accuracy, and timeliness of communication while reinforcing shared goals
and engendering mutual respect more than mobile phone texting alone. Improved communication between
patients and physicians may improve medication adherence, blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure
control, and patient satisfaction with providers, and ultimately decrease burden of illness.
Research Strategy: We will conduct a randomized community-based clinical trial in Federally-Qualified Health
Clinics (FQHCs) in Michigan. We will enroll 378 patients in 16 teams in clinics serving low-income and minority
patients. All patients will receive usual care and medication for DM and CVD prevention. Eight teams will be
randomly chosen to use mobile phone texting alone, and 8 teams will combine Office-GAP with Care4life. We
will evaluate the impact of these shared decision-making strategies for patients and providers in the clinics.
Impact: If successfully translated to clinical practice, these interventions have the potential to significantly impact
patient care in FQHCs, improving outcomes for DM and CVD. This research also paves the way for shifting
clinical practice across a spectrum of chronic disease where medication non-adherence is an issue."

renewal for the Training Program in Myocardial Biology at Stanford (TIMBS). Our diverse program faculty are
drawn from departments at Stanford across many disciplines, and represent world renowned experts in their
chosen domains. The cohesion of this group, which includes physiologists, molecular biologists, engineers,
geneticists, and cardiologists has been fostered by the principal investigators in an environment which has for
decades placed a high value on multi-disciplinary collaboration. Close co-localization of basic science
departments and bioengineering with the school of medicine and brand new adult and pediatric hospitals
facilitates great synergy and a culture of innovation and translation. Although still relatively young, the TIMBS
program has over the last nine years already established itself as an important venue for the training of post-
doctoral fellows. The success of our initial trainees in obtaining grants and faculty positions, even at this early
stage, is testament to the talent of the applicants, the training provided, and the priority given the program by
the principal investigator mentors and faculty. This renewal application underscores and seeks to build on this
proven success. In particular, we reaffirm our commitment to rigorous scientific training by offering a period of
up to three years of protected time for research. The commitment begins with a ‘mentored’ recruitment process
with a special emphasis on enhacing diversity, continues with a comprehensive approach to learning the
scientific method with opportunities ranging from dedicated training seminars to a ‘visiting internship’, extensive
mentor-trainee interaction, and a comprehensive series of lectures and courses, including biostatistics, the
responsible conduct of research, and rigor and reproducibility, as well as our highly successful grant writing
academy specifically targeted to K award applicants. Our commitment extends well beyond the completion of
the funded period with programs for career development, assistance and advice to ensure our trainees’
success as they enter into full time academic positions. Our aim is to mentor the next more diverse generation
of leaders in myocardial biology. Our obligation extends until our trainees fulfill this goal and beyond."

Millions of Americans living with serious illness experience burdensome symptoms and receive aggressive
care that is not aligned with their goals and preferences. A growing body of evidence suggests that palliative
care, which entails a supportive approach to care focused on maximizing quality of life, improves patient-
centered, clinical, and economic outcomes. For this reason, national guidelines recommend that clinicians
either provide palliative care themselves (primary) or consult experts (specialist) as part of standard serious
illness care. For these reasons, most hospitals in the U.S. have invested in specialist palliative care programs.
Yet, palliative care delivery remains insufficient among patients with serious illness, particularly those with
advanced Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and use of specialist palliative care services
is often inefficient and inequitable, largely due to clinicians' difficulty identifying which patients are most likely to
benefit from them. Many hospitals have begun to implement prognostic triggers in the electronic health record
(EHR) to facilitate more reliable and equitable patient identification, however, none have been rigorously tested
for their effects on patient-centered outcomes. Furthermore, palliative care triggers cannot solely rely on the
limited workforce of palliative care specialists, but rather approaches that promote primary and specialist
palliative care are needed, yet evidence is lacking for how to optimally do so. The main objective of this study
is to evaluate a strategy that combines an EHR-based prognostic-trigger with two effective clinician-directed
nudges to provide either primary or specialist palliative care for seriously ill hospitalized patients. Specifically,
the behavioral intervention involves a simple EHR alert to the primary clinicians caring for identified patients
that requires them to actively choose whether or not to provide primary palliative care, and only if they decline,
a default order for specialist palliative care is entered from which they can opt-out. We will conduct a hybrid
type 1 pragmatic, cluster randomized trial among nearly 7,000 patients across 6 diverse hospitals to study the
intervention's effectiveness on hospital-free days and numerous other patient-centered, clinical, and economic
outcomes. We will also conduct an embedded mixed methods study to understand clinician and hospital
contextual factors that influence the intervention's uptake. Finally, we will evaluate for treatment effect
heterogeneity among patients with ADRD and other pre-specified subgroups to determine which types of
patients derive the greatest benefit from a systematic approach to nudge palliative care. This study will provide
high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of a scalable and sustainable approach to promote
collaborative primary and specialist palliative care among a large and diverse patient cohort, will advance the
science of triggers for palliative care, will provide new insights into the types of patients most likely to benefit
from systematic identification for palliative care, and will create new knowledge about how to establish hospital
environments conducive to desired clinician behavior change to improve serious illness care."

Opioids are potent analgesics, and despite considerable side effects and risks for overdose and addiction,
many patients continue long-term opioid therapy. Based on prior NIDA-funded research (DA040154), we have
published initial data from brain functional MRI (fMRI) studies that demonstrate significantly altered brain
response to reward in patients on long-term opioid therapy. Our preliminary data from innovative high-
resolution fMRI of the cervical spinal cord revealed disrupted resting-state functional connectivity of the spinal
cord dorsal horns in the same patients. Thus, long-term opioid therapy has neurobiological consequences on
responses to stimuli and neural circuitry at both brain and spinal cord levels. Due to the opioid epidemic, there
is an urgent need to understand neurobiological consequences of opioids, as stated in Goal 1 of the NIDA
Strategic Plan, to aid patients and clinicians in opioid cessation strategies, and to inform novel ways to reverse
neurobiological consequences of long-term opioid use. Our overall objective in this project is to characterize
neurobiological consequences of long-term opioid therapy on brain reward systems and spinal cord circuitry, 2
interacting focal points in the central nervous system. Our central hypothesis is that in long-term opioid
therapy patients, opioid use transiently improves responses to stimuli, while disrupting functional
connectivity of neural circuits within the brain and spinal cord. To test this hypothesis, we will collect and
analyze data from task-based and resting-state fMRI of the brain, and high-resolution fMRI of the spinal cord in
long-term opioid users (ie, > 90 days duration, homogeneous sample of female patients with fibromyalgia, as
included in our preliminary data). We will evaluate brain and spinal cord fMRI-based activity in opioid patients
(N = 40) by using a novel within-subject design to compare activity in active vs non-active opioid states (timed
to opioid administration and blood opioid level) to activity in opioid-naïve patients (N = 40) and healthy controls
(N = 40). In Aim 1, we will characterize neurobiological consequences of long-term opioid therapy on brain
fMRI-based response to reward probability, and on resting-state fMRI-based functional connectivity of a key
brain reward circuit. In Aim 2, we will characterize neurobiological consequences of long-term opioid therapy
on spinal cord fMRI-based response to noxious heat stimuli, and on resting-state fMRI-based functional
connectivity between dorsal horns. To identify neurobiological targets related to clinical endpoints of opioid
use/misuse and addiction behavior, exploratory analyses will be integrated across aims to assess relationships
between brain and spinal cord fMRI-based endpoints, and cognitive-affective and clinical measures. Together,
the proposed project will provide important and rigorous opioid dose-timed evidence of neurobiological
consequences of long-term opioid therapy across the central nervous system."
10830963,"Opioid drugs are highly effective analgesics but suffer from serious on-target side-effects. Principle among
these are addition liability and respiratory depression that have led to the current opioid crisis. These effects
together with other actions, including constipation and nausea and vomiting, also reduce the effectiveness of
opioids in the pain clinic. Thus, there is a vital need to develop new analgesics or to improve the clinical
profile of existing medications. Morphine and related opioids exert their effects by acting at the orthosteric
site on the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), i.e. the site where the endogenous opioid peptides bind. Recent
advances in our knowledge of the structure of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have highlighted the
possibility that GPCR function may be controlled by compounds binding at a separate, allosteric, site on the
receptors. In this regard positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that act at MOR (MOR-PAMs) have been
identified. Previous experiments show these compounds act to allosterically modulate the orthosteric site and
so increase the binding affinity, potency and/or maximal response of MOR agonists, including endogenous
opioid peptides, in a probe-dependent manner. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that MOR- PAMs are
effective antinociceptive agents in vivo in the mouse and act by enhancing endogenous enkephalin activity,
thus avoiding the need for opioid drugs such as morphine and oxycodone. This in vivo activity should preserve
the temporal and spatial characteristics of neuronal signaling and so avoid compensatory mechanisms
induced by chronic MOR activation. This application moves the field forward by using structural biology and
computational methods to identify the allosteric binding site on MOR, aided by the development of new
allosteric probes to allow us to more clearly define the mechanism of allosterism, and further exploration of
preliminary findings that allosteric modulators work as effective pain relieving agents in vivo. Detailed
understanding of the actions of allosteric modulators of MOR will provide new information on mechanisms
by which MOR function may be controlled and, together with the identification of high affinity probes, will pave
the way for future drug development efforts of MOR modulators as novel analgesics that safely harness the
analgesic efficacy of MOR without addiction and respiratory depression.

10830964,"ABSTRACT
This collaborative project integrates concepts from engineering, artificial intelligence, computer modeling,
physiology, and clinical cardiology to explore new therapeutic strategies for patients who have heart failure. The
moonshot goal is a simulation framework that can predict how a patient's heart will grow and remodel during a
potential therapeutic intervention. Once the framework has been validated with patient data, it could be deployed
to compare the outcomes predicted for different treatments. A clinician could then use the predictions to guide
their choice of therapy.
This project seeks to advance computational cardiology and move the field closer to a randomized clinical trial
that tests whether patients treated with model-optimized therapies have better outcomes than patients who
received standard clinical care.
The multidisciplinary research team consists of 3 scientists (Ken Campbell, PhD; Jonathan Wenk, PhD; Lik-
Chuan Lee, PhD) and 2 cardiologists (Emma Birks, MD/PhD; Gaurang Vaidya, MD). Together, their skillsets
range from molecular biophysics, through computer modeling and engineering, to clinical care and Ventricular
Assist Devices.
The plan has 3 Aims:
 1) Develop PyMyoVent as a testbed for implementing baroreflex control and myocardial growth.
 2) Use MyoFE to create and validate patient-specific biventricular finite element models that incorporate
 growth and functional remodeling.
 3) Deploy personalized MyoFE models to predict optimal therapies for patients who have heart failure.
The plan is highly innovative reward and makes intelligent use of clinical data collected as part of normal care
from 100 patients who are enrolled in a research registry at the University of Kentucky. These data will include
pressure signals transmitted wirelessly from patients who have had a CardioMEMS device inserted around their
pulmonary artery. Fundamental contributions include the creation of finite element models that are controlled by
a baroreflex and grow and adapt in response to physiological signals including myofilament stress and cellular
energy use."
10830968,"Project Summary
Substance use disorders are increasingly described as highly heritable and brain-based. Preclinical work has
established that deviations in subcortical and frontal networks are associated with progression from
experimentation to use to compulsive drug-seeking, to cycles of abstinence and relapse. Current models
emphasize the importance of genetic vulnerabilities to intermediate phenotypes that predispose to substance
use and dependence, including neural mechanisms of behavioral disinhibition, reward valuation, negative
reinforcement, and negative affect that exacerbates withdrawal/craving. These models also emphasize how such
mechanisms might be differentially impacted as a function of neurodevelopment. These various mechanisms,
their neural correlates and genetic underpinnings, are increasingly being investigated in the context of large
consortium efforts using novel technologies such as the ABCD study, various arms of the Human Connectome
Project, TOPMed, AllofUS, and the UK Biobank, to name a few. However, today’s students are not necessarily
prepared to leverage these resources to advance the field. We propose a mixed predoctoral/postdoctoral training
program, with a central focus on neurobehavioral measures (e.g., neuroimaging), genetically informative
designs, and cutting edge quantitative methods to uncover and characterize neurobehavioral mechanisms in the
development of addiction. The University of Minnesota is a leader in the investigation of behavioral and molecular
genetics of addiction, neurobehavioral mechanisms of substance abuse and its development through the use of
preclinical, pharmacological, and neuroimaging techniques, and in quantitative modeling. Led by co-PDs Luciana
and Vrieze and with the goal of producing the next generation of scientific/academic leaders, the proposed
training program will train six predoctoral and three postdoctoral students each year in quantitative methods and
the genetics and/or neurobehavioral mechanisms of addiction. A diverse group of trainees will be selected using
stringent criteria from the pool of graduate students (predoctoral) as well as nationally (postdoctoral). The
University of Minnesota’s Department of Psychology will lead this effort, with the support of an interdisciplinary
team of 19 mentors in addition to the PDs. Each trainee will be funded for a two-year period, will be co-mentored
by scientists with topical as well as quantitative expertise, and will pursue a combination of didactic training, lab-
based experiences, workshops, seminars focused on professional development, and training in research ethics.
For each trainee, individualized development plans will be developed and reviewed by a Steering Committee
with articulated milestones related to training in specific research methods and the dissemination of findings.
Accordingly, the proposed program will uniquely advance addiction science through its emphasis on
computational/quantitative modeling of genetic and neurobehavioral factors relevant to addiction."
10831498,"Project Summary
In the previous U19 award, we developed a non-genotoxic antibody based method of
conditioning animal recipients for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation.
This approach is now being developed for human use and non-human primate testing by
Magenta Therapeutics, the commercial participant in this proposal. We also developed a
method of enhancing T cell neogenesis post-transplantation that takes advantage of prior work
defining the bone marrow niche for T-competent progenitors, creating an easy to administer, off
the shelf bone marrow cryogel. Subcutaneous injection of the cryogel leads to improved T
competent common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) production, increased thymocytes, TREC+ cells,
mature T cells, expanded TCR repertoire and improved immune function in mouse models.
Here, we will combine it with the gene modification technology of the Cannon and Kiem labs
and the antibody-drug conjugate technology of Magenta to determine whether we can increase
the regeneration of a functionally complex, HIV protected adaptive immune system to protect
against acute HIV infection, control viremia in infected hosts and potentially, reduce the tissue
reservoir of infected cells. The strengths of the Scadden lab in hematopoiesis and transplant
and the Allen lab in HIV infection and immunity will complement each other in testing this
approach in humanized mice. We will closely interact with the Cannnon and Kiem labs on gene
modifying approaches to engineer anti-HIV HSPC and extend testing to the non-human primate.
Collectively, these efforts will provide immediate pre-clinical testing a of a strategy to cure HIV
through low-toxicity approaches to rebuild an infected individual’s immune system."

The Metabolism Core Laboratory at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes
to purchase and install an indirect calorimeter system to support leading research programs in
metabolism, nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic metabolic diseases. Indirect
calorimetry, via a whole-room indirect calorimeter system, is the gold standard for measuring
gas exchange to estimate energy expenditure (EE) via oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production, providing precise and accurate measures under regulated environmental conditions.
UAB has a history of innovation in studies of metabolism utilizing indirect calorimetry and, in the
1990s, was among the first to install an indirect calorimeter in an academic research facility.
This original indirect calorimeter reached the end of its functionality following 20 years of
service, and researchers have been required to shift measurement modalities toward mobile
metabolic monitors or doubly labeled water, both of which have significant limitations relative to
the 24-hour measurement capability of a whole-room indirect calorimeter. Despite these
limitations, multiple NIH-funded investigators have incorporated measures of EE into study
designs, resulting in high-impact scientific studies and publications while demonstrating a
sustained need for the return of whole-room indirect calorimetry capabilities. The room
calorimeter system proposed in this application will meet these research needs and provide a
replacement for the previous system to again enable appropriate, controlled environmental
conditions for both short- and long-term EE measures. Components of daily EE include resting
EE, activity-related EE (both exercise/physical activity and non-exercise activity), thermic effect
of feeding, respiratory exchange ratio (for nutrient substrate utilization), sleeping metabolic rate,
total daily EE, and other measures as required by study designs. While some aspects of these
comprehensive EE measures may be collected via a portable metabolic monitor or doubly
labeled water techniques, effects on EE associated with nutrition composition, timing of feeding,
energy balance, and health and disease states often require the precision and accuracy
available only in the whole-room indirect calorimeter system. Combined with the ability to deliver
interventions (nutrition, activity, pharmaceutical, environmental), the room calorimeter system
will support the current research base and be available to a broad network of investigators
connected to the UAB Nutrition Obesity Research Center, Diabetes Research Center, and
O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center and restore indirect calorimetry capabilities to the state
of Alabama and the broader region, where none currently exist."

10846742,"NIDDK Medical Student Research Program (DK-MSRP): Project Summary/Abstract
The NIDDK created the NIDDK Medical Student Research Program (DK-MSRP) in 2009 to promote exposure
of medical students to research and career pathways involving diabetes, obesity, and metabolism. The NIDDK
asked the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research Center (VDRC) to lead this program because of its experience with a
long-standing medical student research program. This application proposes the next phase of the DK-MSRP
with goals of engaging medical students from around the country in research, exciting them about careers in
discovery, and promoting their career development in ways that promote the NIDDK mission. The DK-MSRP
consists of: 1) A nation-wide application process that informs students from all US medical schools about the
program; 2) Matching of selected students with one of 16 NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers
(DRC); 3) Student-conducted research at an NIDDK-supported DRC 4) Enrichment activities that educate
students about diabetes research and the career paths of physician-scientists; 5) A National Research
Symposium at the end of the summer that allows students to present their work to faculty and other students
and to interact with visiting professors from NIDDK-supported DRCs; 6) A robust program evaluation and
oversight system to guide program improvements; 7) Short and long-term career follow up of student
participants; and 8) Synergy with other NIDDK-funded programs. Since its inception in 2009, 1010 students
from more than 140 medical schools and 45 states and Puerto Rico have conducted mentored research at one
of 16 NIDDK-supported DRCs during the summer between their first and second years of medical school. This
program, with its considerable diversity in geography, ethnicity, and scientific area of research, has become a
way to initiate research exposure for students who might not otherwise pursue this career path. The VDRC and
the DK-MSRP propose these aims and innovations to enhance this important program: 1) Adapt lessons
learned during COVID to provide a robust hybrid / virtual program that complements in-person components
and provides flexibility with changing medical school curricula; 2) Foster outreach to promote diversity for the
DK-MSRP and the future of diabetes research; 3) Continue to develop the DK-MSRP as a means to foster
interactions between NIDDK-supported DRCs through shared training goals, a national lecture series, and the
National Research Symposium; 4) Provide career development coaching to promote networking skills and
long-term mentoring; 5) Use our database to follow student outcomes and aid with next steps in career
development. Thus, the DK-MSRP generates significant enthusiasm about diabetes research and creates
momentum toward a research career and is a key example of NIDDK-supported Diabetes Research Centers
and other NIDDK programs working together to train future leaders."
10846782,"Summary – Project 1
 The development of an accurate assay for plasma HIV-1 RNA provided important insights into HIV-1
pathogenesis and accelerated the development of effective treatments. Co-investigator Alan Perelson used
frequent plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements to demonstrate a biphasic decay in viremia following the initiation of
combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). Following a very rapid initial decay in the first days few days of
treatment, viremia falls more slowly over the new few weeks. The half-lives of these two phases of decay of
viremia (termed here 1st and 2nd phase) are 1 day and 14 days, respectively. Fundamental principles of viral
dynamics2-4 developed by Dr. Perelson suggest that the biphasic decay must reflect the presence of two distinct
populations of virus producing cells with corresponding decay rates 1 day and 14 days. However, this prediction
has yet to be verified. Concomitant measurement of changes in infected cell frequencies following ART initiation
has been complicated by several factors including the presence of large numbers of defective proviruses. The
recent development of digital droplet PCR assays for intact proviruses has allowed us to make such
measurements in persons living with HIV-1 (PLWH) who are initiating ART and in SIV-infected macaques. In
this proposal, we focus on the 2nd phase of decay of viremia which continues for several weeks after the very
rapid 1st phase decay has eliminated most productively infected cells. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the
2nd phase decay represents a selection process which determines which cells will enter the stable latent
reservoir. Only cells that survive this phase of decay may be able to downregulate HIV-1 gene expression and
enter the stable latent reservoir, which we have shown has half-life measured in years (3.7 years). Therefore,
we will analyze 2nd phase decay to develop novel insights into the composition and dynamics of the latent
reservoir that may suggest new strategies for curing HIV-1 infection."
10846783,"Summary – Project 2
Non-human primate (NHP) models have provided valuable insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis, prevention, and
treatment. Of particular importance are models involving infection of rhesus macaques with SIV or SHIV. With
respect to viral reservoirs, we have previously shown that widespread SIV dissemination and reservoir seeding
take place in the first few days of infection. The Barouch lab have also explored cure strategies in rhesus
macaques, focusing on immune stimulating agents, therapeutic vaccination, broadly neutralizing antibodies, and
combinations of these approaches. These studies have provided some promising early evidence of effects on
viral rebound and post-treatment control. The Siliciano lab provided early evidence that latently infected resting
CD4+ T cells in blood, lymph nodes, and spleen are an important reservoir in SIV-infected macaques. Available
studies on reservoir dynamics in SIV-infected macaques suggest an overall similarity to reservoir dynamics in
PLWH. In the studies proposed here, we will capitalize on the advantages of NHP models to explore the
establishment, composition, and dynamics of the latent reservoir. The studies are designed to extend the studies
in PLWH proposed in Project 1 and address critical questions in reservoir dynamics that cannot be easily
addressed in humans. The Specific Aims of this project are:
Specific Aim 1. To define the cell types responsible for the first and second phases of decay of viremia
following initiation of ART. We hypothesize (1) that most of the plasma virus is produced by a rapidly decaying
population of activated CD4+ T cells present in the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues, (2) that the 2nd
phase of decay reflects the elimination of a distinct population of CD4+ T cells in a lower state of activation that
produce virus for a longer period of time, and (3) that the 2nd phase represents selection process that shapes
the composition and dynamics of the stable latent reservoir.
Specific Aim 2. To determine the mechanism by which infected cells are eliminated during the first and
second phases of decay. Using CD8 depletion experiments, we will test the hypothesis that the elimination of
2nd phase cells is mediated by virus-specific CTL."
10846816,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
A large body of evidence indicates that high-quality social relationships are correlated with decreased risk for
morbidity and mortality from a range of disease outcomes, and that social disconnection and poor relationship
quality are correlated with considerable risk for negative health outcomes. Although most of the work in this
area is correlational in nature, it is often interpreted as if it is causal. Genetically informed research methods
can allow researchers to rule-out causal explanations for epidemiological associations and/or identify effects
that may be consistent with a causal influence. Using co-twin control methods and a comprehensive new data
collection in the Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR), this grant brings together a diverse and established
scientific team to examine a series of unanswered questions around social relationships, health, and cognitive
functioning, all of which center on causal inference. The work in this proposal is guided by three Specific Aims
that will: (1) Conduct a detailed assessment of social relationship functioning in the WSTR and use
these variables in co-twin analyses of health and health behaviors. We will conduct a new data collection
on 1,000 adult twin pairs (N = 2,000) in the WSTR and complete a “deep phenotyping” of key relationship
quality variables, including social integration, relationship satisfaction/quality, and attachment styles. Under
Aim 1, we will also collect DNA methylation data and use a series of epigenetic clocks to characterize
accelerated biological aging among our main study outcomes; (2) Conduct a detailed neuropsychological
assessment of cognitive functioning in the WSTR cohort and use these variables as key outcomes in
co-twin models. Social isolation and loneliness may hasten declines in cognitive functioning, but are these
associations consistent with a causal effect? We will conduct detailed neuropsychological assessments of the
2,000 WSTR participants using assessments that target cognitive outcomes shown to be associated with
accelerated cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias; and (3) Examine the association between objective measures of daily social functioning and
the health and cognitive outcomes in the WSTR. The Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) is a
smartphone application that records ambient sounds in participants’ daily lives and provides a means of
assessing social behaviors beyond self-report alone. We will collect EAR data from a sub-sample of 140 adult
MZ twin pairs discordant for marital status (N = 280) from the WSTR to determine if within twin-pair differences
in the objective indices of social integration are associated with the health, health behavior, and cognitive
outcomes. Successful completion of the proposed research will help build a causal foundation for public health
intervention efforts around social relationships."

Copper is an essential micronutrient and a required redox-active cofactor for enzymes necessary for eukaryotic
respiration, oxidative stress resistance, and the production of functionalized cell signaling molecules. Very
recently, Cryptococcus neoformans Bim1 was reported to represent a new class of secreted and cell surface-
associated cuproproteins that promote fungal Cu-uptake via high-affinity CTR Cu-transporters during host
colonization. Homologs to C. neoformans Bim1 are highly represented in the genome of several fungal
pathogens affecting humans, and we identify this new family of Cu-scavenging proteins as Bim1-like proteins
(BLPs). Surprisingly, there is significant sequence diversity at the BLP active site and C-terminal GPI
anchoring domain. Virtually nothing is known on how such sequence variations affect Cu-trafficking function.
Our central hypothesis is that BLP active site variation is used to modulate Cu-binding affinity and oxidation
state specificity, whereas the C-terminal domain partitions BLP proteins at the cell surface. The overall goal of
this research project is two-fold: 1. To understand how the active site diversity within the BLP family affects Cu-
binding properties. 2. To understand how BLP extracellular localization patterns alter cellular Cu-homeostasis.
We propose to use the three BLPs encoded in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus
destructans (Pd) as prototypes for the natural diversity of this new family of extracellular Cu-scavengers. We
will test our hypothesis in the following (2) specific research aims: Aim 1. To determine the impact of BLP
active site variation.; Aim 2. To define the role of Bim1-like protein (BLP) isoforms in extracellular Cu
trafficking. Under the first aim, we will (i) develop a recombinant expression platform to produce wild type and
variant PdBLPs. We will in (ii) determine how active site variation alters the metal-binding properties and the
copper coordination environment. Finally, in (iii) we will determine how active site variation alters Cu-redox
properties. In aim 2, we define the role of BLP isoforms in extracellular Cu trafficking. We will test the
innovative hypothesis that BLPs can partition at the cell surface to relay Cu to the cell surface and boost Cu-
import efficiency. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage the power of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc)
genetics to build a model of the BLP/CTR uptake pathway. In (i-ii) we will optimize the recombinant expression
of PdCTR transporters and PdBLPs in S. cerevisiae. This will involve the rigorous characterization of protein
expression and localization patterns at the plasma membrane and cell wall. In (iii) we will assess the impact of
PdBLP expression levels and extracellular localization in facilitating Cu-import from diffusible and solid
supported Cu sources. The expected outcomes of this work are a basic understanding of how this novel BLP
Cu-uptake pathway functions to ensure adequate delivery of Cu-atoms to fungal pathogens under extremes in
copper bioavailability, akin to that found during host infection."

 This is a submission of a K23 application by Dr. Rakesh Malhotra, MD, MPH, a nephrologist at
University of California San Diego (UCSD). Through this proposal Dr. Malhotra intends to establish himself as
an independent investigator studying non-invasive microvascular measurements in chronic kidney disease
(CKD).
 Candidate: Dr. Malhotra’s training objectives include; 1) to become proficient in the measurement of non-
invasive microvascular techniques and translation to patient-oriented research; 2) to gain expertise in
advanced statistical methods relevant to clinical trials; and 3) to learn the necessary skills to develop an
independent research program and to design and lead clinical trials. Dr. Malhotra will accomplish these
objectives through mentorship, coursework, and participation in workshops. He has assembled a
multidisciplinary team of scientists including Dr. Joachim Ix, an expert clinical trialist (primary mentor), Dr. Boy
Houben, a leader in the field of microcirculation (co-mentor); Dr. Matthew Allison, a leader in the field of
vascular health and assessment (co-mentor) and Dr. Florin Vaida, a PhD level biostatistician (statistical co-
mentor). In addition, Dr. Haiyan Zhang a renal pathologist with experience in nephropathology and Dr. Ithaar
Derweesh a urologist with expertise in minimally invasive surgery will participate as a consultant without pay.
 Research: Renal microcirculation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CKD. The kidney biopsy is
the standard technique to assess abnormalities in renal microvasculature, but is invasive and rarely done. Dr.
Malhotra’s overall hypothesis is that the non-invasive microvascular measurements may improve our
understanding of the renal microcirculation, and improve our ability to identify those at risk of kidney disease
progression. In Aim 1, Dr. Malhotra will evaluate the relationship between non-invasive microvascular
measurements (skin capillary density and % recruitment (by capillaroscopy) and heat-induced skin %-
hyperemia (by laser Doppler)) with glomerular sclerosis among 100 individuals with CKD undergoing kidney
biopsy and 50 persons with CKD undergoing nephrectomy for suspected kidney cancer. In Aim 2a, Dr.
Malhotra will evaluate the association of clinical risk factors with microvascular dysfunction as assessed with
capillaroscopy and laser Doppler among 200 CKD subjects. In Aim 2b, Dr. Malhotra will determine the
associations between skin microvascular function and longitudinal changes in kidney function in the 200 CKD
subjects. Lastly, in Aim 3, Dr. Malhotra will evaluate whether acute changes in % capillary recruitment in
response to a dietary protein load is correlated with concurrent changes in eGFR, as measure of RFR in 20
CKD subjects. Both the training and research plans will lay the groundwork for use of non-invasive
microvascular techniques in clinical trials to allow assessment of renal hemodynamics and monitor responses
to therapies and clinical outcomes in the next and independent phase of Dr. Malhotra’s career."
10847412,"ABSTRACT
 Psychosis exacts a heavy morbidity and mortality toll worldwide, but especially in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs). Psychotic disorders are one of the most common presenting complaints for
individuals admitted to specialty mental health care in many LMICs. Psychotic disorders typically have onset in
early adulthood and a chronic course, meaning patients suffer from many years of poor functionality, disability,
and lost productivity. Indeed, psychotic disorders remain among the 15 leading causes of disability globally.
 Despite the significant toll of psychosis in LMICs, treatment options are extremely limited and
focus heavily on acute, time-limited inpatient stabilization. This focus fails to consider the demonstrated
need for long-term post-acute outpatient treatment and community-based rehabilitation to improve outcomes.
Contextual community factors such as reliable continued access to mental health care, stigma and its negative
impact on medication adherence, inadequate support, and family conflict are key risk factors for subsequent
relapse upon discharge into the community.
 Community-based rehabilitation (CBR) is ideally positioned to address the need for post-acute
community-based care for people with psychosis in low-resource settings. CBR is a general evidence-
based approach for the long-term treatment and support of individuals with a broad range of disabilities. CBR
is particularly well suited for adaptation to address the needs of those with psychosis. CBR aims to improve the
quality of life of individuals living with disability by encouraging understanding of illness, addressing functional
goals, and encouraging social inclusion within their families and communities.
 CBR enables a person-focused emphasis on recovery rather than symptom reduction. Traditionally,
most inpatient and outpatient psychiatric care for people with psychosis focuses on medication management to
reduce negative symptoms. Yet emerging work underscores that a focus on recovery through strengthening
understanding, connection, empowerment, and hope is paramount to optimize long-term quality of life for
individuals with psychosis. Due to its delivery in the home, integration of family members, and focus on
functional goals and social inclusion, CBR is ideally suited to embed this recovery orientation.
 Accordingly, we propose to adapt the CBR model to bring a recovery-focused approach to
addressing the needs of community-dwelling individuals with psychosis in Malawi. We will conduct
formative research with key stakeholders to guide the adaptation of the CBR model and complete a pilot

adapted CBR treatment model. This work will provide a critical advance toward establishing the evidence base
for community-based treatment models for people living with psychosis outside of the context of acute inpatient

The Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) supports a large, worldwide community of scientists using
the insect Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for biomedical experimentation. The goals of the
BDSC are to provide a collection of documented living stocks of broad value to current research, to preserve
documented strains with clear future value, and to provide information and support services that promote
maximal exploitation of these materials. These goals facilitate research by providing universal and rapid
access to the most generally useful stocks by preserving specialty genotypes with exceptional characteristics,
and by providing information that helps researchers identify stocks appropriate to their needs. The genetic
technologies available to Drosophila researchers are among the most sophisticated in any multicellular
organism; consequently, Drosophila is used extensively in studies of biological processes relevant to human
health and investigations of molecular mechanisms underlying disease. As the most comprehensive source of
stocks for genetic experimentation with Drosophila, the BDSC is central to the success of thousands of
research projects and hundreds of NIH grants yearly. The first specific aim of this proposal is to continue
acquiring, maintaining and distributing Drosophila strains while simultaneously eliminating obsolete stocks. The
work will preserve federal investments in genetic resource development by maintaining stocks securely using
regimented practices. It aims to maximize the rigor and reproducibility of genetic studies by encouraging stock
reuse. The second specific aim is to continue developing robust and transparent information resources to meet
the operational needs of the facility and the research needs of Drosophila scientists while maintaining and
promoting excellent user support. The third specific aim is to undertake research to increase the utility of one of
the largest subsets of BDSC stocks, the split-GAL stocks, which were developed to characterize neurons in the
brain. Split-GAL4 transgenes are used to force expression of other transgenes in cell-specific patterns,
allowing investigators to manipulate cell characteristics experimentally in otherwise normal individuals. The
research proposed here aims to characterize the expression of split-GAL4 transgenes outside the brain to
benefit the analysis of diverse cell types and to help distinguish the physiological effects of gene expression in
the brain versus other tissues in split-GAL4 studies. Key to all three aims is the administration and
advancement of the existing, highly successful cost recovery program that finances most operational expenses
from user fees. Consequently, the proposal focuses on support and development of the core management
team as the most effective way to leverage the investment of federal funds."
10843804,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mucosal surfaces are under constant challenge from exposure to environmental or microbial agents. However
the exact nature of interactions between innate immune cells in the regulation of the mucosal barrier is still
poorly understood. This proposal will incorporate a team of investigators with diverse and complementary
expertise to investigate the mechanisms of innate immune cross-talk in the regulation of mucosal barrier
function. The single layer of epithelial cells lining the GI tract is the most fundamental element of the mucosal
barrier while macrophages play a key role in mucosal barrier homeostasis and in immunity to intestinal
pathogens. Previous studies of communication between these intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) have focused on
unidirectional macrophage regulation of epithelial function. However, we believe that this view is overly
simplistic and that a more complex regulatory circuit exists. We hypothesize that bidirectional cross-talk
circuits between epithelial cells and macrophages play a key role in both homeostatic regulation of epithelial
permeability and macrophage polarization. Here, we will investigate the molecular nature of bidirectional cross-
talk circuits between epithelial cells and macrophages with the overall objective to identify how the cell-intrinsic
activity of an essential protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) regulates molecular changes in one cell type,
which can in turn modify the functional capacity of the other. We will test our hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims.
Aim 1 will address how TCPTP modulates the monocyte differentiation continuum and macrophage
polarization status in mucosal homeostasis vs. local inflammation in the intestine. Aim 2 will utilize adoptive
transfer experiments to identify how TCPTP deletion in macrophages vs. IEC modulates intestinal permeability
and antimicrobial responsiveness of both cell types in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3 will identify molecular
mechanisms by which TCPTP regulates how these cell types cross-communicate with each other. We have
established novel mouse lines and in vitro co-culture model systems for this study. We will use these model
systems in a series of innovative and established approaches, to allow us to mechanistically define
phosphatase regulation of these fundamental interactions between macrophages and epithelial cells in the
regulation of mucosal barrier function and macrophage polarization. In addition, we will identify if these cell-
intrinsic phosphatase regulated crosstalk mechanisms apply across species by using mouse and human model
systems. These experiments are foundationally linked to prior work but unequivocally represent an exciting
new direction that synergizes the expertise of the investigative team. The results from these studies are
poised to generate significant advances in our understanding of fundamental basic mechanisms in innate
immunobiology and cellular crosstalk at mucosal surfaces."
10843805,"Abstract: Drugs of abuse are a significant comorbidity among people living with HIV. Methamphetamine
(Meth), in particular, is a potent psychostimulant frequently abused in the HIV/AIDS population. Both HIV and
Meth are risk factors for cognitive decline even in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The
mechanism(s) that drive and/or contribute to this cognitive decline, collectively known as HIV-Associated
Neurocognitive Impairment (HAND), are not entirely clear nor is the impact of Meth on HIV reservoir. Meth itself
enhances HIV replication. We will use two innovative humanized animal models to address the interface between
glial cells, Meth and HIV reservoir. huAstro/HuPBMC mice, generated by engraftment of IPSC-astrocytes into
NSG mice, can uniquely address the role of astrocytes as a reservoir for HIV and in HIV egress out of the brain
to peripheral organs (Aim 1) and define the effect of Meth with or without HIV on prototypical functions of
astrocyte and brain homeostasis (Aim 2). We focus on astrocytes because they constitute a significant resident
brain cell population and perform vital functions to maintain brain homeostasis. The HuCD34/NPC model (CD34
humanized mice engrafted with neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) will be used to assess the role of Meth on HIV
evolution over time in the CNS and peripheral organs (Aim 3). Combining these two models with the resources
of the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC) and the NIDA center for genetic studies
at Rutgers and cell repository (RUDCR) to reprogram lymphocytes from Meth/HIV donors to generate IPSC then
NPC and/or IPSC-astrocytes as targeted for in vitro and in vivo studies provides a powerful tool to address our
central hypothesis that Meth mediates a greater HIV reservoir in astrocytes and egress into peripheral organs
(Aim 1), dysregulate astrocytes to disrupt brain homeostasis (Aim 2), and promote s greater extent of viral
evolution within the CNS (Aim 3). Together, these studies are responsive to NIDA HIV research high priority
areas and will advance our knowledge regarding the role of drugs of abuse on HIV reservoir, evolution, and
neuropathogenesis to inform better strategies to uniquely address persistent HIV among the HIV positive drug
abusing population."
10843901,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Based on animal and limited human data, sleep disruption has been linked to decreased clearance and
increased production of b-amyloid and tau, proteins which in their aggregated forms represent the two
hallmark pathologies seen in Alzheimer’s disease. A number of different sleep parameters have also been
closely tied to memory consolidation and chronic sleep disruption increases the risk of memory impairment in
older individuals. However, despite data linking sleep disruption to Alzheimer’s disease pathology and
memory impairment, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how sleep disruption evolves over the
course of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and what aspects of sleep may be targets for intervention. In this
context, we propose to directly examine the evolution of sleep disruption in relation to the in vivo progression
of tau pathology, cognitive decline, and network dysfunction. Leveraging data that suggest that tau
accumulation may be quite rapid during prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, we will focus these studies on
individuals with MCI. We hypothesize that disrupted sleep architecture will be closely related to increased
neocortical tau pathology and cognitive impairment, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Further, we
hypothesize that sleep disruption leads to diminished connectivity in brain networks previously linked to
memory performance and cognitive decline, and that this network dysregulation may partially mediate the
effects of sleep disruption on cognition. Together, these studies will improve understanding on mechanistic
links between sleep, cognition, and Alzheimer’s disease. More broadly, the data from these studies will
critically inform the design of interventional studies modifying sleep in early Alzheimer’s disease by identifying
which specific aspects of disrupted sleep are most closely tied to b-amyloid and tau pathology (potential
therapeutic targets), assessing which aspects of sleep change over time in MCI, and the extent to which
longitudinal polysomnography and actigraphy can measure aspects of sleep disruption relevant to Alzheimer’s
disease."
10843903,"It is estimated that Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will
surpass cancer as the second leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the
leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB),
Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD), and Fronto-temporal dementia. There is an urgent, unmet
need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages
of the pathophysiological process. To address this, Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) is leveraging
day/night assessment technologies to create the Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler
for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer’s and other
dementias. The components of the platform are the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep
Profiler (SP), and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure cloud-based,
infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, & reporting. AMP is unique among
neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one that integrates advanced electrophysiological
measures (e.g., 24-channel wireless EEG/ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive
tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. This capability
permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive
functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. The SP is FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that
was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental
EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics
of REM-sleep behavior disorder, considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. The
application of machine-learning, classification algorithms streamlines the processing and analyses of
these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia subtypes. The
overarching goal of the current submission is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based
infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and SP, train classification algorithms to
discriminate among Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and
integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. The INSPECDS system is the first
clinical research tool of its kind with application in both university-based research settings and
pharmaceutical clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer’s disease and other
dementias."
10842090,"Genetic analysis in model organisms such as C. elegans continues to excel as a fundamental approach to
discovering how cells, tissues, and organs communicate with each other to control development, and to
identifying the signaling components, modulators and mechanisms that govern these processes. Aberrant
activity of these same signaling pathways has profound effects on human health, most notably causing cancer,
congenital defects, and diverse physiological disorders. Regulating signaling appropriately—in space or cell
population, in time, strength or duration, or in combination with other signaling inputs—is thus crucial both for
normal development and for understanding human disease, and is the overarching theme of the proposed work.
 Much of the proposed work concerns Notch, a transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor in cell-
cell interactions that control development in all animals. Our overall goal is to elucidate the regulatory logic and
mechanisms that regulate Notch activity and that coordinate its activity with other highly conserved major
signaling systems to ensure precise and robust cell fate outcomes. C. elegans is amenable to combining
traditional genetic analysis with genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 to apply many different methods for
manipulating and visualizing endogenous genes and their products. These tools, combined with genetically-
encoded signaling biosensors, cell-specific transcriptome profiling, and long-term imaging, allow for
unprecedented insight and resolution into signaling regulation and integration.
 Our proposed work will fill three Key Gaps for which we performed foundational work during the current
funding period. Key Gap 1 addresses questions about the mechanism by which ligands activate Notch signal
transduction, arising from our recent discovery of unexpected evolutionary plasticity in the force-dependent
mechanism of Notch activation. Our investigations in this area may prove to be relevant to specific mammalian
contexts and to suggest novel strategies for modulating ligand-Notch interactions in clinically-relevant settings.
Key Gap 2 concerns a universal feature of animal development, ""lateral inhibition"" or ""lateral specification."" In
this process, Notch-mediated interactions between initially equivalent cells engage feedback loops that amplify
a stochastic, small initial difference between them to resolve their fates. New tools we developed during the
current funding period will allow us to delve deeper into the stochastic events and feedback mechanisms in an
archetypal case of lateral specification, the Anchor Cell/Ventral Uterine precursor cell fate decision during
gonadogenesis. Key Gap 3 concerns how developmental progression of different organs is coordinated, as is
necessary to ensure coherent development. We will build on our findings of inter-organ signaling mediated by
conserved pathways that control development of the reproductive system. The overall impact of pursuing these
areas of investigation will be a greater understanding of fundamental mechanisms mediated by conserved
signaling pathways relevant to human development and disease."
10838175,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Microtubules are critical for nearly every function of eukaryotic cells, from their ability to divide
and move to their ability to adopt specific morphologies and withstand mechanical forces.
Microtubule assembly, dynamics, and functions are dictated and regulated by a large number of
cellular factors including microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors in the
kinesin and dynein superfamilies. Our overall goal is to define the mechanisms by which
microtubules and kinesin motor proteins drive intracellular trafficking in mammalian cells.
Unresolved questions include: What are the motility and force-generating properties of different
kinesins that enable them to perform specific motor functions in cells? How are posttranslational
modifications of tubulin subunits within a subset of microtubules recognized as “road signs” for
kinesin-based trafficking? What is the fate of the motor at the end of its journey i.e., is it
degraded or recycled? What effect does motor stepping have on the microtubule lattice? To
address these questions, we will combine biophysical and biochemical methods that provide
mechanistic detail on motor mechanics and motility with cellular assays that report on regulation
and function within the complex cellular environment. As defects in microtubules and kinesin
motors are linked to developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, these
studies will advance our understanding of their functions in cell biology and disease."
10844211,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal focuses on the study of IgG4-related disease in part to obtain insights about the
underlying mechanisms that specifically initiate and help maintain this disease. However, the
broader goal is to leverage unusual and “advantageous” aspects of this disease to gain broader
insights about the underlying principles and mechanisms that potentially lead to the initiation
and maintenance of many human autoimmune disorders, in a more general sense. The
indolent nature of IgG4-related disease is a factor behind why patients are typically initially seen
in an untreated state. The dramatic response to B cell depletion therapy allows easy follow-up
up to and at the time of remission and the regular systematic follow up of patients allows us to
investigate these patients as they relapse many months later. Sequential analyses will be
performed sequentially on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum and on the stool (for
microbiome). We will use Protein arrays, ELISAs and Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems
assays to help categorize patients according to their auto-antibody profiles, identify antigen
specific B cells and use overlapping peptides to identify memory T cells against self-antigens
that induce T-B collaboration and potentially drive the initial disease and the relapse. Potential
cross-reactivity of microbial peptide specific CD4+ T cell for self-antigens will also be assessed.
Tissue interrogation approaches that incorporate systems biology tools will be used to examine
disease end organs to better understand immune mechanisms that drive fibrosis, and when
possible draining lymph nodes, to attempt to understand immune dysregulation events that may
help initiate the disease."

early-onset
mutations in human ENPP1 results in aberrant soft tissue and skeletal mineralization disorders,
Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets (ARHR2) Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal
(OPLL), and Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI) in homozygous deficiency, and
osteoporosis (EOOP) in
,
ENPP1 haploinsufficiency. ENPP1 deficienct patients therefore exhibit
paradoxical mineralization, with concurrent low bone mass and progressive calcifications in kidneys, tendons,
and vasculature. Paradoxical mineralization is also present in the general medical population in aging patients,
and in patients with chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Fracture risk and high
mortality in CKD-MBD patients has not changed in the last 20 years despite significant progress in other
skeletal disorders, illustrating continued serious limitations in the understanding and treatment of CKD-MBD.
The study of ENPP1 deficiency and its inherent paradoxical mineralization, will serve to identify and validate
signaling pathways by which ENPP1 regulates bone mass; we strongly believe that this approach will inform
longstanding issues hampering our understanding of paradoxical mineralization, enabling better therapeutic
agents for these patients.
ENPP1 is the only human enzyme which generates PPi, a strong inhibitor of accrual of bone mineral in the
extant bone matrix. One would anticipate, therefore, that disorders inducing low PPi would result in increased
bone mass and volume, and not the low bone mass observed in humans and mice. Therefore, the mechanism
by which ENPP1 induces low bone mass is not apparent based on an understand of the enzyme's catalytic
activity alone. In response to this paradox, we hypothesize the presence of catalytically independent ENPP1
signaling pathways regulating mammalian bone mass. This proposal seeks to (a) establish the pathways
involved, (b) define the catalytically dependent and independent genetic and protein signal transduction
pathways by which ENPP1 regulates bone mass, and (c) quantitate their effect on bone fragility,
microarchitecture, and growth, as well as on biomarkers associated with bone mineralization. To accomplish
these Aims, we will use novel animal models which uncouple ENPP1 protein signaling from ENPP1 catalysis
and novel and proprietary biologics we have designed and engineered to activate ENPP1 catalytic and
catalytic-independent signaling in vivo. The investigative team has a strong history of success as evidenced by
several recent publications supporting the overall hypothesis, the specific aims, and the bench to bedside
development of a novel biologics treating GACI and ARHR2 that have entered the clinic, thus validating the
scientific rigor, experimental approach, and scientific impact of this proposal."
10843890,"Approximately one-fifth of the world’s couples encounter fertility problems posing physical and emotional health
issues. While half of the infertility problems are attributed to the male, insufficient knowledge of sperm
physiology prohibits proper diagnosis in roughly 50% of these cases. A key aspect of fertilization involves
capacitation, a sperm maturation step within the female reproductive tract. In this step, the sperm acquires the
capacity to fertilize an egg, but many aspects of capacitation are still largely unknown. Our long-term goals are
to identify and characterize the mechanisms that regulate sperm capacitation. A key player in the capacitation
process is the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), an enzyme that efficiently synthesizes cAMP when exposed to
bicarbonate and intracellular calcium. When sAC is activated, cAMP levels increase causing the sperm-specific
CatSper channel to open, allowing calcium to flow from the extracellular medium into the flagellum. So, how
does calcium initially reach sAC for its activation when CatSper is not yet active? Previous reports show that in
CatSper-null mice, cAMP levels can increase similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting that the initial calcium
influx does not occur as result of CatSper activation. Our preliminary data show that the initial calcium flow
indeed takes place in a CatSper-independent manner. Once sAC is activated, it remains active during the
whole capacitation process through an unknown regulation. Our preliminary data place Cdc42, a protein known
to control multiple cellular functions at the heart of this sAC regulation. While Cdc42 is expressed in
mammalian sperm, its role in this cell is unclear. Our central hypothesis is that sAC is differentially regulated to
allow both the initial activation that triggers capacitation and maintenance of sufficient cAMP levels throughout
the process. Aim 1 will identify a novel mechanism for the initial activation of sAC. Our hypothesis is that the
calcium required for the activation of sAC is delivered by ion channels present in the sperm head. Aim2 will
determine the role of Cdc42 on the activation of sAC during capacitation. Our hypothesis is that Cdc42 is
essential for cAMP production by sAC in the vicinity of the CatSper complex. These two aims will be achieved
by using super-resolution imaging to probe the localization of molecules within the flagellum, flow cytometry to
assess the activity of signaling molecules at the single-cell level, and patch clamp electrophysiology to
measure calcium currents. In addition, transgenic lines will enable us to abrogate CatSper channels and Cdc42
activity. The outcomes from this work will shed light on the initial activation of sAC, will identify the calcium
channel responsible for the first calcium influx during capacitation, and will elucidate the mechanism by which
sAC remains active in the same region of the CatSper signaling domain. We expect these fundamental
capacitation studies will open new avenues to find treatments of male infertility and aid in the development of
non-hormonal contraceptives."
10843891,"ABSTRACT
Despite many years of discussion, research, and efforts to promote change, a great disparity remains between
the presence of African American, Hispanic, Native American, People with Disabilities, and other
underrepresented minority (URM) faculty at US research universities and their representation in the US
population. This reality is no less true in the neurosciences than in other disciplines. Moreover, URMs who do
achieve faculty status appear to achieve traditional measures of success at a lower rate than do their majority
counterparts. Although data on publications and funding rates appear to be lacking, there is a striking absence
of URMs in visible positions of prominence as full professors or chairs at universities and as symposia
speakers, journal editors, or societal officers. We believe that these two problems are related – that if those
URMs who are faculty become more successful in regard to those measures, this in turn will stimulate an influx
of other URMs into faculty ranks. Our evaluation of available programs in the US indicates that there are
limited opportunities to adequately assist early career URM faculty in overcoming these difficulties, and it is this
problem that we seek to address through the Mentoring Institute for Neuroscience Diversity Scholars (MINDS)
to promote the advancement of junior faculty members in the neurosciences at research universities. Defining
success for such faculty in terms of quality and quantity of manuscripts, grants submitted, and funded, visibility
at the national level, mentoring of others by the participants, and promotion, we propose to establish a program
based on the following hypothesis: The success of early career URM faculty in neuroscience can be increased
substantially by an intensive individualized educational program focused on (1) and individualized career
development plan and the identification of a team of relevant mentors (2) strong instruction in professional
skills and the responsible conduct of research (RCR), (3) individualized and frequent mentoring by senior
established faculty (4) development of an expanded network and peer-mentoring, and (5) the promotion and
enhancement of the career of URM faculty at their own institutions. To test this hypothesis we will continue the
MINDS program to advance the development of URM faculty. We will recruit 10 early career URM faculty in
neuroscience each year who have great promise for success. We will then develop career development
programs for each participant and together the participant and mentoring team will develop a career
development plan. To facilitate that plan we will establish a two-year educational program consisting of (a)
workshops, (b) strong mentoring, (c) attendance at professional scientific meetings, (d) assistance in the
expansion of their network, and (e) mechanisms to promote communication and peer-mentoring among the
participants. The impact of our efforts will be evaluated and the results disseminated at meetings and in
publications. We believe that this approach will have a significant impact on the success of early career URM
faculty in the neurosciences and will serve as a model for programs in other areas of academia."
10843900,"ABSTRACT: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasing health problem in people with
HIV (PWH), and mechanisms of HIV COPD are poorly understood. Translocation of microbes or microbial
products into the circulation as a result of increased mucosal permeability occurs in HIV, stimulates systemic
inflammation, and has been linked to end-organ damage. Studies have largely focused on translocation of
bacteria from the gut. We and others find that fungal translocation, defined by detection of 1,3-beta-D-glucan
(BDG), occurs in PWH in the absence of invasive fungal infection. BDG is a pathogen-associated molecular
pattern and fungal cell wall component that activates immune cells and triggers inflammation, and high
systemic BDG levels correlate with circulating immune mediators in PWH and uninfected populations. Our
preliminary data show that BDG is associated with worse lung function in HIV. In vitro, BDG increases lung
epithelial and immune cell expression of inflammatory mediators, suggesting that BDG contributes directly to
disease pathogenesis. While these data support a role of fungal translocation in HIV COPD, we do not know
how BDG if circulating BDG is tied to epithelial disruption, how it relates to the host fungal microbiome, or how
BDG leads impacts lung function. Here, we test the hypotheses that circulating BDG in HIV (1) originates from
the lung fungal mycobiome in the setting of impaired lung permeability, (2) predicts worse respiratory
symptoms and function, and (3) leads to impaired lung function via effects on circulating leukocytes. Using our
established Pittsburgh HIV Lung cohort and in vitro lung modeling, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To
assess the relationship between gut and lung epithelial barrier integrity, the fungal mycobiome, and circulating
BDG levels in PWH. We test the hypothesis that circulating BDG originates in the lung as well as the gut by
assessing intestinal and lung permeability with functional assays and epithelial injury biomarkers and plasma
BDG. We will also analyze fungal communities of the aerodigestive tract and circulating fungal DNA. Aim 2: To
investigate if higher circulating BDG levels predict disease progression and systemic immune cell activation in
HIV COPD. We will test the hypothesis that PWH with higher BDG levels have worse lung function and
respiratory morbidity over time and that BDG is related to lung function and immune activation. Aim 3. To
determine if BDG causes lung inflammation via dectin-1 in circulating immune cells from PWH. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that the primary effect of BDG is from stimulation of inflammation in PBMCs
by the dectin-1 receptor with increased magnitude of biological impact in the setting of HIV and will use
combinations of BDG, conditioned media from HIV+ PBMCs, transwell insert culture models of well-
differentiated human airway epithelial cells, and state-of-the-art Human Lung Small Airway-on-a-Chip. These
studies investigate an entirely novel paradigm of HIV-associated pulmonary disease, identify novel therapeutic
targets and biomarkers, and improve care of HIV+ individuals."

10847786,"ABSTRACT
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s occur upon exposure of cells to ionizing radiation and chemicals in the
environment, and when DNA replication forks become impeded by lesions and obstacles then
subsequently collapse. Two mechanistically distinct DSB repair pathways, namely, homology-directed
repair (HDR) and non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ), are responsible for the removal of the majority
of DSBs. Whereas HDR is mostly accurate, NHEJ, while efficient, often entails loss of DNA sequence
during repair, and can also generate chromosome translocations and replication fork fusions. Failure of
NHEJ or HDR leads to heightened engagement of alternate end-joining (AltEJ) and single-strand annealing
(SSA), highly mutagenic and otherwise minor pathways, as repair tools. As such, the choice of DSB repair
pathway has a major impact on the maintenance of genome stability, preventing neoplastic transformation
of cells, and oncogenesis. Our Program Project brings together seven leading NIH-funded laboratories
within a highly collaborative and synergistic realm to delineate the mechanisms of HDR and replication fork
maintenance, and how HDR is negatively regulated to favor the use of NHEJ as DSB repair tool. We have
assembled three Shared Resource Cores to provide state-of-the-art services in the production of high
quality protein preparations for mechanistic experiments, biophysical and structural analyses of protein-
ligand interactions and precise measurement of binding constants, and also cellular analyses of DSB repair
and replication fork maintenance. Altogether, we are exceptionally well poised to leverage our deep
knowledge of DSB repair mechanisms and leadership to understand how the tumor suppressors BRCA1-
BARD1 and BRCA2 function to promote HDR and to overcome the HDR restrictive action of the epigenetic
mark reader 53BP1 and its associated factors such as DYNLL1 and the hetero-trimeric CTC1-STN1-TEN1
complex. As such, our Program Project will not only exert a major impact in elucidating mechanisms of
DSB repair pathway choice and cancer drug resistance, but will also identify novel targets and pathways
pivot points to guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat incalcitrant breast, ovarian and
other cancers."

This proposal seeks funding for the seventh cycle of our training program in Pathophysiology and Rehabilitation
of Neural Dysfunction (PRND). The program is based at Northwestern University, in close collaboration with the
Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. It is directed by Dr. Eric Perreault, PhD, and co-directed by Drs. Levi Hargrove, PhD,
Lee Miller, PhD and Elliot Roth, MD. Trainees will be mentored by 26 highly collaborative and productive
scientists from seven departments in engineering and medicine. This group has broad expertise relevant to the
pathophysiology and rehabilitation of neural dysfunction, ranging from cellular neurophysiology to the
engineering of novel techniques, materials, and machines, to clinical implementation. Over the life of this
program, 49 predoctoral fellows, 36 postdoctoral fellows, and 17 summer interns have been supported
financially, and more than 200 others have benefitted from our T32 activities. Most trainees remain in academia,
and many are now established leaders in rehabilitation medicine. Our mission is to train prospective researchers
from engineering and the basic sciences to perform research on fundamental mechanisms underlying disabling
neurological illness, to guide the development of clinically meaningful tools for quantifying and relieving the
severity and impact of neurologic illness, and to pursue research on the effects of rehabilitation interventions on
disabling illnesses. Our training begins with a clinical experience centered on the patient, thereby providing
context for future research. The clinical experience is supplemented by scientific training in the mechanisms of
neurological dysfunction, information on technology transfer from the laboratory to the patient, and several
professional and network development activities to prepare our trainees for a productive career in rehabilitation
science. In this renewal application, we aim to build on our past achievements and increase our impact through
enhancements that will broaden the community of scientists we reach, refine the clinical experience we provide,
increase the rigor of our inquiry, and strengthen the professional development opportunities facilitating the
transition from trainee to independent scientist. We propose to train three predoctoral fellows, three postdoctoral
fellows and two summer interns. This is an increase of one postdoctoral fellow and one intern over our current
levels, reflecting growth in our research capacity. Predoctoral trainees will be selected from the rich pool of
applicants in the participating engineering departments (Biomedical, Computer Science, Materials Science, and
Mechanical). Postdoctoral fellows will be selected from these same departments, and from the medical
departments of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences, and
Physiology. All participants will complete two years of training. By integrating the proposed innovations with the
successful practices already in place, we expect to continue advancing the science and practice of rehabilitation
medicine by training the next generation of interdisciplinary leaders."

 The Professional Development and Education (PDE) Core promotes a culture of research at the 
Baccalaureate Partner Institutions (BPIs) by: a) working with network faculty at our Baccalaureate Partner 
Institutions (BPIs) to help them become competitive for extramural funding and b) integrating into the college 
curricula undergraduate research in order to inspire a diverse group of students to gain experience and enter 
biomedical careers. Given the heavy teaching loads of VGN's funded BPI faculty and their isolation from 
colleagues working on related research projects, the Core's programmatic activities are critical to bridging this 
gap and encouraging publications, grant proposal submissions, and undergraduate student involvement in 
research. 
 The PDE Core helps to facilitate the state's culture of research by supporting network faculty research 
through trainings in grant writing, mentoring including the creation of Individual Development Plans, assistance 
with the development of technical skills, the formation of thematic research groups and integration of research 
into the classroom. In addition, the PDE Core provides a robust program of mentored research opportunities 
to undergraduate students at the Baccalaureate Partner Institutions through internships. Students present their 
VGN-funded research at an annual Career Day event where STEM professionals share their experiences with 
the student attendees. The PDE Core also collaborates with our two Outreach Partners to extend summer 
research opportunities for their diverse undergraduates. 
 The PDE Core integrates research and education support to BPI faculty with the other VGN Core 
Facilities and along with the Administrative Core will monitor the development and growth of the culture of 
research at the BPIs."

The overall mission of the Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) core at Roswell Park
is to develop the next generation of cancer research professionals through coordinated implementation of
rigorous educational programs across the training continuum. Consistent with Roswell Park's mission, all CRTEC
education and training programs are cancer-focused. CRTEC is responsible for a comprehensive educational
and training portfolio that includes immersive cancer research experiences for K-12 students, a long-standing
(65+ years) summer internship program for high school, college and medical students, new nurse residency and
nursing scholars program, graduate programs in the Cancer Sciences, postdoctoral training, and oncology-
focused residency and fellowship programs. CRTEC also coordinates a faculty mentoring program and career
development activities to enhance academic productivity and promote a healthy work-life balance. CRTEC
activities are integrated with the cancer center’s mission, informed by our catchment area needs and designed
with a strong commitment to building diversity, equity and inclusion. A combination of sustained institutional
commitment, CCSG-support for research programs and shared resources and a pool of experienced faculty
mentors enable successful delivery of these training programs. Working closely with the Offices of Community
Outreach and Engagement (COE) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), CRTEC will continue to develop
and implement K-12 cancer educational programs prioritizing diversity. In collaboration with DEI, CRTEC will
facilitate recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority (URM) faculty through culturally responsive
faculty mentoring programs and CCSG/cancer center leadership pipelines. We will continue to measure key
productivity and engagement metrics including programmatic reach, equity and opportunities for improvement
based on trainee and mentor feedback for all CRTEC activities to ensure successful training experiences."
10848667,"The overarching goal for Roswell Park's Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) component is to promote and sustain
inclusive training, hiring, and career development processes using diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) best
practices. We will achieve this through purposeful and intentional assessment, program planning, resource
allocation, and evaluation activities to optimize and enhance the center's DEI infrastructure. Roswell Park
leadership has committed to a purpose driven strategic partnership approach to align and sustain DEI activities
and best practices across the organization. Broadly, our PED plan will enhance and expand infrastructure to
increase participation of women and individuals from groups historically underrepresented in the research
workforce, which includes trainees, faculty, research staff, and center leadership. Our specific aims cover the
priority areas identified in our PED logic model and address structural factors (e.g., cancer center infrastructure
and environment) and institutional level mechanisms (e.g., workforce development, pipeline programs, faculty
recruitment and retention) in a complementary manner. The PED team is collaborating with organizational
partners to implement DEI best practice strategies to mitigate bias and improve climate across the educational
and professional continuum extending to cancer care delivery.
Roswell Park's Plan to Enhance Diversity is driven by three aims: 1) Enhance diversity in faculty and center
leadership; 2) Enhance the educational, mentoring, and training infrastructure to support participation from
diverse and underrepresented populations; and 3) Develop and implement criteria for monitoring and evaluating
progress in diversity to support sustainability of diversity, equity, and inclusion best practices. This PED
component is led by Elisa M. Rodriguez, PhD, MS, serving as the inaugural Associate Director (AD) of DEI
since August 2022. Dr. Rodriguez is an Associate Professor, Population Sciences program member, and former
Chief Diversity and Equity Officer for Faculty, which provided valuable insight for the AD of DEI role.
The DEI office and PED component work together to support a holistic DEI approach across the cancer center

10848668,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Cancer cells can overcome stress caused by intense, deregulated replication, and can survive, and even thrive,
in the adverse, stressful conditions of the tumor microenvironment. Stress responses are also induced by
cytotoxic cancer therapies (e.g., photodynamic, radiation therapy) and the inflammation which arises during anti-
tumor immune responses. New research is revealing that systemic stress, mediated by a neuro-immune-tumor
axis can contribute significantly to tumor progression may thereby link psychological stress such as anxiety in
patients, to molecular signaling pathways and immunosuppression. The Mission of the Cancer Stress Biology
(CSB) program is to provide a platform for interactive study of stress at these multiple levels so that we can more
completely understand the impact of stress in cancer. The unifying goal of members of the CSB program is to
apply knowledge regarding stress to improve cancer treatment and quality of life, and also to better understand
how stress can affect different populations, including those resulting in cancer disparities. The program is led by
Elizabeth Repasky PhD and Anurag Singh MD, who bring complimentary expertise in basic/translational
laboratory research and clinical research and brings together 34 individuals (including 8 new and early-stage
investigators) from 13 Departments at Roswell Park. Specific Aims of CSB are: 1) Decipher the impact of
tumor cell-intrinsic molecular stress pathways. 2) Identify and characterize stress responses generated
within the tumor ecosystem and organism. and 3) Evaluate the role of stress as a modifiable risk factor
in cancer patients and develop novel therapies that target stress pathways.
The program received a score of Outstanding to Excellent in the 2018 review and since then has significantly
increased its high impact publications (26% compared to 10% in 2018), peer-reviewed grant funding ($10.9M
compared to $5.3M in 2018) and its accruals to clinical trials (312 vs 53 in 2018) that includes a substantial
increase in investigator-initiated interventional trials arising from CSB science. Moreover, we have significantly
increased our team science around several overlapping research themes which include replication/epigenetic
stress, metabolic and adrenergic stress, radiation, and photo/UV induced stress. CSB faculty are focused on
research responsive to COE community-identified needs and priorities with a strong focus on research that
examines the basic and translational mechanisms linking the social determinants of health to cancer outcomes,
a COE priority area. The CSB Program has benefited from use of all Shared Resources and support from Roswell
Park. CSB faculty actively partners with CRTEC, with the objective to train the next generation of scientists in
cancer stress biology. With a strong funding and faculty base and sustained collaborations inside/outside our
Center, CSB is at the forefront of understanding the role of stress in cancer development and developing novel
therapeutics to counteract the effects of stress on cancer disparity and treatment responses."

The overall objective of the “Kansas Institute for Precision Medicine” (KIPM) COBRE Center at the University of
Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) is to advance the customization of healthcare through promoting innovative
scientific discoveries. We have entered the era of Precision Medicine, an initiative recently announced as part of
the 21st Century Cures Act, which is focused on using the molecular basis of diseases to better match patients
with the appropriate therapies and care resulting in improved outcomes. To advance this mission, we have
established the Biobanking and Biomarker Validation (BBV) Core, which combines exceptional expertise and
expands essential resources within established infrastructure, i.e., Biobanking - Biospecimen Repository Core
Facility (BRCF) and Biomarker Validation - Biomarker Discovery Laboratory (BDL). Access to the BBV core will
strengthen the biomedical research capacity of our COBRE Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot Project
Leaders (PPLs) by enhancing their research base and infrastructure capacities. To advance precision medicine
research within this Phase 2 COBRE program, the BBV core will 1) expand the services and infrastructure offered
by the BBV Core; 2) build a business strategy for the BBV Core that contributes to its long-term sustainability;
and 3) facilitate the competitiveness of KIPM COBRE RPLs and other faculty in securing external funding. The
BBV core is designed to centralize these essential services that will in turn provide support to the KIPM COBRE
faculty, pilot grantees, and researchers within our region and beyond. Given the level of sophistication of the
materials and services required for the range of studies proposed within the KIPM COBRE, a highly integrated
BBV core is not only cost effective but an absolute necessity. The BBV core eliminates redundant infrastructure
and expense required for each researcher to develop their own capabilities or to search for the necessary
research expertise. The BBV core will enable multiple COBRE RPLs and future pilot grantees, access to state-
of-the-art facilities and laboratory expertise, thereby further reducing the relative cost of their studies.
Furthermore, the BBV core will continue to provide in-kind technical staff-support and biobanking services, which
help the KIPM COBRE faculty to utilize their available funding more effectively, both institutional startup and
KIPM COBRE support. However, to remain sustainable the BBV Core will implement additional plans, including
an operational business strategy, to ensure its longevity persists. The success of the BBV core and ultimately
the COBRE faculty is essential to advancing the mission of the KIPM to advance the customization of healthcare
through promoting innovative scientific discoveries."
10848669,"The overarching goal of Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Program is to develop and translate novel
mechanism-driven anticancer therapeutics and therapeutic combinations. To accomplish this goal, Program
members conduct convergent and impactful scientific research that aims to: 1) uncover new cancer
vulnerabilities and develop novel therapeutics and combinations; 2) understand and overcome therapy
resistance; and 3) facilitate clinical translation of program-developed drugs and therapeutic strategies through
innovative clinical trials. To catalyze the realization of our Aims, DT Program pursues two other important
missions. First, DT Program is fully integrated with our Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) component
to address the etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying the major health disparities in COE-prioritized
cancers and ensure incorporation of community perspectives into our program research. Second, by actively
engaging in all facets of education and mentoring coordinated through the CRTEC (Cancer Research Training
and Education Coordination) Core, DT Program emphasizes mentoring junior members, and educating and
training the next generation of basic and clinician scientists to develop expertise across the continuum of
anticancer therapeutic development with a diverse and inclusive team.
 DT Program is co-led by Dr. Dean Tang, an expert on studying (cancer) stem cells, cancer heterogeneity
and plasticity, and therapy resistance, and Dr. Igor Puzanov, an expert on conducting clinical trials with an
emphasis on combining immune and targeted agents. With complementary expertise, the Program leaders work
together to define priorities for Institutional investment, strengthen Program science by promoting intra- and inter-
programmatic collaborations, and foster Program development via retreats, the bi-weekly DT seminar series,
monthly Faculty Grant Forum, and Program funding mechanisms that emphasize COE and cancer disparities.
 The DT Program presently has 42 members from 10 departments. In the current funding cycle, DT Program
members demonstrated synergistic and significantly increased productivity in basic discovery and translational
and clinical cancer research. The high impact of DT Program research is best evidenced by the quality of our
members' publications: 28% are in high-impact (JIF≥10) journals compared to 9% in 2018. Further, the direct
peer-reviewed funding in DT Program has substantially increased from $5.58M (40% from NCI) in 2018 to
$12.88M (78% from NCI) as of 3/31/2023. Notably, 78% of the members have peer-reviewed funding and DT
Program has seen significant increases in team science, health disparity focused and mentored/training grants.
Also, the Program-related clinical trial accruals have been steady and strong with a slight increase (from 346 in
2018 to 399 in 2022). Finally, DT members have contributed to the CCSG mission by not only conducting
impactful science and winning competitive grant support but also providing leadership as Shared Resource
Directors, TRG (Translational Research Group) Directors, Faculty Mentors, and leaders in education."
10849364,"ABSTRACT
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, scarring lung disease that, while rare, significantly impacts
survival for patients. The time to death from diagnosis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients is worse than
most solid cancers (except lung and pancreas). Despite the impact of this condition, treatments only slow
progression of the scarring in the lung and have yet to be able to impact survival or quality of life. The only “cure”
for IPF remains lung transplantation, which has a 50% survival at 5-years despite the significant medical
resources required. These patients need new therapies and deserve a better understanding of the disease to
inform clinical practice. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify novel mechanisms and
markers of IPF lung injury. Our central hypothesis is that biologic and biochemical perturbations that occur in the
lung microenvironment of IPF patients will elucidate novel mechanisms of lung injury in IPF to advance precision
diagnostics and elucidate future targets to develop precise treatments. To begin to attain this overall objective,
we will pursue the following two Specific Aims. Our first aim is to identify differences in spatial gene expression
in areas of fibrosis and inflammation in lung tissue from IPF patients that correlate to survival. Our second aim
is to identify differential protein and metabolite levels in BALF from IPF patients that correlate to survival. We
propose to combine an established and well-characterized, large cohort of patients with a rare disease and
stored samples that are no longer collected in modern clinical or research eras (surgical lung biopsy tissue) with
cutting edge precision medicine tools like spatial transcriptomics and label-free quantitative proteomics and
metabolomics. Importantly, this cohort has paired lung fluid samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) which allows
us to identify markers of these novel IPF phenotypes in the lung in a clinically accessible compartment via
bronchoalveolar lavage. This innovative proposal will define groups of IPF patients with unique molecular and/or
biologic pathways that can set the stage for prospective biomarker guided, therapeutic interventional trials.
Additionally, these findings will help us understand for the first time how IPF patients with poor survival are
different from those with better survival using precision medicine approaches at the individual molecular, protein
and metabolite level."
10849365,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed work aims to decipher the genetic mechanisms dysregulated in the brains of individuals with
schizophrenia with pleiotropic effects influencing expression of sleep disturbances. The ultimate goals are to
inform genomic driven medical care for improved treatment of insomnia-related symptoms, which are among the
most common co-occurring conditions in these patients. Sleep disruptions in individuals with schizophrenia are
associated with more severe schizophrenia-related symptoms. Healthy sleep is also important for brain
development, indicating that effectively managing sleep disturbances may have significant impacts on reducing
severity of schizophrenia symptoms and improving long-term health outcomes. Characterizing pleiotropic
genetic effects via integration of omics data holds promise for informing precision medicine approaches to
treatment of sleep problems in these individuals. During the last few decades, investigators at the University of
Kansas Medical Center have amassed numerous whole brain specimens from human donors diagnosed with
schizophrenia and confirmed controls. This brain bank reflects a diverse collection of specimens from males and
females with different reported race. This project will generate multi-omics data from sleep-wake regulating brain
regions in these specimens and identify genetic variation impacting function of pleiotropic genes and proteins
evidenced to increase risk for both schizophrenia and insomnia-related symptoms. Genetic risk scores calculated
from sequence data that are useful to predicting risk and aiding in early detection and intervention will be
functionally validated. In addition, this project will comprehensively characterize gene and protein co-expression
connecting two important brain regions known to regulate human sleep behaviors. Combining evidence from the
genome, transcriptome and proteome will allow for discerning the biochemical pathways and genetic
mechanisms dysregulated in sleep-wake regulating brain regions from these patients and help identify proteins
that can be targeted by small molecule compounds to treat sleep problems more effectively. This work should
also provide knowledge of how convergent mechanisms influence risk for multiple disorders in the same
individual. The approaches developed and data generated in this project will provide a rich resource that will be
shared with the larger scientific community allowing for investigations of the sleep regulation network in a diverse
representation of individuals with mental health conditions."

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression,
obsessive compulsive disorder, and smoking cessation. Despite evidence that TMS improves symptoms by
modulating brain connectivity, the few published studies that have measured brain connectivity before and
after neuromodulatory TMS have been population-, dose-, and pattern-specific, with connectivity effects that
are limited in scope to a handful a priori regions of interest. Accordingly, there is a critical need for generalized,
comprehensive model that explains how functional brain connectivity changes at the whole-brain level
following neuromodulatory TMS. Therefore, the objectives of this grant are to 1) develop a model using whole-
brain estimates of the TMS-induced electric (e)-field to predict changes in resting state functional connectivity
following neuromodulatory TMS, and 2) validate this model in a large cohort of healthy volunteers receiving
multiple doses of either intermittent or continuous theta burst stimulation (iTBS and cTBS, respectively). Our
central hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity will vary systematically with the current density at
the cortex, operationally defined using e-field modelling. We have pilot data suggesting that the variability in
pre-post rsFC changes following TMS can be predicted using estimates of the current density at the cortex with
a medium to large effect size. Our approach will be to measure rsFC in healthy volunteers before and after
each of 3 doses (5 sessions/dose; 600 pulses/session) of iTBS or cTBS. Stimulation will be delivered to the left
dlPFC, and targeting will be individualized based on fMRI data collected during the Sternberg working memory
paradigm. Our primary outcome measure will be the percent of variability in pre-post rsFC accounted for by our
model. Our rationale for this approach is that by collecting resting state data pre and post these doses of iTBS
and cTBS, we will be able to quantify the effect of pattern (i.e. cTBS vs. iTBS) and dose (i.e. number of pulses)
on functional connectivity changes. This work is innovative because it uses a novel application of e-field
modelling to predict changes in rsFC data following TMS administration."

We request funds to purchase a new single-crystal X-ray diffractometer (scXRD) equipped with a Cu-anode
rotating source, VariMaxHF computer-controlled optics and a hybrid photon counting detector. This equipment
will be installed in the Department of Biochemistry at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) as a shared
resource. The department has a long history of supporting macromolecular crystallography dating back to
1992. The requested equipment will replace an outdated 18-year-old diffractometer that has been a workhorse
for the collection of macromolecular X-ray diffraction data by numerous NIH-funded investigators. Structural
biology has long been a cornerstone for a diverse group of NIH-funded researchers at MCW and in
southeastern Wisconsin. This is demonstrated by the continued support of the Biomolecular NMR Facility (Est.
2000), the formation of the Program in Chemical Biology (PCB) in 2017, and the acquisition of a Thermo
Glacios cryo-EM installing on MCW’s campus in 2023. The continued expansion of drug discovery on campus
has recently benefited from over a $5M investment in infrastructure and the commitment to hire 2 to 3 tenure-
track faculty into the PCB. Additionally, the Department of Biochemistry has hired two structural biologists
within the past four years. Consistent with a 30-year track record of supporting scXRD systems, MCW has
committed space to house the requested system, funds for service contracts/consumables, and salary support
for technical staff to ensure training of the users. We describe projects for six major users with NIH-funding and
ten minor users (seven with NIH-funding). These user projects aim to understand a wide range of human
diseases: cancer, psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s, ischemia, viral infectivity by cytomegalovirus and
coronavirus, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty-acid liver disease. Many of these projects involve developing
small molecules for future therapeutics. The proteins are as diverse (soluble, transmembrane, integral
membrane) as their functions and require an scXRD capable of handling this diversity. The requested system
from Rigaku has the versatility to handle these projects. These researchers will rely on its increased sensitivity
and the ability to collect data directly from crystallization trays. Our user group will also benefit from this
instrument's ability to determine the absolute configuration of small molecules, a capability lacking in the local
community. When installed, the requested diffractometer will be the only one in Wisconsin and one of less than
five installed at academic institutions in the United States. A staff with more than 18 years of experience in X-
ray crystallography and 10 years of experience operating and maintaining scXRD instrumentation will oversee
the new system. Users will be trained in the operation of this system, and instrument time will be allocated
using a web-based scheduling system. An advisory committee will provide oversight of operations and conflict
resolution. Acquisition of the scXRD system requested in this S10 application will significantly accelerate NIH-
funded biomedical research programs at MCW and other institutions in the region."
10853766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and multifactorial disease, with a prevalence of 42%. Obesity treatment is
challenging in clinical practice because of the physiologic and behavioral adaptations that occur during the
weight-reduced state to preserve energy. Our overall goal is to develop an evidence-based, phenotype-guided
approach for obesity treatment that enhances weight loss and induces weight loss maintenance despite weight-
reduced state adaptations. Our research has identified obesity phenotypes based on energy homeostasis and
behavioral traits. Obesity phenotypes include abnormal satiation (i.e., requiring more calories at each meal to
achieve fullness), abnormal postprandial satiety (i.e., accelerated gastric emptying and increased postprandial
hunger), emotional eating (i.e., eating in response to positive or negative emotions), and abnormal resting energy
expenditure (i.e., low resting energy expenditure). In pilot clinical studies, these obesity phenotypes have
predicted weight loss response to anti-obesity medications and bariatric endoscopic devices. We recently
published data from a 12-week proof-of-concept, non-randomized clinical trial of 165 patients in which 84
participants received lifestyle interventions designed for each phenotypic trait they had and 81 received standard
lifestyle recommendations. The phenotype-tailored lifestyle intervention (PLI) resulted in greater weight loss
compared to the standard lifestyle intervention (SLI) approach for obesity. Patients in the PLI showed
improvement of their phenotype-defining trait(s). Improvement in these traits may explain the greater weight loss
as they potentially counteract physiologic and behavioral adaptations of the weight-reduced state. To validate
these data, we must study PLI in a longer-term and randomized clinical trial. Furthermore, the current methods
used to identify phenotypes in our preliminary studies are time-consuming, invasive, expensive, limited to a few
academic centers, and not accessible for most patients. In an academic-industry partnership, we have developed
a novel biomarker test that predicts obesity phenotypes but that needs to be validated in a large prospective
cohort. As such, we have formulated the following central hypothesis: “tailoring lifestyle recommendations to
obesity phenotypes will enhance long-term weight loss outcomes in adult patients with obesity”. To test our
central hypothesis, we propose a 12-month randomized, blinded, parallel clinical trial in adults with
obesity to test three aims: 1) To compare the outcomes of PLI vs. SLI program; 2) After a 12-month weight loss
program, to compare the long-term effect of PLI compared to SLI on physiological (i.e., satiation, postprandial
satiety, energy expenditure) and behavioral (i.e., emotional eating) adaptations; and 3) To explore whether a
phenotype biomarker predicts weight loss in response to PLI compared to SLI. Significance: Our study has the
potential to introduce an individualized treatment that targets pathophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of
energy balance to enhance and maintain weight loss outcomes."
10853829,"Project Abstract
Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare and often lethal form of liver cancer that primarily affects
children and young adults without cirrhosis. There are no approved systemic therapies for FLC, and it is usually
refractory to treatment approaches developed for other forms of liver cancer. A chimeric transcript between
DNAJB1 and PRKACA was identified as a signature genomic event in FLC and leads to activation of PKAc.
However, pharmacological inhibition of PKAc for FLC with traditional small molecule inhibitors has been
infeasible due to on-target toxicity. Our preliminary data derived from preclinical models of FLC and human FLC
tumors show that the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion results in a metabolic rewiring of the tumor cell, leading to
glutamine dependence. Induction of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion in preclinical cell lines is associated with
sensitivity to glutamine antimetabolite therapy. Glutamine dependency in FLC results in a nutrient-depleted tumor
immune microenvironment (TiME) that is enriched in immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., ammonia, acidosis),
impairing antitumor immunity. In an in vivo model of FLC, the combination of glutamine antimetabolite therapy
plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) reverses T cell dysfunction within the tumor immune microenvironment
(TiME) and induces antitumor immunity resulting in robust tumor control. We are translating these preclinical
findings into a clinical trial of a glutamine antagonist (sirpiglenastat) in combination with a PDL1 inhibitor
(durvalumab). In Aim 1, we will conduct a clinical trial to test the safety and clinical activity of sirpiglenastat in
combination with durvalumab, in children or adults with advanced FLC. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
treatment with sirpiglenastat combined with durvalumab suppresses glutamine-dependent processes and
increase the number of activated FLC-specific T cells within the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 3, we will identify
the molecular mechanism and specific metabolic perturbations through which the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion
induces glutamine addiction and immune suppression. This work will advance a promising new treatment
approach for advanced FLC, a tumor type that currently confers a median survival of only one year. Uncovering
the activity of specific pathways that make FLC glutamine dependent will establish a more complete
understanding of metabolic biomarkers of glutamine addiction, and will reveal synergistic vulnerabilities, which
may be targetable for even more effective treatment approaches. We anticipate that these avenues of inquiry
will likely be generalizable to other classes of glutamine addicted tumors."

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a symptom-based diagnosis characterized
by severe debilitating fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and widespread pain. Most cases of ME/CFS begin with a
viral infection or involve multiple exposures to pathogens over time. Soon after the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic, a significant portion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed chronic symptoms that
overlap greatly with those of ME/CFS. Among the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), “brain fog”
symptoms have been widely reported including in patients with mild initiating infection. Many PASC patients
meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS after 6 months of ongoing symptoms (referred to herein as PASC-
ME/CFS). Given the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the disease burden on individuals with
ME/CFS and PASC-ME/CFS, and the challenges associated with these conditions such as rehabilitation and
workforce disruptions, elucidating the mechanisms of cognitive deficits in ME/CFS and PASC-ME/CFS is of

The focus of this future trial will be to examine the efficacy of a novel approach to preventing physical frailty, which we have developed in our pilot work: Café Move. Café Move uses simple yet robust assessments of strength, mobility and balance to enable people to quickly and easily gain insight to their physical function, relative to normative data (accounting for age, height, etc.). All of the Café Move assessments can be performed outside of formal healthcare settings (e.g., in a person’s home), thus promoting autonomy and reducing barriers to access.

The “dine-in” option will involve face-to-face assessments at scheduled community events. The “kiosk” option will be available via Café Move stations hosted locally within the community, analogous to a blood pressure check station at the local drug store; trained personnel are nearby, but people can interact with the platform on their own. Finally, the “delivery” option will allow people to order the (inexpensive) assessment supplies and perform measurements in their own home.

10855874,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Globally, mental disorders are the second largest contributor to the burden of disease in adults.
In settings disrupted by war and civil unrest, violence and loss contribute to significant
unaddressed burden of mental disorders and family violence in adults with subsequent risks to
children. In Rwanda the intergenerational mental health consequences of the 1994 Genocide
against the Tutsi in Rwanda persist; recent studies found that 20% of the Rwandan population
has one or more mental disorders with the highest rates observed in Genocide survivors. Sugira
Muryango is an evidence-based, trauma-informed, family-based behavioral intervention to
promote healthy family functioning, early childhood development and reduce family violence. In
several trials, Sugira Muryango has led to improvements in parental mental health and child
development outcomes including social and emotional development of children, improved
caregiver mental health and reductions in family violence. To support scaling the intervention the
University of Rwanda and other partners developed a Digital Dashboard tool that: (a)
streamlines collection of data on evidence-based intervention quality and reach; (b) improves
visibility and searchability of implementation data by region; (c) facilitates caregiver mental
health and social services referrals and follow up; and (d) serves as a training platform with
resources to enhance interventionist fidelity and competence. In the context of understanding
important factors for scaling evidence-based interventions, the proposed research will
investigate dashboard-supported delivery of Sugira Muryango in terms of its reach, efficiency,
and cost effectiveness. The Hybrid Type 3 implementation-effectiveness study will collect
outcomes measuring the program’s effectiveness, quality of program delivery, feasibility, and
acceptability from program beneficiaries, the interventionists, their supervisors, and community
stakeholders. The study will compare the trajectories of fidelity, competence, and self-efficacy
between dashboard-supported delivery and standard delivery. The study will also include social
network analysis to understand how the characteristics of networks comprised of supervisors
and interventionists affect trajectories over time. Lastly, the study will investigate the impact of
dashboard-supported delivery by comparing the difference in child and caregiver mental health
outcomes with standard delivery. These data will be used to analyze cost-effectiveness and
return on investment of the intervention as delivered with and without the Dashboard. The
results of the proposed research will identify scalable pathways to accelerate integration of
technology and evidence-based mental health services into policy and practice in Rwanda."

Vocal communication is essential for human social relationships, and deficits in vocal communication that
characterize autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have devastating impacts on the affected individuals and on
society. Despite the importance of vocalization to social behavior, the brain circuits that allow animals to
vocalize appropriately according to behavioral context remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks to apply
powerful intersectional tools in the mouse to (1) identify and characterize forebrain-to-midbrain circuits that
underlie the context-dependent control of social vocalizations and (2) to understand the midbrain circuits that
underlie the production of distinct acoustic categories of vocalization. Prior work has shown that midbrain-
projecting neurons of the preoptic hypothalamus regulate courtship vocalizations in male mice. Aside from
these neurons, the forebrain inputs to the midbrain that regulate social vocalizations, and whether the relevant
inputs differ according to social context, remains unknown. Aim 1 will combine in vivo calcium imaging,
neuronal silencing, and mapping of axonal projections to test the hypothesis that midbrain-projecting preoptic
neurons regulate social vocalizations produced during affiliative female-female interactions. In Aim 2,
retrograde tracing from the midbrain will be combined with Fos mapping and light sheet imaging of optically
cleared brains to identify novel populations of midbrain-projecting forebrain neurons that are active during and
may regulate vocal communication during courtship, during female-female interactions, or in both contexts. In
Aim 3, activity-dependent labeling in the midbrain will be combined with neuronal ablation and retrograde
tracing from hindbrain vocal premotor neurons to test the hypothesis that distinct sets of midbrain neurons
control the production of different acoustic categories of vocalization. This work will delineate brain circuits that
underlie the context-dependent control of vocalization in the mammalian brain, and more broadly, that link the
encoding of social information to the flexible and appropriate execution of social behaviors. By identifying core
mechanisms of healthy vocal communication, this work will provide a foundation to understand neural circuit
alterations the contribute to vocal communication differences in mouse models of ASD and other
neurodevelopmental disorders."
10856078,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Specific microbial and immune features of vaginal ecosystems, including a Lactobacillus-deplete microbiota,
have been linked to spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). Mechanisms driving associations remain incompletely
understood. Premature cervical remodeling, involving cervicovaginal (CV) epithelial barrier dysfunction, is a
key biologic process on the pathway to PTB. In other systems, metabolomics has emerged as a lens through
which phenotypes of microbial ecosystems can be more clearly elucidated. Microbial and host metabolite-
modification of immune responses and epithelial barrier integrity has given rise to novel targeted postbiotic
therapeutics. The bioactive potential of the vaginal metabolome remains under investigated. Our group
recently identified a role for vaginal polyamines in discerning individuals at greatest risk of PTB in those with
similar microbiota-related risk — among individuals with a Lactobacillus-deplete microbiota, those who
delivered preterm had a 25-fold reduction in spermine. Polyamines spermidine and spermine play key
roles in immunity and oxidative balance in other systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate their
effects on barrier function in the CV space. Our central hypothesis is that vaginal spermidine and spermine
maintain immune homeostasis and mitigate oxidative stress to enhance barrier function in the setting of a
Lactobacillus-deplete microbiota. We further posit that inadequate host production of spermidine and spermine
in response to microbial challenge results in CV barrier dysfunction, ascribing a mechanistic link between
vaginal metabolites and cervical remodeling. We propose the following aims: 1) determine how polyamines
modify immune responses in the CV space; 2) determine how polyamines regulate oxidative balance in
the CV space; and 3) quantify associations of vaginal polyamines with premature cervical remodeling.
In the first aim, we will use in vitro methodology to interrogate the role of polyamines in inflammasome
activation, NFB-induction of immune mediators, macrophage differentiation, and epithelial-immune cell
communication. For the second aim, we will use in vitro methodology to investigate polyamine effects on
oxidative stress measured by lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme expression, DNA and protein damage, as
well as the ability of polyamine-mediated oxidative balance to modify host immune responses. In the third aim,
we will leverage an ongoing pregnancy cohort to quantify associations between polyamines, lipid peroxidation
markers, and short cervix to assess the potential impact of polyamines on tissue remodeling and PTB. We
propose an innovative approach to define mechanisms by which the vaginal metabolome may modify cervical
remodeling. Implications of this work extend beyond pregnancy, as immune perturbations and oxidative stress
contribute to myriad adverse reproductive outcomes. Findings may be harnessed to modify aspects of the
vaginal ecosystem through novel postbiotic strategies, thereby improving reproductive health outcomes."
10861901,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become an increasingly popular treatment approach for breast cancer
(BC) patients. It enables locally advanced and inflammatory BC patients to be eligible for breast conservative
surgery. However, emerging evidence suggests that preoperative NAC may paradoxically increase the risk of
BC cancer chemoresistance and progression, thus limiting its therapeutic efficacy. The specific goals of this
application are to define a novel role for alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) in mediating NAC-induced
chemoresistance and metastasis of BC and to develop this concept into novel therapeutic approaches to
improving BC therapy. ACER2 is a member in the alkaline ceramidase family that we identified initially from the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then from mammals. ACER2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide to
generate sphingosine (SPH), which is immediately converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid
that has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, protumoral immune responses, and
cancer stem cell survival. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that doxorubicin (DOX), a chemotherapeutic
agent commonly used in BC patients, induces a marked increase in the levels of S1P in in the tumor, primary
site of the tumor (mammary fat pads), and major metastatic tissues of BC (brain, bone marrow, liver, and lungs)
in a syngeneic mouse model of BC. We further show that knocking out the mouse alkaline ceramidase 2 gene
(Acer2) from host cells markedly inhibits DOX-induced increase in the levels of S1P in the tumor and the
aforementioned tissues, robustly augments DOX-induced tumor growth inhibition, and inhibits DOX-induced
pulmonary metastasis of BC. These compelling results support our hypothesis that NAC-induced upregulation
of the ACER2/S1P pathway mediates BC chemoresistance and metastasis. As a further corollary, we
hypothesize that blocking the ACER2/S1P pathway with an ACER2 inhibitor (ACER2i) will improve the
therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents against BC by mitigating chemotherapy-induced
chemoresistance and metastasis of BC. To test these hypotheses, we will 1) establish that ACER2 mediates
NAC-induced chemoresistance and metastasis of BC (Aim 1); 2) Define the molecular and cellular mechanisms
by ACER2 mediates NAC-induced chemoresistance and metastasis (Aim 2); and 3) Establish that targeting
ACER2 with its small molecule inhibitor (ACER2i) would mitigate NAC-induced chemoresistance and metastasis
of BC and thereby improves NAC of BC (Aim 3). Successful completion of these aims will 1) validate the
pathological role of the ACER2/S1P pathway in cancer chemoresistance, metastasis, and recurrence; and 2)
provide a proof of concept that targeting the ACER2 pathway would improve BC chemotherapy. Given the poor
clinical outcome of patients with most cancers, these studies may have widespread impact on the clinical
management of these patients."

 We hypothesize that a room-temperature, 360°, isocentric proton therapy gantry fits inside a
Linac vault, a.k.a the Mini-Gantry. This would enable the conversion of two neighboring Linac
vaults (one for the Mini-Gantry and one for the accelerator) into an ultra-compact proton therapy
center and increase the accessibility of proton therapy, especially in urban centers with existing
linear accelerator vaults where space is a constraint. Existing proton therapy gantries are larger
than 24’ in diameter. The proton gantries at Massachusetts General Hospital occupy 3 stories.
The IBA ProteusOne gantry is 25’ in diameter. None of these fit in a typical 12’ high basement
of a high-rise building and require custom-designed spaces. The aim is to optimize the proton
maximum energy and treatment field size in the Mini-Gantry while maintaining 12’ diameter and
produce designs. This effort determines the feasibility of the Mini-Gantry concept which is a
stepping stone to publications, grants, patents, prototypes, and partnering with a proton therapy

10837020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All cells and organisms are subjected to mechanical forces. These forces are sensed by cell surface receptors,
such as the epithelial (E)-cadherin, which links cells to their neighbors. E-cadherin responds to force by
activating signaling pathways inside the cell. These pathways trigger the formation of new cell-cell adhesions
and stimulate the rearrangement and reinforcement of the actin cytoskeleton. These actin cytoskeletal
rearrangements are energetically costly. We recently discovered that the energy required to fuel the
cytoskeletal rearrangements is provided by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a master regulator
of metabolism. It is activated when force is applied to E-cadherin and signals for ATP. The ATP produced fuels
the cytoskeletal changes necessary for cells to resist external forces. Thus, AMPK is mechanosensitive and
links E-cadherin mechanotransduction to energy homeostasis. Using biochemical, biophysical, and cell
biological approaches, in this proposal we will develop a paradigm for how mechanotransduction and
metabolism are coordinated. We will identify how: (1) glucose is taken up into the cell in response to force, (2)
metabolism and reinforcement of the actin cytoskeletal are spatially coordinated, (3) different magnitudes of
force impact cell mechanics, and (4) forces relayed from E-cadherin adjust global cellular metabolism. Through
this work, we intend to provide a fundamentally new picture of the interconnected pathways that govern
mechanotransduction. This new paradigm can be applied to better understand other mechanosensitive
systems. Additionally, it will inform the nature of disease defects and define strategies to prevent metabolic
disturbances."

Clinical rehabilitations scientists with the formal research training to bring multidisciplinary research
approaches to answer important questions related to rehabilitation are scarce. The goal of this pre-doctoral
training program is to continue to improve the quality and quantity of individuals who will contribute to the
knowledge and evidence that drives best practice in physical rehabilitation. This successful and innovative
training program, coordinated through the Department of Physical Therapy, has had 20 years of previous
funding. All trainees who have completed the DPT portion of the program have successfully passed the
national licensure examination in Physical Therapy on their first attempt and have become licensed to practice
physical therapy. All past trainees have become postdoctoral fellows or entered into faculty or research-
intensive positions. Those in faculty positions are in some of the most outstanding Physical Therapy programs
in the US. Their work has received awards, been published in journals of high quality (highest impact journals
in rehabilitation), and been frequently cited. In addition, 6/11 of our trainees who are in faculty positions have
been PI or Co-I on NIH funding, with 4 as PIs on active R01 grants. Additionally, our most recent cadre of T32
program graduates have funding from private foundations (e.g., American Heart Association), PCORI, and one
is a Fulbright Scholar. These data are a representation of the outstanding scientific impact of our previous
trainees. It is also notable that all of the current trainees or those who are in post-doctoral positions have
received scholarships and/or external funding, again a testament to the outstanding productivity and quality of
work of our trainees. The program fuses two independent training programs: an outstanding entry level
Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) and a very successful interdisciplinary PhD program in Biomechanics and
Movement Science. The program is analogous to the MD/PhD programs that train medical scientists. By
helping to reduce the often sizable debt incurred during the DPT training program, trainees are able to delay
the opportunity to earn the salaries that clinicians enjoy and move directly into the PhD program. Students in
the program become both physical therapists and rehabilitation research scientists. Trainees are selected from
a pool of outstanding students with diverse undergraduate backgrounds who enter the DPT program. Many of
these students express an interest in research before admission to the program. This training program attracts
the best and brightest individuals with a sincere interest in physical rehabilitation research and tracks them
early in their training into research careers. The need is enormous. Both new and established academic
physical therapy programs need doctorally trained individuals for teaching and research positions. Graduates
of this training program are ideal faculty members who foster excellence in rehabilitation research."

Overall, the Asia-Pacific region has achieved impressive reductions in malaria over the last 20 years. However,
our current Asia-Pacific ICEMR (2017-2024) has documented strongly diverging regional malaria trends:
Cambodia is nearing P. falciparum (Pf) elimination but is confronted with the challenge of stubbornly resilient
residual P. vivax (Pv) transmission while Papua New Guinea (PNG) recorded 1.2 million new cases in 2021.
Despite their differing progress, both countries face common challenges: optimal allocation of sparse resources
in heterogeneous transmission settings driven by asymptomatic infections, environmental change affecting
malaria transmission, emerging drug and insecticide resistance and the specific the challenge of eliminating Pv.
The renewed Asia-Pacific ICEMR will address these challenges by conducting research that applies new
techniques and approaches to achieve translational outcomes. We will i) develop and validate optimised
surveillance and response systems that combine traditional epidemiological and vector surveillance with targeted
reactive population surveys; ii) understand key drivers of ongoing Pv transmission in a wide range of transmission
intensity settings and identify locally optimal combinations of interventions to restrict and eventually interrupt
transmission; iii) generate evidence on the ability of novel tools and interventions to improve access to Pv radical
cure and target the asymptomatic Pv reservoir; and iv) Determine the threat of emerging drug and insecticide
resistance. The renewed ICEMR proposes a coordinated set of field, laboratory and modelling studies across 5
sites including a very low transmission site in Cambodia and 4 low, medium and high transmission PNG sites.
In the Epidemiology Project, health facility surveillance, cross-sectional, and reactive case detection studies
augmented by novel molecular, genomic and serological diagnostic assays will be used to accurately measure
malaria transmission and identify key drivers of residual transmission. Through in-depth molecular surveillance
and efficacy monitoring we will map the spread Pf artemisinin resistance (ArtR) in PNG and confirm the
emergence of Pv ArtR and mefloquine resistance in Cambodia, while conducting coordinated studies to address
barriers to increased access and efficacy of Pv radical cure. The Transmission Project will conduct in-depth
vector surveillance coupled with vector genetic studies to better understand the epidemiological observations in
Project 1, map the recent emergence of pyrethroid resistance in PNG, document vector range expansions due
to the accelerating impacts of climate and land-use change, assess the decreasing effectiveness of vector control
tools, investigate factors facilitating asymptomatic Pv transmission and evaluate novel transmission blocking
interventions. These studies will use innovative diagnostic tests and inform state-of-the-art malaria transmission
models provided by two Technical Cores. Throughout the research program policy-relevant scenario modelling
will be used determine locally optimal combinations of interventions. Together, these studies will provide malaria
programs with accurate and timely data for action and new solutions to accelerate malaria elimination."

The proposed ICEMR aims to address the complex challenges of malaria elimination in the Asia-Pacific region
by providing evidence-based tools and knowledge for policymakers. The ICEMR will achieve this by conducting
a coordinated set of field, laboratory, and mathematical modelling studies. The ICEMR Data and Modelling Core
will support these studies in 3 major ways: 1) implementing an efficient data capture and management system
using REDCap and establish procedures for efficient data sharing, 2) establishing a statistical support network
for ICEMR investigators, and 3) developing advanced mathematical models for malaria transmission in highly
endemic countries. A web-based REDCap data management platform will be designed that includes direct
electronic data capture using tablets and a REDCap data server physically hosted at WEHI. The software is
flexible and suitable for locations with minimal access to computers. This will allow for safe and efficient data
capturing at point-of-care across sites and projects. All databases will be set up using standard formats that allow
easy data sharing within and outside the project. The Core will develop procedures for efficient upload of
epidemiological, vector and laboratory data to public repositories such as ClinEpiDB, VectorBase, PlasmoDB,
and GitHub. To facilitate the use of research data for program management and policy making, project data will
be incorporated, in near real-time, into an existing Tupaia.org sentinel site surveillance dashboard that is
accessible to ICEMR researchers, local government and healthcare workers. The highly experienced team at
WEHI and the University of Melbourne will provide statistical analysis support for ICEMR investigators and deliver
in-country workshops. Mathematical malaria transmission modelling is essential to achieving this ICEMR’s
objectives and will be used to develop optimized surveillance responses and assist with translating research
findings into policy and programmatic implementation. To do this, the Core will extend and adapt its existing
individual-based models of P. vivax and P. falciparum transmission in 3 important ways: 1) models will be
adapted for very low and elimination settings to be able to predict the probability that an intervention will lead to
local elimination; 2) single species models will be combined into a co-transmission model to investigate how co-
infection of multiple Plasmodium species affects transmission; and 3) models will be made spatially explicit to
better account for spatial heterogeneity in transmission and model spatially targeted surveillance and intervention
approaches. The core modelers will collaborate closely with colleagues at Institut Pasteur Paris and where
required can draw on the expertise of two large Australian infectious disease modelling networks. The Data Core
team will be key to facilitating the translation of ICEMR research into evidence-based policies and interventions
that could ultimately reduce the burden of malaria and improve public health outcomes in affected populations."

Research Training in Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Cognition in Aging, MCI, and Alzheimer’s Disease
Revised Project Summary/Abstract
This competitive renewal application requests continuation of a 15-year predoctoral training program at the University of Florida (UF). Funds are requested for six (6) predoctoral trainees. The program focuses on research training in non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive aging (CA), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with three substantive emphases: (a) behavioral interventions (e.g., cognitive training, exercise, mindfulness); (b) multi-component compensatory interventions; and (c) neuromodulation/stimulation interventions for older adults with and without MCI- and AD-related cognitive impairment. We have three levels of preceptors: Mentors are tenured senior scientists with predoctoral training track records. Senior advisors are field leaders (often center directors, and physician-scientists) who often do not directly supervise predocs, but provide infrastructure (grants, center resources, data sets) and will serve on mentoring committees. Mentors-in-training (M-i-T) are untenured junior PhDs with research programs; they will receive mentoring training (e.g., UF Mentoring Academy) and will be coupled with a senior mentor as co-mentors for trainees, and are expected to enhance the diversity of the pipeline of future mentors. Disciplines represented in this proposal include applied physiology and kinesiology, biomedical engineering, communication sciences, geriatrics, neuroscience/neurology, nursing, occupational therapy, psychology, public health, and social epidemiology. Core program components include (1) assignment of each student to a frequently convened multi-disciplinary mentoring team (2) formation and close tracking of individual developmental goals in the areas of research, education, and service; (3) regular training director meetings to consider protection of human research participants, theory/method/past findings in cognitive interventions, rigor and reproducibility, and professional development; (4) required supplemental coursework and other didactics in interventions to be used with CA, MCI and AD, statistics/methodology, responsible conduct of research, and rigor and reproducibility. Preference is given to students who have completed doctoral qualifying examinations, thereby selectively investing resources in committed, productive students who have already completed major program milestones. Proposed changes to the program include: (a) leveraging enhanced capacity at UF to focus more strongly on interventions to be used with CA, MCI and AD; (b) increasing mechanisms for trainees to engage in collaborative team science; and (c) introducing a mentor-in-training role to create a diverse pipeline of future mentors. Progress to date: Of 37 trainees to date, 27 (73%) were women, 11 (30%) were members of under-represented racial/ethnic minorities. Twelve (12) trainees remain in training (student, intern, post-doctoral fellow). Twenty-five (25) trainees are post-training with 22 (88%) in research intensive or research related positions, including :16 (64%) associate/assistant professors, 3 (12%) research scientists and 2 (8%) administrators; 17 (68%) in Research 1, 2 (8%) in Research 2, and 3 (12%) in VA institutions."
10835961,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) occurs in both children/young adults and in dogs, with an annual incidence of 450
and 25,000 cases, respectively, making dogs a useful comparative oncology model for the development
of OSA treatments. Unfortunately, outcomes for patients with OSA have plateaued over the past three
decades. Thus, new treatment approaches beyond the standard of care (SOC) surgery and
chemotherapy are sorely needed. As a novel therapy for OSA, our group is developing Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided cryotherapy in conjunction with image-guided intratumoral injection
of an immune adjuvant. To this end, we will perform a canine clinical trial comparing MRI-guided
cryotherapy alone or in conjunction with intratumoral immune adjuvant administration in spontaneously
occurring, non-metastatic, canine appendicular OSA. The proposed immune correlative studies will
provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of immune regulation in OSA tumors and the immunologic
impact of the therapies to guide future improvements. While cryotherapy directly kills OSA tumor cells,
our intent is to activate the patient’s adaptive immune system against tumor antigens that are presented
from the dying tumor cells, with the addition of intratumoral delivery of an immune adjuvant. Following
local control surgery, we hypothesize that the primed adaptive immune response can delay or prevent
the occurrence of metastatic disease, which is uniformly fatal. Using MRI, one can precisely determine
the extent of tumor tissue that is frozen and killed by cryotherapy without exposure to ionizing radiation.
Others have demonstrated an influx of macrophage and myeloid cells following cryoablation. Via
intratumoral injection, we will deliver a novel Stimulator of Interferon Gene (STING) agonist following
cryotherapy to activate the infiltrating innate immune cells. STING pathway activation results in
extensive cytokine induction, the activation of antigen presenting cells, and subsequent priming of T
cells. Our specific aims are: 1. To determine whether MRI-guided cryoablation of OSA generates an
immune response based on cytokine assays, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunoassays that can
prevent metastatic progression, as assessed by non-invasive imaging and thereby increase overall
survival compared to SOC treatment. 2. To characterize the immune response and safety of CT-guided
STING agonist intratumoral administration in canine OSA. 3. To determine whether MRI-guided
cryoablation combined with CT-guided intratumoral STING agonist administration prevents metastatic
disease progression and prolongs survival compared with SOC treatment for OSA. The high incidence
of OSA in dogs with a high rate of metastatic disease provides an ideal animal model with which to study
this novel image-guided treatment of OSA using clinically relevant imaging systems with the potential
for rapid translation and application in other solid tumors."

Latinx Americans are disproportionately affected by alcohol-related health complications compared to non-Latinx
Whites [3]. There is compelling evidence that Latinas may be particularly at risk for experiencing some alcohol-related
health problems compared to Latinos. Women are more likely to develop alcohol-related cirrhosis and are more likely to
have brain damage from alcohol use than men [4]. Disparities for women are further complicated by the intersection of
gender with ethnicity, as research shows that Latinas and other racial and ethnic minority women may be less likely to
seek treatment than non-Latina Whites [7]. Research also shows that the gender gap in drinking among Latinxs is
narrowing [5], and young Latina women are engaging in more hazardous alcohol behaviors [3]. The U.S. Latina
population is over 30 million [19]; thus, research examining alcohol use and misuse among Latinas must be a public
health priority. I am an Assistant Professor at a supportive research oriented Hispanic Serving Institution and committed
to a lifelong career of conducting research designed to reduce alcohol-related health disparities among Latinxs. The
training and research activities in this K01 application will address two major gaps in the literature on alcohol use among
Latinas in the U.S. Specifically, more research is needed to understand the most current patterns of alcohol use and misuse
among Latinas at the population level. Examinations of current national data devoted exclusively to U.S. Latinas is scarce,
particularly relative to the size of the Latina population. Also, the small body of literature examining gender role norms in
relation to alcohol use among Latinas is extremely limited, although this same literature highlights the importance of
understanding this link. Current research cannot address how shifts in salient gender role expectations transmitted in a
bicultural context relate to drinking (or abstaining) among Latinas. To effectively inform culturally tailored alcohol
prevention and treatment programs that serve the U.S. Latina population, it is crucial for researchers to address these
major gaps in the literature. To this end, I propose implementing complementary methods. First, I will use complex
survey analysis across three national datasets to draw directly from the most current national data available to assess
alcohol use and misuse among Latinas. Next, I will conduct qualitative research so that I may tease out the complexities
of drinking-related gender role expectations – from both traditional Latin culture and mainstream U.S. culture – that are
experienced by Latinas in the U.S. Themes that are gleaned from these discussions will be used to generate items for a
quantitative measure that captures how bicultural gender role expectations contribute to drinking behaviors among
Latinas. This final phase of my training will inform an R01 submission, which will pilot and validate the measure that I
will begin developing as a K01 awardee. Highlighting the “full circle” nature of this training, my R01 application will
include validating the measure among a national sample of U.S. Latinas. With a team of world-class mentors, this project
will address two major research gaps in the literature on alcohol use among Latinas and will also afford me expertise to
continue tackling major gaps in the literature using a holistic and complementary skillset of scientific methods."

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often causes end stage liver disease. Although current anti-HCV
drugs are successful in eliminating viral RNA load, they do not prevent reinfection. In addition, eliminating
HCV RNA load does not reduce the risk for progression to end stage liver disease. Therefore, the urgent
need for the development of a comprehensive strategy to control HCV infection must include a vaccine. HCV
envelope glycoproteins are the key components for the initiation of viral infection. Our phase I safety and
immunogenicity trial of a recombinant HCV envelope glycoprotein candidate vaccine did not induce a strong
immune response in most vaccinated volunteers. Subsequent studies indicated that purified HCV E2 has an
immunoregulatory role and biases primary macrophage activation toward the M2 phenotype (via E2-CD81
interactions), impairs DC/CD4+T cell functions, and leads to an environment for a muted response to
antigen. Nevertheless, HCV E2 still contains strong cross-genotype specific B- and T-cell epitopes vital to
an active immunity. We hypothesize that modifying E2 by discrete point mutations to inhibit interaction with
CD81 will improve immune functions and induce robust protective responses in combination with other HCV
regions as candidate vaccine, and will generate stronger protective efficacy. Outstanding abilities of
nucleoside modified mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to elicit potent immune responses against pathogens
makes it a viable new cost-effective platform for vaccine development. The incorporation of modified
nucleosides in the mRNA will offer advantages for generation of modified antigens to induce a broad effective
immune response. The premise and rigor of the study stems from our own work, and information in the
literature. Thus, the use of nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA of modified E2 for stronger immunogenicity
together with other viral antigens (E1 and non-structural (NS) genomic regions) for prime and boost with
proteins/peptides as a candidate vaccine for HCV cross protective efficacy will generate robust B- and T- cell
responses for protection against HCV. The results from our study will advance vaccine development against
persistent HCV infection."
10907829,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 There is a fundamental gap in understanding how platelet clearance is regulated. Until we gain a more
detailed understanding of this, we will lack effective therapies for some patients with low platelet counts
(thrombocytopenia) who are at risk for life-threatening bleeding. One important trigger for platelet clearance from
the body is desialylation, which refers to the removal of the sugar molecule sialic acid from glycoproteins on the
surface of the platelet. Platelet desialylation plays a role in accelerated clearance of platelets in immune
thrombocytopenia (ITP) and following transfusion of platelets that have been stored at cold temperatures.
Despite the clinical importance of desialylation, both the identity of the enzyme that cleaves platelet sialic
acid and its scope of glycoprotein substrates and products remain unknown, hampering efforts to develop
targeted therapies for ITP and other thrombocytopenic disorders. The central hypothesis is that human
neuraminidase 1 desialylates glycoprotein (GP) Ibα O-glycans as well as other platelet surface glycoproteins,
thereby accelerating platelet clearance in ITP and after cold storage.
 This hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims: 1) Determine which GpIbα glycans undergo
desialylation. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) will be used to analyze GpIbα purified from
platelets after desialylation is triggered in vitro either by incubation at 4°C or by incubation with sera from ITP
patients containing anti-GpIbα autoantibodies. 2) Determine which human neuraminidase desialylates glycans
that are relevant for platelet clearance. The effect of a panel of potent and selective small molecule
neuraminidase isoenzyme inhibitors will be tested in in vitro platelet desialylation experiments. The in vivo half
life of platelets treated with these desialylation inhibitors will be measured. 3) Identify platelet neuraminidase
substrates. An established strategy for enrichment of membrane glycoproteins will be employed to allow LC/MS
proteomics analysis of desialylated vs control platelets. The outcome will be a delineation of the key platelet
neuraminidase enzyme which catalyzes desialylation and its glycoprotein substrates and products. This will
provide the first biochemical characterization of the process of platelet desialylation and will pave the way for
development of more effective therapies for thrombocytopenia.
 The career development plan includes 1) training in chemical glycobiology as a member of the laboratory
of Prof. Carolyn Bertozzi at Stanford University and 2) training in platelet biology, mouse platelet transfusion
experiments, and immune thrombocytopenia under the mentorship of international experts at Stanford and
elsewhere, including Drs. Karin Hoffmeister, David Kuter, and Lawrence Leung. This will position Dr. Hollenhorst
to establish a unique niche as an independent physician-scientist investigator at the interface of chemical biology,
transfusion medicine, and non-malignant hematology."
10833860,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis is a devastating condition resulting from the immune system’s reaction to infection. 1.7 million
Americans are hospitalized annually with sepsis, resulting in over 270,000 deaths. Sepsis is more common
among older patients, leading to spending among Medicare beneficiaries totaling $41B in 2018. Treatment
costs and episode spending also vary widely across hospitals, driven largely by differences in post-acute care.
In an attempt to improve care, sepsis was included as one of the 31 inpatient episodes targeted under
Medicare’s Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced (BPCI-A) program. BPCI-A is a voluntary
program that creates incentives for hospitals to improve patient outcomes and reduce spending across a 90-
day post-discharge episode. BPCI-A has the potential to encourage hospitals to more effectively manage
patients during the admission to avoid subsequent complications and to discharge patients to lower acuity
post-acute settings. At the same time, BPCI-A is not designed primarily to improve quality, and changes in
patient outcomes – positive or negative – will be closely tied to hospital efforts to reduce spending. Patients
with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are both more likely to develop sepsis and to have
worse outcomes. Patients with ADRD have very high episode spending and are particularly vulnerable to
adverse outcomes following discharge, making their treatment for sepsis under BPCI-A critically important to
understand. Outside of ADRD, how patient risk and sepsis care pathways influence patient outcomes for
sepsis in the context of BPCI-A are not well understood. In this context, we propose the following aims: Aim 1.
Evaluate the effects of BPCI-A on outcomes for patients with sepsis. We will link hospital participation in BPCI-
A with national Medicare data to test the effects of the program on mortality, readmission, post-acute care,
days alive and at home, burdensome transitions, and discharge to hospice. Aim 2. Evaluate the effects of
BPCI-A on outcomes for sepsis patients with ADRD. Using validated Medicare claims algorithms to identify
patients with ADRD, we will test the impact of BPCI-A on outcomes for patients with ADRD. Aim 3. Understand
the relationship between clinical risk, treatment, and post-acute care treatment patterns and outcomes under
BPCI-A. Using unique data from the Michigan Sepsis Initiative linked to multi-payer claims data, we will identify
the clinical treatment patterns, patient risk factors, and hospital characteristics that predict patient outcomes.
We will examine whether hospitals participating in BPCI-A deploy a different set of strategies to manage
patients with sepsis. Our proposal is significant because it combines national data with detailed clinical insights
to understand the interplay between national policy and nuanced clinical care for patients with sepsis. Our
proposal is innovative in its combination of administration and registry data sources coupled with sophisticated
quantitative methods to answer a novel question."

10852113,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project aims to develop a compact fixed beamline solution incorporating Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient
(FFA) technology and a novel ultra-fast energy degrader for ultra-rapid dose delivery in proton therapy. By
leveraging the unique capabilities of this system, we seek to enhance the quality of proton therapy for patients
and significantly reduce the treatment time and cost of proton therapy. In particular, by delivering each field in a
few seconds, this system will enable effective and more efficient treatment of moving targets. At the same time,
the higher patient throughput and significantly reduced costs of facilities hosting this compact system will improve
the accessibility of proton therapy in the United States and worldwide. Moreover, up to 50% shorter treatment
times will significantly improve patient comfort. The project is composed of three specific aims: (1) Ultra-fast
beam delivery, (2) Beam transport fits within a single treatment room, and (3) Technology validation. Specific
Aim 1 focuses on achieving ultra-fast dose delivery by designing and validating an ultra-fast energy degrader
system capable of rapid beam energy changes. A full-size prototype of the degrader will be engineered by the
industrial partner Pyramid Technical Consultants. This will be followed by the design of the FFA-based beam
transport, enabling efficient energy switching and rapid dose delivery. The FFA lattice will be modeled and
simulated in detail. Pyramid Technical Consultants will also develop a fast pencil beam scanning (PBS) system,
which will be integrated into the beamline design. We will iteratively optimize the entire beam transport solution,
considering clinical requirements for beam quality. Specific Aim 2 will ensure that the beam transport system fits
within a single treatment room. This will involve designing the optics for a beam extraction segment, enabling
compatibility within a compact treatment room the size of a LINAC vault. Two options for the treatment room will
be investigated, including a compact ceiling-mounted synchrotron or a superconducting cyclotron to be paired
with our system. Specific Aim 3 focuses on the validation of the developed technology. Experimental testing will
be conducted to validate the degrader prototype and the fast PBS system, assessing their speed and accuracy
of dose delivery. Furthermore, a down-scaled FFA magnetic beamline will be installed to demonstrate system
feasibility and benchmark output beam parameters against detailed particle transport and tracking simulations.
Successful completion of these aims will pave the way for the translation of the FFA technology combined with
an ultra-fast energy degrader into a pre-commercial prototype of the compact beamline, offering a promising
solution to expedite treatments, improve patient outcomes, and address the limited availability and high cost of
proton therapy."
10851368,"Justification (include hypothesis): The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018
mandated implementation of federal evidence-building activities. Since enactment, there has been a growing
demand for training in best practices and guide materials to conduct evaluations of VA programs consistent
with VA Evidence Act requirements. The Center for Evaluation and Implementation Resources (CEIR) will
focus on the use of program evaluation best practices in everyday VA care settings, positioning CEIR to serve
as the QUERI Evaluation Coordinating Center in support of VA field-based needs related to the Evidence Act.
Gaps Addressed (Knowledge and Practices): CEIR will develop VA training opportunities in program
evaluation skills and best practices to facilitate the development of internal operational program evaluation
capacity, promote and coordinate rapid evaluation mechanisms, provide consultation on project methods and
key resources, and collaborate with PEPReC to meet the needs of VHA leaders and workgroups.
Innovativeness: CEIR promotes innovation by consolidating services to expand VA capacities related to
program evaluation and implementation science. By coordinating services related to these areas within one
center, program evaluation and practice dissemination can be standardized, assessed, and coordinated and
opportunities for improvement more easily identified. Through these efforts, VA will develop more rapid,
flexible evaluation capacity and broader staff competency in rapid program evaluations and rapid
implementation of new programs into standard clinical care. Specific Aims: Aim 1) Expand VA’s capacity to
conduct rapid program evaluations designed to address areas of operational priority by coordinating the
application, review, selection, and reporting processes for rapid evaluation mechanisms (i.e., QUERI Rapid
Response Teams, HSRD Researchers and Evaluators in Residence); Aim 2) Develop trainings which allow for
the development VA competence in program evaluation and implementation science best practices; Aim 3)
Provide consultation on national strategic decisions intended to support activities consistent with Evidence Act
goals; Aim 4) Effectively coordinate with QUERI leadership and PEPReC to support the time-sensitive
evaluation needs of VA and VHA leaders and workgroups. Project Methods: CEIR's activities will be informed
by best-practice resources such as the QUERI Implementation Roadmap, the QUERI Program Evaluation
Guide, and legislation such as the Evidence Act. For Aim 1, an Operations Core lead will oversee the
management of ORD rapid evaluation mechanisms (i.e., submissions, review and selection, allocation of
awards, and reporting) and the creation of REDCap databases for submission tracking. A Learning Core lead
will manage the development of evaluation and implementation science trainings and resources for Aim 2 such
as TMS trainings, slide decks, evaluation and implementation guides, and community of practice calls to
support skill development. Aim 3 will be accomplished by a team lead by a Partnership Core lead with
experience in VHA operations, evaluation, and clinical research and will include targeted assessment and
outreach efforts to ensure that consultation services are available to all interested VA personnel. Aim 4 will be
supported by work efforts that span the CEIR cores and are facilitated by regular workgroup meetings with
QUERI and PEPReC leadership. Description of Primary Outcomes/Endpoints: CEIR's impacts will be
demonstrated through the growth and expansion of the number of projects supported via ORD rapid evaluation
mechanisms; through the growth of program evaluation learning communities and expanded learning
opportunities for skill development (e.g., Program Evaluation Boot Camp, ""Implementation 101"" slide set,
Qualitative Methods Learning Collaborative); through the development and adoption of standardized
approaches to structure, carry out, and apply the results of evaluations within VA; and through the
development and consolidation of best-practice resources related to program evaluation and implementation."
10851367,"Communication between the myocardium and endocardium, separated by a layer of cardiac jelly, is essential for
heart morphogenesis, especially trabecular formation. Trabeculae are sheet-like structures that increase surface
area when the coronary system is not yet established. Lack of trabeculation causes embryonic demise, and
excess trabeculation causes left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). The mortality of patients
with LVNC ranges from 5% to 47%. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms of trabeculation are not fully
understood, and how the communication between cardiomyocytes (CMs) in the myocardium and endocardial
cells (ECs) in the endocardium is achieved and regulates trabeculation is not fully known.
Some ligands and receptors engaged in myocardium-endocardium communication are localized to membranes
of CMs and ECs, yet how ligand/receptor-mediated interactions occur across the cardiac jelly has yet to be
deciphered. Unlike direct cell-cell interactions, distant cell-cell communication can be achieved via several
mechanisms, including diffusible factors such as morphogens and recently discovered novel microstructures
such as tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in cultured mammalian cells or cytonemes in flies. Whether a microstructure
that regulates signaling interaction among distant cells in vivo in mammals was not reported, and whether a
similar structure regulates the signaling interaction between the CMs and ECs during cardiovascular
morphogenesis is unknown. Via genetic labeling, electron microscopy (EM), and cryogenic-EM (Cryo-EM), our
preliminary data show a nanotube-like microstructure, which is named signaling bridges (SBs), extend from CMs
across cardiac jelly to reach ECs temporally; SB is sufficient to activate Notch signaling; disruption of SB by
deleting Cdc42 or by chemicals hinders Notch activation and alters CM cellular behaviors, resulting in
trabeculation defects. These novel preliminary data establish the essential roles of SBs in signal transduction
and trabeculation during cardiac morphogenesis; however, details regarding SB structure, function, and
regulatory mechanisms impacting heart morphogenesis remain unknown. We hypothesize that SBs are required
for the signaling interaction between the CMs and ECs to control cellular behaviors during trabeculation (Fig. 1).
Three aims are proposed: we will apply various electron microscopy to determine the ultrastructure and function
of SBs in Aim I; interrogate how SBs transduce signaling between ECs and CMs in Aim II; elucidate how SB
mediated interaction regulate trabecular morphogenesis in Aim III.
Completing the proposed studies will determine how signal interaction between the CMs and ECs is achieved
and how SBs regulate cellular behavior and trabecular formation. The discovery of SBs and their functions in
vivo opens new avenues for understanding intercellular interaction during cardiac morphogenesis. Successful
completion of this study will expand our understanding of the etiology of trabeculation defects and, ultimately,
the etiology of LVNC, thereby providing a base for developing new therapeutic strategies for mitigating LVNC."
10927456,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in reduced voluntary motor output, neuropathic pain, and autonomic
dysfunction. Unfortunately, pre-clinical research and clinically available therapies alike have failed to adequately
address the complex interrelationships amongst these changes in neural activity, despite widespread recognition
that inappropriate neural transmission in overlapping spinal networks underpins them all. This mechanistic
overlap suggests both that therapies intended to enhance recovery in one domain will likely impact multiple
domains simultaneously and that it may be possible to leverage the dense interconnectivity of spinal networks
to purposefully engineer multi-modal rehabilitation therapies – i.e., those specifically intended to address more
than one consequence of SCI. The ultimate goal of this work is to enhance quality of life for people living with
SCI by developing multi-modal therapies grounded in an integrative, neuro-mechanistic understanding of spinal
cord function. Aim 1 (F99 Phase) will focus on neurotechnology-driven multi-modal therapies to simultaneously
increase voluntary motor output while ameliorating neuropathic pain in a clinically relevant rat model of SCI. To
do so, I will study potential contributions of neurons in the motor-dominant regions of the spinal gray matter to
the spinal nociceptive process overall, which is traditionally only studied and characterized in the sensory-
dominant regions of the spinal gray matter. We will test whether a latent pain-processing network is present in
motor-dominant regions of the spinal gray matter, which becomes unmasked during periods of nociceptive
transmission in rats with SCI. We predict that the emergence of this previously undetected network will be
increasingly evident in rats with SCI-related neuropathic pain. If identified, this network could provide a new
target for neuroprosthetic therapies to deliver multimodal rehabilitation benefits. This would address two critical
unmet needs of the SCI population: non-opioid treatments for SCI-related neuropathic pain and multimodal
rehabilitation. Aim 2 (K00 Phase) will focus on enhancing multi-modal rehabilitation intended to simultaneously
improve bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction after SCI (i.e., pelvic floor dysfunction). Restoration of functions
compromised by inappropriate neural control of pelvic floor muscles is a top rehabilitation priority for people living
with SCI. Yet, despite its impact on physical and psychological health, the neural control of pelvic floor muscles
is a comparatively understudied area of spinal physiology and neurorehabilitation. Thus, in the K00 Phase I will
study the spinal neural control of pelvic floor muscles through the lends of somatic and autonomic integration,
which is both essential for maintaining appropriate pelvic floor function and is disrupted by nearly every SCI. I
will then be prepared to establish an independent research line developing multi-modal therapies that address
the intersectional challenges faced by people living with SCI-related bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction."
10830239,"The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) has three genetic variants (i.e., ε2, ε3, and ε4), and the ε4 variant of the
APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This means that APOE plays a major
role in the development of AD. The expression levels of APOE gene products (mRNA and protein) are potential
candidates that may partially explain APOE's effects in AD. But studies on APOE expression in AD have always
yielded conflicting data, and there is no consensus on whether ε4 carriers produce higher or a lower APOE
mRNA/protein. Such conflicting results have significantly obscured interpretation of APOE's expression role in
AD. Clearly, gaps exist between APOE's expression, the ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles, and AD status. There is a need for
better understanding their relationship. In our preliminary study, we have found that only a fraction of APOE
mRNA extends the full length of the gene; that is, the majority of mRNAs are prematurely terminated and cannot
produce functional apoE proteins. We have also detected the presence of novel circular RNAs in APOE RNA
pools. These data suggest that APOE's RNA transcription is complex and may pose more biological
consequences than previously thought; and that past APOE mRNA expression studies may have been flawed
for not measuring the true functional full-length mRNA. Deciphering the interplay between various APOE RNA
transcripts, the production of full-length mRNA, and the ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles will lead us to better understand the
effects of APOE expression in AD. In this study, we hypothesize that only a fraction of APOE mRNA extend the
full length of the gene to produce apoE protein; the ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles differentially modulate the production of these
functional full-length mRNAs, thereby adding diverse effects to AD risk. Our long-term goal is to fully understand
gene regulation of APOE and to use this knowledge to develop strategies for AD prevention and/or intervention.
Our short-term goal is to clarify the relationship between APOE RNAs transcription, the ε2/ε3/ε4 variants, and
AD risk and to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate APOE RNAs production. We have designed
three specific aims for the study. Aim 1 will investigate APOE RNAs and correlate their expression levels with
the ε2/ε3/ε4 allele variants, and AD status in human postmortem brain. Aim 2 will characterize the epigenetic
mechanisms that modulate the APOE RNAs transcription in human cell lines. Aim 3 will investigate the function,
biogenesis, and distribution of the newly discovered APOE circular RNA in human cell lines and body fluid. Our
work will not diminish the role of apoE protein; instead, it will dissect the contributions of APOE RNA from apoE
protein to complement APOE gene's comprehensive effects in AD."
10830243,"Although chemotherapy has significantly improved the survival of breast cancer patients, treatment failure still
remains a major clinical issue worldwide. Current knowledge about treatment failure is mostly derived from
research on intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance in epithelial tumor cells. However, recent studies have
implicated a critical role for host cells (i.e., the tissue microenvironment) in building a protective “niche” for
tumor cells enabling their escape from chemotherapeutic treatments. Notably, the host regenerative response
upon chemotherapy “injury”, which is regarded as a host intrinsic mechanism to repair damaged tissues, may
be exploited by tumor cells for their local recurrence or distant metastases. The proposed study will build on
our extensive experience in the study of tumor-stroma interactions in breast cancer metastasis, and will
investigate the poorly explored question of how chemotherapy-induced changes in the lung stroma foster the
early relapse of tumor cells in the lung. Based on our previous findings that tissue resident mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) acquire a significantly higher potential to promote local tumor growth upon cancer therapies, we
hypothesize that systemic chemotherapy treatment stimulates regenerative responses in lung resident MSCs,
which are, in turn, utilized by drug-resistant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) for their metastatic relapse in the
lung. By designing different chemotherapy treatment scenarios in animal models mimicking clinical situations
in human breast cancer patients, we will in Aim 1 determine how chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and
doxorubicin modulate the lung resident MSCs using our newly established endogenous MSC modeling
platform in mice. Subsequently, we will in Aim 2 delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-activated
lung resident MSCs to support metastatic tumor growth in the lung, with a focus on the TLR4 signaling
pathway and the key wound healing cytokine osteopontin (OPN). Finally, we will in Aim 3 define the
translational potential of stroma targeting approaches using both patient-derived xenograft models and breast
cancer patient specimen analyses. We will specifically focus on the therapeutic efficacy of combining
chemotherapy with TLR4 or OPN blockage in treatment of patient-derived human basal-like xenograft breast
tumors. Further, by analyzing clinical plasma samples from human breast cancer patients, we expect to
develop plasma OPN as a biomarker to predict early metastatic relapse of breast cancer patients after
chemotherapy. Overall, our proposed study will energize an underdeveloped field of research that investigates
the impact of cancer therapeutics on the pre-metastatic microenvironment. Findings from the proposed study
will facilitate the development of clinically applicable strategies to improve treatment efficacy and prevent
metastatic relapse of breast cancer by interfering with the tissue metastatic microenvironment."
10830247,"Neuro-flakes: Direct Voltage Imaging of Neural Activity with Atomically-thin
 Optoelectronic Materials
 Recording electrical activity of neural populations with high resolution is essential to
investigate neural circuits and cognitive functions. Although electrophysiology remains to be a
widespread tool in neuroscience, it lacks practical scalability and chronic stability needed to tackle
large-scale information processing in the brain. Penetrating electrodes are highly destructive to
the neural tissue when inserted in large numbers across multiple areas and number of channels
that can be simultaneously recorded are limited to a few hundreds, even with the most advanced
probes. On the other hand, optical technologies such as calcium imaging are capable of recording
neural activity from large populations. However, calcium transients are slow and also not a direct
representation of output information of neurons. They are a secondary marker of some electrical
and nonelectrical changes in neurons leading to significant discrepancies between electrically
recorded action potentials and calcium transients. Direct measurement of electric potentials at
multiple spatial scales is crucial to investigate information integration, distribution and processing
in the brain. Here, we propose a unique and innovative voltage imaging technology, Neuro-flakes,
for all-optical large-scale monitoring of electrical activity of neuron populations. Neuro-flakes will
combine three key innovations: (i) 3-atom thick MoS2 nanosheets will provide quantum
confinement-based excitonic photoluminescence for direct voltage sensing of neural activity
across multiple spatial scales, (ii) Planar and injectable Neuro-flakes will serve as a nontoxic,
nongenetic, and photostable alternative to genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) with a
potential for human applications in the future, and (iii) MoS2 has a radiative lifetime on the order
of several picoseconds, potentially enabling optical detection of neural activity with extraordinary
temporal resolution. Neuro-flakes will combine the advantages of electrophysiology with the
convenience of optical imaging, without the invasiveness of or the need for electrical wires, to
directly probe voltages generated by single neurons and neuronal microcircuits at multiple spatial
and temporal scales."

The importance of nutritional sciences to improving the public’s health has never been more evident. With
two-thirds of the US population overweight or obese, the burden of chronic diseases, including diabetes, is
increasing and the economic, social and human costs are significant and growing. With initiatives such as
Nutrition for Precision Health, NIH seeks to transform nutritional sciences through innovative research on
nutrition, dietary patterns and the effect of nutrition on the microbiome. There is a continuing national need for
researchers who take a multifaceted approach to solve the most pressing questions, who understand the
translation from basic to clinical levels of inquiry, and who contribute to translation of scientific discovery to
evidence-based nutrition policy and practice. The proposed training program in the Division of Nutritional
Sciences at Cornell University addresses this need by preparing trainees to produce interdisciplinary science
that can drive impact across the translational spectrum from basic sciences to clinical and public health. The
training program, with positions for 4 predoctoral trainees per year, is built on Cornell’s nutrition doctoral
program, which emphasizes multidisciplinary and integrative scholarship across the biological, physical,
behavioral, and social sciences. The 30 trainers participating in this application represent the broad range of
disciplines necessary to achieve the goals of the training program and include renowned scientists with
expertise spanning from genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry to epidemiology, psychology, and
economics. The trainers have active research programs and excellent training records. The proposed training
program includes a core curriculum (Grant Writing and Translational Research and Evidence-based Policy
and Practice in Nutrition) that is complemented by the WHO/Cochrane/Cornell Summer Institute for
Systematic Reviews in Nutrition for Global Policy Making. Trainees also submit an NIH F31 predoctoral
application and participate in three enrichment activities including monthly trainee meetings, hosting an
annual invited speaker, and organizing an annual half-day symposium. As part of the translational research
training, trainees are co-mentored for at least one project in their dissertation. To meet national needs through
doctoral training, the training program includes a combined PhD-RD training component for 1 trainee per year
that comprises the above program elements and a short translational research or policy experience. The
infrastructure to support the proposed training program is well-established, with added strengths from new
faculty members with research programs in molecular nutrition, microbiome, proteomics, computational
biology and nutrition and health inequalities. Highly successful partnerships with the World Health
Organization and Cochrane significantly enhance Cornell’s capabilities in translational science and evidence
synthesis. These new and continuing strengths support the program’s objectives to create an unparalleled
training experience in the nutritional sciences and prepare the next generation of nutrition scientists."

Aging has a complex underlying biology characterized by a progressive loss of cellular and physiological function
and this deterioration is strongly correlated with degenerative disease. In the bone marrow, aging markedly
reduces the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to self-renew and differentiate into lymphoid lineages,
resulting in hindered immune function and systemic effects on multiple tissues, such as muscle repair after injury.
Bone marrow from young recipients has been shown to rejuvenate aged bone marrow as well as systemically in
other tissues. However, the exact HSC and progenitor cell states as well as other factors that drive the
rejuvenating effects are not well understood. Profiling of HSCs and other bone marrow cell types during aging
and an understanding of the transcription factors (TFs)-that control HSC self-renewal and their changes in activity
during aging could provide new therapeutic approaches with the potential to reverse both blood-specific and
whole-animal effects of aging. TF-based interventions, such as partial reprogramming, have shown promise to
promote stem-cell cycling and regeneration. However, current approaches are limited to a small set of
predetermined TFs, commonly the Yamanaka factors Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, and have only been
demonstrated in a select set of tissues. Furthermore, the diversity of the HSC population, containing both
senescent cells and long-term renewing state (LT-HSC) among other subtypes, makes discovery of master
regulators challenging, and existing approaches do not address this heterogeneity. We hypothesize that high-
resolution single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of HSCs from mice of different ages will reveal putative TF
regulators of the aging process, and that these candidates can reprogram aged HSCs towards LT-HSC and
quiescent states capable of niche restoration to reverse age-associated phenotypes. We will profile molecular
signatures of aging in HSCs at single cell resolution and use these data to both develop metrics for aging and
nominate TFs to promote LT-HSC restoration and rejuvenation. We will synthesize selected TFs for pooled
screening allowing for rapid evaluation of their reprogramming effects in vitro and in vivo. Coupling these pooled
perturbations in vivo with scRNA-seq readouts will allow for evaluation of HSC rejuvenation via our aging
signatures and measurement of lymphoid/myeloid skew. Candidate TFs that demonstrate the strongest potential
for rejuvenation of LT-HSCs will be tested individually and in combination for modification of whole-organism
phenotypes, including increased repopulation potential, reduction of inflammatory factors, and improvement of
muscle repair in response to injury. The repurposing of novel TFs regulating HSC rejuvenation as new
therapeutics for aging-associated disease provides a new framework for cellular engineering. This proposal,
coupling transcriptomic readouts and screening for discovery of new regulators of cell states, serves as the
foundation for TF-based interventions for disease, both in aging and in broader human health."

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been shown to significantly decrease a variety of malignancy-related
mortality in the past two decades. However, concerns have been raised due to their potential vascular toxicity
that could lead to hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial diseases. Despite these
safety concerns, the mechanisms underlying TKI-induced vascular toxicity (TKI-VT) are poorly understood. To
overcome this challenge, we propose to leverage human iPSCs, state-of-the-art multi-omics methods, and
CRISPR screening to investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms of TKI-VT and identify druggable targets
that can be further tested in animal models. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will comprehensively profile human-induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac pericytes (iPSC-PCs), an important but rarely explored cardiac cell type, to
define cellular mechanisms of TKI-VT. In Aim 2, we will evaluate how TKIs induce disrupted cellular crosstalk
between iPSC-PCs and iPSC-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) by performing integrative omics on a 3D
vessel-on-chip (VoC) model. Finally, in Aim 3, we will perform CRISPR screening on TKI-treated iPSC-PCs and
iPSC-ECs to identify potential druggable targets and validate their therapeutic efficacy in mice. Successful
completion of these studies will lead to novel mechanistic insights into TKI-VT pathogenesis and help develop
promising therapeutic strategies that can prevent and/or treat TKI-VT in cancer patients. Moreover, this proposal
will help define the role of TKIs in vascular pathophysiology, which may have broad scientific and clinical
implications beyond cardio-oncology."

The Y chromosome encoded zinc finger gene, Zfy, has once been in the center of attention as a potential candidate for
the testis-determining factor. When the fame went to another Y chromosome gene, Sry, Zfy was quickly forgotten, and it
has taken more than two decades for it to re-emerge with newly ascribed spermiogenic roles, some of which were crucial
for Y chromosome evolution. The mouse Y chromosome has two Zfy copies, Zfy1 and Zfy2, both with potential to act as a
transcription factor and with postnatal expression restricted to spermatogenic cells. Current evidence, including some
from our lab, supports the role of Zfy genes in male reproduction. Yet, nothing is known about the molecular mechanism
whereby ZFY1 and ZFY2 impose their important roles.
Our goal is to fill this gap in knowledge and define how ZFY regulate mouse spermatogenesis. We propose, and will test,
a hypothesis that that mouse ZFY proteins are essential regulators of spermatogenesis and male fertility.
In Specific Aim 1 we will use Zfy KO mice that we recently developed to identify the consequences of Zfy loss on transcript
and protein expression in purified spermatogenic cells: primary spermatocytes (sc1), secondary spermatocytes (sc2),
round spermatids (rs), and sperm (sp) using RNA-seq and mass spectrometry.
In Specific Aim 2, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to add epitope tags via knock-in to Zfy1 and Zfy2 genes. Using these new mouse
models, we will identify ZFY chromatin and protein binding targets in purified spermatogenic cells (sc1, sc2 and rs).
In Specific Aim 3, we will integrate the findings from Aim 1 and 2 to define the gene and protein network regulated by ZFY
in mouse testis and perform downstream molecular, biochemical, and functional assays on selected genes and pathways
regulated by ZFY.
In preparation for this project, we performed a pilot RNA-seq analysis and have shown that Zfy loss results in significant
changes of germ cell transcriptome. We also developed mice with tagged ZFY proteins and showed that they can be
immunoprecipitated.
The project will fill a gap in knowledge regarding the molecular function of an essential and conserved Y chromosome-
encoded male fertility factor, ZFY, which arose due to inability to reliably detect ZFY proteins and lack of methods to
genetically modify Y chromosome. The findings will impact on understanding of how mouse Y chromosome Zfy regulate
spermatogenesis, providing insights the role of the human ZFY and the mechanisms underlying human male infertility."
10856492,"0BPROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlighted the continual threat of emerging and re-emerging
pandemic-potential pathogens and the critical value of coordinated multidisciplinary basic and translational
research for pandemic preparedness. There is an urgent need for an integrated collaborative effort to build a
robust basic research and translational science portfolio for preparedness against high-risk viral families
including Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Bunyavirales. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID) is supporting the development of the Research and Development of Vaccines and
Monoclonal Antibodies for Pandemic Preparedness (ReVAMPP) Network to fill this critical gap. The overall
goal of this new collaborative Network, consisting of a Coordinating and Data Sharing Center (CDSC) and
six to eight Research Centers, is to collaboratively produce generalizable knowledge that enables a rapid
response when previously understudied or unknown pathogens emerge. RTI International’s well-established
track record implementing large-scale domestic and international coordinating and data management
centers, including in the emerging infectious disease ecosystem, makes us well qualified to develop and
provide Network governance, communications, and data sharing and analysis as the ReVAMPP CDSC. The
overall goal of the RTI-based CDSC is to establish and maintain an integrated Network to accelerate
discovery and dissemination of novel vaccine and monoclonal antibody strategies to prepare for the next
pandemic outbreak. To accomplish this goal, RTI proposes a CDSC organizational structure, consisting of
two interconnected teams under mPIs and a Project Director—an Administration and Leadership Team, and
a Data Management and Analysis Team. This structure leverages RTI multidisciplinary experts and will
provide ReVAMPP Centers, NIAID, and stakeholders centralized administrative, communication, and
operational support for Network-wide activities, while also establishing data sharing and analysis standards
and platforms. The Specific Aims of the RTI-based CDSC align with these two teams and will use both
established and novel innovative approaches and technologies to (Aim 1) coordinate preparatory vaccine
and antibody strategy research by establishing and maintaining ReVAMPP Network governance,
administration, and communication; and (Aim 2) accelerate transparent collaborative vaccine and antibody
strategy research by developing and maintaining a secure ReVAMPP Network Private Portal that includes
centralized resource, data sharing, and reporting systems. This independent, but integrated team of
administrators, communicators, and data science experts embedded within the ReVAMPP Network as the
CDSC, will coordinate, facilitate, and empower Network investigators and NIAID to proactively prepare to
rapidly share information with key stakeholders across the globe when new viral pandemic/outbreaks occur."
10830970,"The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is higher in African Americans (AAs) compared with US whites
(NHWs) overall, but the disparity is more extreme in persons with earlier age of onset. The median age of
onset is 65 in AAs compared to 72 in NHWs, and early-onset CRC is more than twice as frequent in AAs than
in NHWs. In addition, epidemiologic evidence suggests that younger age CRCs may have a more rapid
progression through the steps of carcinogenesis. Yet, younger age CRC is not well characterized in any
population, and we have no explanation for its higher incidence in AAs. In a recent genomic analysis of a
series of Chicago African American CRC cases, we found an excess of CRCs lacking mutation in the tumor
suppressor gene APC (APC mutation-negative CRCs). Microsatellite stable APC mutation-negative CRCs
were associated with younger age of diagnosis, fewer numbers of somatic mutations, and microsatellite and
chromosome stability. Importantly, we discovered that APC mutation-negative CRCs exhibited a novel
methylation profile characterized by increased levels of methylation in key cancer driver genes including those
in stem-cell maintenance and the WNT signaling pathway. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
epigenetic dysregulation in APC mutation-negative CRCs drives specific DNA methylation changes and gene
regulatory networks that maintain a stem-like cancer phenotype. The overall goal of the project is to
characterize the molecular mechanisms that drive this novel subtype of CRCs. We have three aims. Aim 1.
Identify and characterize significant differentially methylated regions in AA CRC. Hypothesis: Tumor-
specific differentially methylated regions are associated with carcinogenesis in APC mutation-negative CRCs.
APC mutation-negative CRCs will be associated with earlier age of onset and with distinct molecular and
clinicopathological features. Aim 2. Identify and characterize differentially expressed genes and
regulatory networks in AA CRCs. Hypothesis: Specific regulatory networks that maintain a stem-like cancer
phenotype are associated with APC mutation-negative CRCs. Aim 3. Determine driver gene dependencies
of AA CRCs in organoid cancer models. Hypothesis: Suppression of specific WNT signaling factors and
epigenetic modulators will induce increased epithelial differentiation in APC mutation-negative organoids in
comparison to APC mutation-positive organoids. The proposed studies will provide essential knowledge of the
DNA methylation and gene expression changes underlying AA CRCs and will characterize cancer cell
responses to chemical challenge. The new knowledge will provide translatable information, including
diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and precision-medicine approaches, that could be used to treat a novel
subtype of CRC that occurs in excess in AAs and is associated with earlier age of onset."
10830971,"Among U.S race/ethnic groups over 75 years of age, African Americans exhibit the highest cognitive impairment
prevalence (32%) followed by Hispanics (23%) and Non-Hispanic Whites (10%). Our proposal implements
multiple novel genomic tools designed to capture ethnic-specific targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD) within the mitochondrial DNA. A novel aspect of our proposal is that we can rapidly translate
human mitochondrial genetic associations into cellular and animal experimental paradigms and infer whether
these mtSNPs modify mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs), which are a group of micro-peptides that display
profound effects on metabolic and neurodegenerative disease processes. We provide evidence in this proposal
that we have already identified three mtSNPs in Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics that
associate with AD phenotypes in an ethnic-specific fashion through MDPs. In this proposal, we will conduct
several novel genetic analyses: (1) Mitochondrial Genome Wide Association Studies (MiWAS), (2) Mitochondrial
Genome Wide GxE and GxG Interaction Studies (MiWIS), and (3) mitochondria RNASeq differential expression
analysis (mito-transcriptomics), in three large, longitudinal multi-ethnic cohorts with comparable repeated
measures of cognitive decline as well as lifestyle and metabolic factors (e.g., body mass index, diabetes, and
physical activity). Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and REasons for Geographic And Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohorts, we will conduct discovery MiWAS and MiWIS for Non-Hispanic
Whites (n~14,300), African Americans (n~13,400), and Hispanics (n~2,420). We will test replication of findings
from HRS and REGARDS on cognitive decline and diagnosis of clinical AD using the diverse Rush Alzheimer's
Disease Center (RADC) cohorts (n~4,500). We will conduct mito-transcriptomics for all ethnic groups in HRS
(n~4,000; white blood cells) and in RADC (n~640; brain prefrontal cortex). Our central hypothesis is that specific
mtSNPs and mitochondrial gene expression will predict clinical AD diagnosis and cognitive decline differently by
ethnicity. For this project, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team to: 1) Identify ethnic-specific mtSNPs
that predict cognitive decline, ADRD, and AD. 2) Identify ethnic-specific mtSNPs that interact with lifestyle factors
or nuclear SNPs to affect cognitive decline, ADRD, and AD. 3) Investigate whether genes that encode
mitochondrial-derived peptides are differentially expressed relative to AD or ADRD status in different ethnicities.
 This project permits discovery of mitochondrial genetic targets that can be explored as precision-based,
ethnic-specific, potential ADRD treatment targets, in the form of micro-peptides derived from the mitochondria.
Findings from this proposal will be instrumental to AD therapeutic discovery because the makeup of the national
population is becoming more ethnically diverse."
10831051,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite the availability of effective treatments, glaucoma remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness
among African American adults and the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in the United States.
Non-adherence to daily prescribed eye drop medications – the treatment for 89% of glaucoma patients - is a
key modifiable driver of vision loss in glaucoma. In current practice, patients are diagnosed with glaucoma and
simply given a prescription, with only 1 in 8 prescribing physicians teaching patients how to use eye drops.
40% of glaucoma patients do not take their daily eye drop medication according to the prescribed schedule.
20% of glaucoma patients do not succeed in getting drops into their eyes. Glaucoma primarily affects older
adults who may have aging-related sensorimotor deficits that impair successful medication instillation. Our
long term goal is to develop a comprehensive system to monitor medication use, quantify whether
administered drops are successfully delivered, communicate usage data to the patient’s health care team, and
coach each patient on how to use their eye drop medications. Our central hypothesis is that by identifying the
biomechanical and sensorimotor factors associated with eye drop instillation success – whether a drop gets in
the eye – we can develop more effective, personalized intervention strategies to improve medication
adherence and increase instillation success. Our overall objectives are to: 1) use motion sensors that
measure the biomechanical movement of instilling eye drops, together with tests of sensorimotor abilities, to
identify factors that result in successful eye drop instillation success among older adults; and 2) use input from
older participants to design a comprehensive, simple, and user-friendly Eye Drop Adherence Monitoring
System (EAMS). The EAMS will consist of a low-power, portable, on-bottle sensor and a cellular-linked
communication base station to identify remotely when an eye drop was dispensed and record the probability of
successful instillation. The EAMS will also integrate a personalized text message program tailored to individual
adherence levels. Following development, we will test the EAMS to assess the agreement between EAMS
classification of an eye drop use event and eye drop instillation success and an eye drop use diary and video-
recorded eye drop instillation. We will assess the acceptability of the system among a sample of glaucoma
patients through qualitative interviews. Impact: Our interdisciplinary team will gain and share new knowledge
about the biomechanics of eye drop instillation and the impact of the sensorimotor deficits of aging on eye drop
medication use. This knowledge will inform the development of a scalable Eye Drop Adherence Monitoring
System (EAMS) that can be used clinically to improve the effectiveness of glaucoma care in preventing vision
loss. This tool will be able to assess adherence to eye drop medications in both the clinical and research
settings. A deeper understanding will inform patient-centered approaches to self-management support and aid
in closing outcomes disparities in glaucoma – and every other condition needing eye drop medications."
10831052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ongoing development and validation of screening and diagnostic tools has been a major focus of research in
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) during the past 30 years. Diagnostic validity of several widely used tools has
been established by showing that, in most cases, children with ASD score above established cut-offs, whereas
children with non-ASD score below cut-offs. However, a growing body of literature indicates that sensitivity and
specificity of ASD symptom measures varies significantly based on the characteristics of the study population.
This means that the ability of a given tool to differentiate children with and without ASD is variable, and is affected
by an individual's demographic (age, sex), developmental (cognitive ability, language level), and/or behavioral
(clinically significant behavior problems) profile.
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to transform screening and diagnostic practices through
increased individualization of measure selection and interpretation. Phenotypic heterogeneity of youth referred
for possible ASD is a well-recognized challenge that prevents one-size-fits-all assessment approaches from
being validly employed. Yet, with ever-growing demands for such services, clinical and research entities
increasingly rely on specified batteries to make decisions about triage and diagnosis. While use of standardized
tools offers many advantages, uniform application or interpretation of specific instruments disregards the vast
individual heterogeneity that is a hallmark of ASD. Thus, the field is in need of updated practices, wherein tools
are selected, combined, and interpreted in the context of an individual child's presentation, with specific reference
to how likely it is that scores on a given test or combination of tests will indicate ASD caseness for that child.
Toward this end, the proposed secondary data analysis will identify which tools, and combinations of tools, work
best for identifying ASD in sub-groups of youth with shared demographic, developmental, and/or behavioral
phenotypes (e.g., in toddler girls with phrase speech vs. verbally fluent adolescent boys with clinically elevated
behavior problems). We will analyze data from several widely-used ASD measures, aggregated from more than
17,500 children between the ages of 18 months and 17 years, 11 months. These youth were either clinically
referred for ASD diagnostic assessment, assessed due to heightened risk for ASD or other developmental
delays, or recruited for ASD-focused research projects. They were assigned a best-estimate diagnosis of ASD
or non-ASD (e.g., intellectual disability, ADHD, language disorder) by expert clinicians or clinical-researchers
following a comprehensive assessment. By considering the interplay between individual characteristics and
instrument scores in the largest sample to date, the proposed study will move the field toward more individualized
approaches for establishing ASD caseness. Findings from this study will also directly inform the development of
the next generation of tools, procedures, and electronic platforms for diagnostic assessment of ASD."

Gene editing holds the promise of enhancing the precision and safety of anti-HIV gene therapies based on
engineering hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), in order to recreate elements of the Berlin Patient
cure. Targeted nuclease technology is already being used to exploit NHEJ-mediated repair of DNA breaks and
thereby disrupt the CCR5 gene, which mimics one aspect of his cure. However, extending this treatment to non-
cancer patients, receiving engineered autologous HSPC, will likely need to include other approaches. To do this,
we are exploiting the alternate pathway of DNA break repair based on homology-directed repair (HDR). This can
be used to introduce gain-of-function mutations into cellular restriction factors, or to direct the controlled secretion
of soluble anti-viral factors, including the broad entry inhibitor eCD4-Ig. Moreover, the site-specific insertion at
eCD4-Ig at the CCR5 locus would combine HIV-resistance with systemic protection and thereby provide a
combinatorial anti-HIV approach. In the current proposal we aim to continue to improve the safety and efficacy
of gene editing in HSPC, and to apply the technology to provide both local and systemic HIV resistance. We will
combine our established anti-HIV approaches with a new direction to engineer production of broadly neutralizing
antibodies, and thereby provide a novel synthetic immune capability. Individual strategies and combination
approaches will be evaluated in appropriate humanized mouse models, to evaluate their impact on HIV infection
and the latent reservoir."

10854278,"Project Summary: Acquisition of a CytoFLEX LX Flow Cytometer
The Integrated Imaging Center (IIC) at Johns Hopkins University is applying to purchase a
Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX LX flow cytometer to replace an existing BD FACSCalibur instrument.
The existing instrument has reached the end of its service life. The CytoFLEX has a number of
major upgrades allowing significantly more experimental modalities to be used. These include
more lasers, many more analysis parameters, small particle size measurements with a side
scatter detector, absolute concentration measurements and the option of a multi-well plate
compatible autoloader. This instrument will be used for a range of ongoing research projects
including work on kinetically assembled nanoparticles for mRNA delivery in cancer treatment,
the study of Alzheimer disease progression, the characterization of photoreceptor development
pathways, how DNA replication influences epigenomics in stem cells and the use of nucleic acid
nanotubes to treat primary and metastatic tumors.
These projects will directly benefit from the expansion of the number of parameters available
for analysis, allow many more signals to be simultaneously measured, and much better data on
complex interaction between multiple components. This will generate equivalent or better data
from many fewer experiments, when many components are involved. By having more laser
sources, we will have more flexibility in dye choices and the ability to truly use the high
parameter analysis possible on this machine. The addition of a 96-well plate auto-loader will
allow much higher throughput of samples and dramatically reduce preparation time as many
experimental workflows already use 96 well plates for sample preparation, enabling these
plates to be simply loaded into the flow cytometer rather than transferred into tubes for
analysis.
Overall, this instrument will enable a range of new experiments and increase the productivity of
existing experimental workflows. This will increase our basic understanding of a range of
cellular processes and help speed the translation of emerging therapeutics from the lab to the
clinic."
10854279,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) virus has left a large cohort of individuals suffering
from ongoing neurological sequelae known as neuro-COVID. The condition involves CoV2 neurotropism and
long-term inflammatory responses, including increases in neurodegenerative and neurotoxic proteins such as
tau. Despite progress made, the molecular mechanisms underlying CoV2-induced tauopathy are unknown.
Aging activates innate immune mechanisms and inflammation, and the latter has been linked to tau pathology.
Together these observations have provided a strong scientific premise for this proposal, which aims to investigate
CoV2-induced molecular changes in the context of aging and tauopathy to identify critical mechanisms
underlying the development of neuro-COVID symptoms using mouse models. To this end, data in a mouse-
adapted CoV2-MA10 virus infection in C57BL/6 mice show increased expression of genes involved in
neuroinflammation and tauopathy risk that increase with age, which models neuro-COVID seen in the patient’s
brains. Our preliminary studies led to the identification of two groups of proteins: one involved in protein
misfolding/tauopathy (FKBP51) and the other related to innate immune activation including genes involved in
IFN regulation (IFI204). Our studies also showed that CoV2-MA10 accelerates tau pathology in PS19 tau
transgenic mice, establishing a model to further study tauopathy mechanisms that are accelerated by CoV2.
Most notably, intranasal instillation of dendriplexes (DPX) comprising dendrimers and plasmid encoding short
hairpin RNA (pshRNA) for the lead target FKBP51 in MA10-infected C57BL6 mice significantly reduced
neuroinflammation, and expression of FKBP51 and Tau phosphorylation. These findings lead to the central
hypothesis that age-dependent CoV2 neuro-invasion-induced tau pathology is caused by innate immune
activation and elevated FKBP51 expression. We further hypothesize that CoV2 infection induces similar
inflammation and protein misfolding in PS19 tauopathic mice, accelerating neuropathology and cognitive deficits.
These hypotheses will be tested in the following two specific aims. SA #1 will assess age as a primary variable
that exacerbates inflammation leading to tauopathy and long-term cognitive decline in C57BL/6 mice following
CoV2-MA10 infection. SA #2 will examine the progression of tauopathy in PS19 transgenic mice following CoV2-
MA10 Infection. Each of these aims will: i) characterize neuropathology and behavior; ii) identify target
mechanisms underlying the pathology and neuro-COVID sequelae using spatial transcriptomic profiling; and iii)
validate the role of FKBP51, IFI204 and other novel leads in neuropathological and cognitive consequences,
using DPX formulations carrying pshRNA for these leads. This multi-PI and multi-disciplinary approach to
understanding the mechanisms leading to neuro-COVID is expected to expand our basic knowledge and identify
new mechanistic targets increasing our understanding of the impact of CoV2 on pre-existing age-related or
genetically pre-disposed neurodegeneration."
10853200,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is the primary cause of dementia, the mechanisms
of AD have not been completely elucidated and there has yet to yield effective therapy that can prevent, stop or
reverse cognitive deficits associated with AD. Epigenetics refers to functional modifications to the genome that
do not involve a change in the DNA sequence. Epigenetics became an attractive field in recent years within the
drug discovery research communities. Recent preclinical studies also provide robust evidence for the
involvement of HDACs in various neurological diseases, and pharmacological treatment aimed at modulating
epigenetic regulation. The goal of this application is to develop novel small molecules as HDAC11 selective
inhibitor as potential AD therapeutics. In this proposal, we will explore SAR of our leading scaffold to develop a
new generation of HDAC11-selective inhibitors (Aim 1), which will be tested to select top compounds with
improved PK/PD properties and anti-AD effects using AD preclinical models (Aim 2). Towards the ultimate goal
of developing novel HDAC11 inhibitors as effective AD treatments, the end-point of this application is to identify
top candidates for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies."
10853744,"SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate of only ~12%.
Therefore, there is a critical unmet need for new treatment options. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells
have led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of some hematologic cancers, but efficacy in solid tumors remains
limited, partly due to the lack of highly specific targets and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
(TME). Moreover, the time required and the high cost of manufacturing an autologous cell product, and the
toxicity of CAR-T cells call for novel products that are universal, safe, and potent. CAR-NK cells have emerged
as a promising cell therapy for cancer due to the NK cells’ innate ability to kill tumor cells and their safety in the
allogeneic setting. In a first-in-human study, our group showed the safety and efficacy of cord blood (CB)-derived
CAR-NK cells targeting CD19 in B-lymphoid malignancies. This proposal aims to build on this platform to develop
the next-generation NK cell therapies for PDAC by enhancing NK cell potency and persistence through optimal
co-stimulatory signaling, cytokine armoring and checkpoint inhibition. We have identified TROP2 as a promising
therapeutic target in PDAC and developed a novel strategy to target TROP2 by genetically modifying CB-NK
cells with a retroviral vector encoding: (i) the humanized RS7 scFv targeting TROP2; (ii) DAP10 as an NK-
specific co-stimulatory domain; (iii) IL-15 to support their survival and proliferation; and (iv) inducible caspase-9
(iC9) as a safety switch (iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15). Our data show the efficacy and safety of this approach in vitro
and in vivo and support its translation to the clinic. In addition, we have developed a robust strategy for the
cryopreservation of CAR-NK cells, enabling the generation of a biobank of off-the-shelf engineered NK cells that
could be thawed and infused at bedside, thus reducing cost and increasing accessibility. We have manufactured
and cryopreserved 125 patient doses of GMP-grade iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells and a clinical study to test
the safety and efficacy of this off-the-shelf product in PDAC was recently approved by the FDA (Protocol 2022-
0687; IND 29348). Finally, we have devised a novel strategy to target the immune metabolic checkpoint CREM
to modulate the metabolic fitness and potency of CAR-NK cells in the PDAC TME. We hypothesize that targeting
TROP2 with iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells will greatly improve outcomes in PDAC and that by deleting the
metabolic immune checkpoint CREM we can further enhance the fitness and potency of NK cells. We will test
our hypothesis in three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial to test the safety and
efficacy of intraperitoneally delivered iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells in patients with TROP2+ PDAC. In Aim 2
we will apply innovative single-cell transcriptomics and spatial proteomics to comprehensively characterize the
fate of the adoptively transferred CAR-NK cells and their interaction with other cells within the TME, to uncover
key mechanisms of efficacy and resistance. In Aim 3 we will investigate the mechanism by which targeting CREM
enhances the antitumor activity of iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells in an orthotopic PDX mouse model of PDAC."
10845545,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Despite reductions in prevalence over the last few decades, over 34 million Americans currently smoke
cigarettes, and tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death, disability, and disease. Among
smokers who achieve abstinence, post-cessation weight gain (PCWG) is common and attributed to increased
energy intake in the first weeks and months after quitting. PCWG is problematic for three reasons. First, many
smokers, especially women, report fear of PCWG as a major barrier to quitting. Second, PCWG can precipitate
a relapse. Third PCWG can contribute to the onset of a chronic illness, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes
mellitus. First-line treatments, i.e. nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), varenicline and bupropion help
people quit smoking but do not provide a clinically meaningful impact on PCWG. Our recent pilot work showed
that a 6-week treatment with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, extended-release exenatide,
as an adjunct to nicotine patch, improved abstinence and decreased PCWG in prediabetic and/or overweight
treatment-seeking smokers. These findings, which are consistent with preclinical reports that GLP-1R agonists
decrease the rewarding effects of nicotine and food, support GLP-1R as a promising target for facilitating
smoking cessation and decreasing PCWG. The proposed research will assess the efficacy of extended-release
exenatide as an adjunct to nicotine patch on smoking abstinence and PCWG during the first 3 months after
quitting, when most weight gain occurs. A double-blind trial is proposed in which treatment-seeking smokers
will be randomized to receive either 2 mg exenatide (once a week) or placebo as an adjunct to nicotine patch for
14 weeks, starting 2 weeks prior to target quit day. The primary outcome measures will be end-of-treatment
smoking abstinence (4-week continuous) and PCWG. We predict that exenatide will improve abstinence and
mitigate PCWG relative to placebo. Exploratory aims will examine the long-term (6 months) impact of
exenatide on the primary study outcomes and the effect of exenatide on neuroaffective responses to food- and
nicotine-related stimuli. Innovative aspects of this research include: 1) targeting GLP-1R to facilitate smoking
cessation and decrease PCWG; 2) testing an approved medication that could be deployed quickly as an
adjunctive treatment for use in combination with NRT; 3) providing the impetus for conducting pivotal Phase 3
clinical trials to establish the efficacy of exenatide-NRT combinations and 4) exploring a putative mechanism
implicated in exenatide's effects on smoking and PCWG. This project stands to contribute significantly to
current treatments for smoking cessation by identifying a first-in-class adjunct pharmacotherapeutic that
uniquely targets both cessation and weight gain. This R01 resubmission application is proposed by an early-
stage investigator who has assembled a team of scientists with relevant expertise and access to resources,
including two-site recruitment capabilities, to ensure timely enrollment and successful completion of a large
sample size (N=216)."
10845546,"ABSTRACT
Quantifying aging is a major goal in Geroscience research as the availability of a reliable marker of aging can
facilitate understanding of the fundamental biology of aging, enable tracking of the aging process in different
tissues and cell systems, and support identification and validation of interventions that extend lifespan and
healthspan. Traditionally, aging has been monitored by following chronological age, mortality, age-related
changes in gene expression, and/or other molecular features, however, there is currently no consensus on the
best practices for quantitatively tracking progression through aging. The recent advent of biomarkers based on
advanced omics approaches, such as DNA methylation, have provided some hope to support development of
precise estimates of age, both in humans and mice. Nevertheless, the majority of such measures are trained as
chronological age predictors, with little to no integration of biological, functional, or phenotypic data. Further, the
modifiability of aging measures based on DNA methylation in response to lifespan and healthspan extending
interventions is almost entirely unknown. We propose to address these challenges by developing a series of
novel DNA methylation clocks by integrating information on phenotypic and functional aging, investigating links
between DNA methylation and aging hallmarks, and evaluating DNA methylation responses to longevity
interventions. We suggest that these clocks will offer a much-needed resource for the Geroscience community.
We will develop these clocks using three general approaches. First, we will use cultured cells (MEFs) to induce
or establish models of three well-known hallmarks of aging—cellular senescence, DNA damage, and
mitochondrial dysregulation. We will then train epigenetic predictors of these hallmarks and validate them in vivo.
We will also establish epigenetic alterations in response to novel and established longevity interventions. In doing
so, we will develop biomarkers of intervention response that can be used to test mimetics, and/or optimize aging
biomarkers. Finally, building on the highly characterized SLAM colony of C57Bl/6 and UM-HET3 animals, we will
produce longitudinal methylation data across the lifespan that can be used to develop an epigenetic clock that
can serve as a robust predictor of healthspan. We hypothesize that these new clocks will better capture biological
age than chronological age trained clocks. Given that they were developed to capture different facets associated
with the aging process, they can be combined to create a single aging measure that is more biologically informed
and characterized compared to existing epigenetic clocks."

LatiNET will use a multilevel social network model to examine how SARS-CoV-2 misinformation and
Conspiracy Theory (CT) messages are shared across five settings (friends, family, work, health service and
influencers), impacting Latinx vaccine hesitancy. Social networks are self-organizing social systems that create
and reinforce perceptions, both positive and negative. An important gap in current knowledge relates to the
content, context and communication direction about SARS-CoV-2 misinformation and CT messages. By
learning how Latinx social network structures hinder or promote SARS-CoV-2 misinformation and CT
messages, we will inform the design of interventions that will reduce mistrust/fear and provide correct, timely,
and comprehensive information, through multiple social network sources, enabling Latinx to make the best
health decisions for themselves and their families. LatiNET will focus on low-income Latinx, which have long
struggled with social, economic and health inequalities. Miami-Dade County, Florida will be the site for this
study, where almost 100% of residents from in wealthiest areas have received at least one SARS-CoV-2
vaccine dose while fewer than a third of residents in poorer communities, mainly inhabited by Latinx
individuals, have been vaccinated.1 We have also identified that misinformation and CT messages are
prevalent in Florida.2 We will use Dr. Kanamori’s (PI) K99/R00 social network approaches3-8 and Drs.
Uscinski’s and Stoler’s (Co-Is) misinformation and CT message framework2,9-11 to identify how network
structures and dynamics introduce and spread misinformation and CT messages that could then influence
Latinx vaccine hesitancy. We will also identify network structures and dynamics that promote discussion
against SARS-CoV-2 misinformation and CT messages. LatiNET will study: 1) participants’ characteristics, 2)
624 friendship sociocentric networks, 3) 1,872 egocentric networks (family, work and health service), and 4)
influencer networks, all of which will be part of our adapted NIMHD framework.12 Our AIMS are: 1) Determine
how network structures and dynamics inside Latinx friendship networks shape the spread and adoption of
misinformation and CT messages associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. 2) Distinguish homophily
and dyadic characteristics and dynamics associated with misinformation and CT messages shared with family
members, co-workers and health service providers. 3) Identify Latinx affiliations with community, celebrity,
public health, political influencer and communication channels that spread CT and anti-CT messages. In all AIMS,
we will also study the underlying social and structural factors associated with Latinx health decision-making
(e.g., discrimination, stigma, intimate partner violence) and beliefs and behaviors tied to misinformation and CT
messages (e.g., individual-level political, psychological, and social factors). LatiNET will provide new
information that can inform policy and the design of future interventions to reduce the impact of misinformation
and CT messages on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy nationwide, and also with different priority populations."

10846835,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA methylation is an essential mediator of genome function. But considering the prevalence and distribution
of sites of methylation across the genome, exactly how DNA methylation drives cellular phenotype is unclear.
Although mammalian genomes are highly methylated, hypomethylated hotspots are scattered throughout non-
coding regions and frequently coincide with open chromatin and other gene regulatory landmarks. DNA
methylation is considered repressive to transcription, and gene regulatory elements are thought to require
demethylation to promote transcription of lineage-specifying genes. Thus, hypomethylated regions (HMRs) of
differentiated cells spotlight regions of past or present transcription factor occupancy, flagging key gene
regulatory elements involved in lineage specification (cell history) or cell-type specific gene regulation. Recent
work from our lab comparing methylation profiles across diverse cell-types demonstrates that HMR patterns are
highly predictive of cellular phenotypes. Moreover, we have discovered that cell-type specific HMRs are enriched
for genetic variants linked to specific clinical phenotypes. Together these data suggest HMRs provide important
contextual information for genome function, and when combined with human trait data, HMRs provide a powerful
means to connect genotypes to phenotypes. The objective of this proposal is to understand the functional
significance of cell-type and lineage specific HMRs and their causal relationship with genes and cellular
phenotypes. We propose that cell-type essential HMRs harbor genetic variants linked to cell-type-related
phenotypes. We further propose that, by understanding this relationship, we will uncover new hypomethylation-
dependent gene regulatory relationships that are critical for normal cell identity and function. We will perform
comparative DNA methylation profiling of diverse cell types to identify cell specific HMRs. To elucidate HMR
function, we will apply an unbiased, cutting-edge genetic approach that uses human population genetics to link
HMR genotypes to human traits recorded in the electronic health record (EHR), the most extensive repository of
phenotypic conditions of any model organism. In parallel we will probe the functional activities of HMR-defined
genomic sequences using a powerful, multi-omic approach developed by our lab to isolate “driver” HMRs in
specific cell contexts. Finally, we will use epigenome editing to understand the importance of hypomethylation
on local genome regulation. This multi-level approach will test the hypothesis that cell-type and lineage specific
HMRs are critical elements bridging genomes to phenomes. Ultimately, these studies will establish a
fundamentally new way to understand how DNA methylation bridges the connection between genomes and
phenomes, revealing important gene regulatory principles that are essential to understanding why epigenetic
instability leads to specific disease outcomes."
10846639,"Project Summary
 This project aims to solve numerous challenges in aryne difunctionalization en route to highly decorated
arene rings, critical components of most pharmaceuticals. Currently, methods to functionalize arenes in multiple
positions require iterative coupling reactions. Difunctionalization of arynes provides an attractive strategy to
incorporate multiple functional groups into an arene ring. Unfortunately, these reactions are plagued with
problems with accessing starting materials due to multistep syntheses, limited reaction scope, and poor site
selectivity for the two possible positions of the triple bond in an aryne.
 Our group aims to overcome all of these challenges by using transition metal catalysis to expand the
scope and utility of aryne difunctionalization. We plan to use C1 symmetric ligands in order to control
regioselectivity of the functional group addition to the aryne. Additionally, by the introduction of transition metal
catalysis with new aryne precursors that have previously never been used in catalysis, we will allow access to
aryne rings that were previously inaccessible due to ring strain. The transition metal catalyst will be able to bind
to the aryne and relieve ring strain. Finally, a wide variety of new difunctionalization reactions are proposed.
These new reactions encompass additions of F, N, and CF3 groups due to their importance in medicinal
chemistry.
 If the goals of this proposal are achieved, we anticipate that this chemistry will provide easy access to a
wide variety of highly functionalized arene rings. These will provide important building blocks and opportunities
for late stage functionalization of medically relevant molecules."
10846653,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Opioid use disorders pose a substantial public health burden, with consistently high rates of morbidity
and mortality. Though many interventions exist, all modalities suffer some degree of treatment nonadherence
and response failure, which suggests a need for more effective solutions. When bound to Gi-coupled Mu opioid
receptors (MuORs) in ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABAergic neurons, opioids cause disinhibition of VTA
dopaminergic neurons, which then increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key driver
of reward signaling in the brain. Various methods of modulating VTA activity have been found to modify
opioid-seeking behavior, but little work has been done to take this information in a therapeutic direction.
Inspired by recent work using inhibitory DREADDs to attenuate heroin seeking behavior, this project seeks to
utilize the MuOR itself as a means to inhibit reward signaling in a way that has clear translational value.
 The MuOR mutation D114(2.50)N is one of the best characterized variants of this receptor, and is
known to exhibit a significant reduction in binding affinity and potency for various opioid ligands compared to
the wild-type receptor. This mutant, which will be referred to as LAMuOR (Low Affinity Mu Opioid Receptor),
may be exploited to create a genetically encoded tool that, when expressed in the VTA, inhibits the response of
the reward pathway to exogenously administered opioids, while remaining unresponsive to endogenous
ligands. Thus, the goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that LAMuOR suppresses opioid taking by
responding preferentially to opioids of abuse – such as during fentanyl self-administration – while remaining
unresponsive during physiological reward signaling. If successful, LAMuOR may ultimately prove to be a novel
translational strategy by which a single treatment could confer life-long protection from opioid use disorders."

!
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) was responsible for more than 1.6 million deaths in 2017, making it a
leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Currently, Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is
the only licensed vaccine for tuberculosis. BCG provides protection against disseminated forms of the disease
in children but is inconsistent in preventing the development of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. Since adults
with pulmonary tuberculosis are highly infectious, control of the epidemic will not be achieved with BCG, and
new vaccines are urgently needed. A number of lines of evidence from human and animal studies have revealed
the critical importance of T cells in conferring protective immunity to M.tb. However, we still do not know which
M.tb antigens are targeted by the T cells that confer protection. This information is critical to developing new
vaccines that are more effective than BCG. Classically, T cells are activated by foreign peptide antigens that
are bound to highly polymorphic major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. Alternatively, mycobacterial cell wall
lipids have conclusively been shown to activate human T cells when bound to CD1 proteins on antigen-
presenting cells. The CD1 system has been shown to mediate protective T-cell responses in mouse models of
autoimmunity, cancer, and infectious diseases. However, the lack of an appropriate animal model has impeded
research into the importance of CD1-restricted T cells in the pathogenesis of M.tb. Tools to identify CD1-
restricted T cells were also unavailable until recently. Over the last ten years, we have established lipid-loaded
CD1 tetramers as tools to study the phenotypes and functions of CD1-restricted T cells in humans. We have
also developed and validated a humanized CD1 transgenic (hCD1Tg) mouse model and shown that T-cells
specific for mycolic acid, a major constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall, confer protective immunity to M.tb
challenge. Finally, we are now also developing CD1 tetramers for non-human primate (NHP) models of TB.
These preliminary data establish the feasibility of developing small and large animal models for studying the role
of CD1-restricted T cells in TB pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will validate a suite of human CD1 tetramers loaded
with synthetic lipid antigens and determine the tissue-specific phenotypes and functions of CD1-restricted T cells
after mycobacterial vaccination or infection of hCD1Tg mice and NHP. In Aim 2, we will explore whether BCG
administered by different routes (cutaneous, aerosol, or intravenous) or primary M.tb infection induces lipid-
specific T cells that confer protective immunity to M.tb challenge in hCD1Tg mice and NHP. We will also study
whether lipid antigen-specific T cells confer protective immunity using adoptive transfer experiments in hCD1Tg
mice. By the end of the funding period, we will have validated a set of tools that will be available to the broader
TB research community and addressed whether lipid-specific T cells should be considered a correlate of
protective immunity in Phase II/III clinical efficacy studies of whole cell mycobacterial vaccines."
10843906,"ASD is a common childhood disorder, which occurs in approximately 3.4 out of every 1,000 children, and requires a lifetime of care that leads to a significant burden for both families and state agencies. Core features of ASD include deficits in socialization, communication and behavior, and can present with other comorbidities such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, anxiety, depression, attention deficits and sleep disorders. The majority of ASD cases are complex and classified as sporadic, having a multitude of factors that combine to produce a disease phenotype; however, approximately 20% of ASD cases are syndromic with a well-established genetic cause. Despite the genetic heterogeneity between different types of syndromic ASD, these disorders display an incredible amount of phenotypic overlap. This overlap may indicate that the causal mutations across disorders, funnel through common molecular pathways during neuronal development, and thus indicate the potential for generalizable treatments. Currently, pharmacotherapies are severely lacking, as no effective pharmacological agents currently exist to treat core ASD symptoms. Therefore, further research into the neurobiology and underlying pathophysiology of ASD is required. In our grant, we propose to model ASD by developing cell and animal models in which the ASD risk gene
transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is mutated. TCF4 is associated with a rare neurodevelopmental model called Pitt
Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) that displays autism features. We hope by modeling this disorder we can identify
cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with risk for ASD that will eventually lead to the discovery of
therapeutic interventions.
 In Aim 1, we demonstrate that Tcf4 regulates the development of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and mutations in
Tcf4 result in hypomyelination. Our preliminary data from a mutant Tcf4 mouse model suggests that Tcf4
regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature OLs and this leads to a
significant decrease in myelination. We propose experiments to identify cellular and molecular mechanism for
how Tcf4 regulates OPC differentiation. In Aim 2, we propose experiments to connect Tcf4-dependent
hypomyelination to physiological and behavioral deficits by specifically manipulating Tcf4 expression only in
the OL-lineage. Moreover, we propose to rescue physiological and behavioral deficits by postnatally reinstating
Tcf4 expression only in the OL-lineage to determine if this target rescue of myelination can lead to
normalization of physiological and behavioral deficits. In Aim 3, we propose to use PTHS patient-derived
induce pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) to determine if OPC differentiation phenotypes observed in our mouse
models translate into human models of disease. Together, these Aims are designed to identify therapeutic
targets for the treatment of PTHS and potentially other ASDs."

11127935,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2015, President Obama announced his intention to
launch the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). The goal of the PMI Cohort Program is to enroll one million
volunteers into a national cohort that broadly reflects the diversity of the U.S. population and accelerate
progress toward a new era of precision medicine on a larger scale than previously possible. The objective of
this proposal is to utilize the full resources available through the Mayo Clinic Biorepositories Program and
Mayo Medical Laboratories to efficiently and cost effectively support the activities of the PMI Cohort Program
with respect to the Biobank, namely, biospecimen collection, kit assembly, biospecimen accessioning, tracking,
processing, quality assurance, storage, and distribution. Mayo Medical Laboratories, the third largest reference
laboratory in the United States, will enable efficient specimen transportation, routing, and information
management between PMI collection sites and the Mayo Clinic Biobank. The aims of this proposal are to: (1)
To provide collection kits and leverage existing sample shipment logistics to ensure specimens arrive at Mayo
Clinic Rochester in the most expedient, efficient, and safe manner possible, in accordance with all federal and
state regulations; (2) Scale up existing state-of-the-art laboratory automation and robotics to process, label,
and store biospecimens, using established protocols compliant with laboratory best practices for all steps of
specimen handling; (3) Use our high-quality, robust, and secure research laboratory information management
system (RLIMS) for detailed tracking of sample receipt, processing, storage, retrieval, and distribution, while
protecting participant confidentiality; (4) Apply our comprehensive Quality Management Program to ensure all
work carried out is of the highest quality, and safeguard the collection with robust back-up systems and plans
for disaster recovery; and (5) Work closely with the Coordinating Center, Collection Sites, and all other PMI
Cohort Program Steering Committee Members to share biobanking expertise, infrastructure, and data to
further the goals of the PMI. Overall, the Mayo Clinic Biorepositories Program laboratories combined with
Mayo Medical Laboratories provide an unparalleled ability to collect, accession, process, distribute, store, and
manage virtually any type of biospecimen on behalf of the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program."

Cisgender Black women in the United States (US) shoulder a significant burden of HIV and sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), with persistent disparities driven by stigma, implicit bias, and structural barriers. The
disproportionate impact of HIV/STIs among Black women in the US underscores a stark race disparity that
requires urgent action to address social and structural determinants of health (SSDHs). Maryland, a priority state
for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, has struggled to mitigate these disparities despite significant
prevention efforts. HIV prevention efforts in the United States have often been siloed and focused on individual
behavior modification, leaving significant gaps in addressing the complex interplay between individual, structural,
and social determinants of health that contribute to the disproportionate burden of HIV and STIs among Black
women. This R36 dissertation proposal seeks to bridge this gap by conducting a convergent mixed-methods
study to gain a comprehensive understanding of how existing SRH services can be adapted or expanded to
better address the prevention needs of Black women at risk for HIV in Maryland. By examining the current
availability, accessibility, and acceptability of SRH services for this population, this study aims to identify gaps in
service provision and explore the personal experiences and perspectives of Black women who have accessed
or attempted to access SRH services. The findings from this research will inform the development of evidence-
based recommendations for adapting or expanding existing SRH services to integrate HIV testing and prevention
strategies into broader SRH services, for an improved prevention approach that appeals to vulnerable
populations and accounts for social, structural, interpersonal, and individual factors. This study aligns with EHE
efforts and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Division of AIDS Research (DAR) priorities, as it aims
to inform the development targeted interventions for Black women at risk for HIV in Maryland. By employing a
scientifically rigorous, theory-based approach, the findings will contribute to the development of interventions
that contribute to both proximal and long-term distal outcomes for HIV prevention."
10838179,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects >300 million people chronically and is the leading cause of end-stage liver
disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), resulting in ~1 million deaths annually. HIV is a common co-
infection in people with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and worsens HBV and liver disease outcomes. Liver disease
is a leading cause of death among PWH in the era of antiretrovirals, mostly due to viral hepatitis. Antiviral
treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) suppresses plasma HBV DNA but does not eliminate the
covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) HBV template that resides in every infected cell. NUC interruption
leads to HBV DNA rebound and clinical hepatitis. Therefore, finding an HBV cure is of major importance for
HBV mono- and HIV/HBV co-infection.
Previously, we applied single-cell methods to HBV/HIV co-infected liver tissues and demonstrated that cccDNA
is transcriptionally suppressed during NUCs, although the phenomenon is likely to be reversible. We now
propose to uncover the mechanism underlying cccDNA transcriptional silencing since irreversible
transcriptional silencing can lead to a functional cure. We propose an intensive study of NUC-associated
cccDNA transcriptional suppression comparing people with HBV/HIV co- and HBV mono-infection. In aim one,
we will quantify intrahepatic viral DNA and RNA quantities in hepatocytes from HBV mono- and HBV/HIV co-
infected individuals during NUCs using single-cell laser capture microdissection and droplet digital PCR
(scLCM/ddPCR) to quantify a cccDNA transcriptional index (cccDNA TI). We will compare the cccDNA TI
between HBV mono- and HBV/HIV co-infection. In aim two we will characterize host genes that are
differentially expressed with regards to HBV RNAs and compare these between HBV mono- and HBV/HIV co-
infection. We will apply the 10X Visium spatial gene expression analysis (10x VSGEA) platform to liver tissues
with high vs. low cccDNA TI, interrogating HBV transcription using the same platform. Genes of interest (GOI)
identified by 10X VSGEA will be confirmed after enriching for cells with high vs. low cccDNA TI using
scLCM/ddPCR. We will prove GOI are involved in regulating HBV transcription in vitro studies using
CRISPR/cas9 knockout in HBV-infected NTCP-expressing HepG2 and primary human hepatocytes. We will
perform co-immunoprecipitation of GOI with HBV proteins to confirm mechanisms. In aim three we will
characterize epigenetic modifications of cccDNA in liver tissues already characterized with high vs low cccDNA
TI, comparing findings in HBV mono- and HBV/HIV co-infection. We will quantify CpG methylation, histone
modifications, and open chomatin in persons with high vs low cccDNA TI. In vitro, we will test the actions of
methyltransferases, histone acetyl transferases, and histone deacetylase inhibitors on cccDNA transcription
using an infection model of HBV. Our proposal fills knowledge gaps in understanding how to transform
reversible cccDNA transcriptional suppression to a functional cure."

DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s occur upon exposure of cells to ionizing radiation and chemicals in the
environment, and when DNA replication forks become impeded by lesions and obstacles then
subsequently collapse. Two mechanistically distinct DSB repair pathways, namely, homology-directed
repair (HDR) and non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ), are responsible for the removal of the majority
of DSBs. Whereas HDR is mostly accurate, NHEJ, while efficient, often entails loss of DNA sequence
during repair, and can also generate chromosome translocations and replication fork fusions. Failure of
NHEJ or HDR leads to heightened engagement of alternate end-joining (AltEJ) and single-strand annealing
(SSA), highly mutagenic and otherwise minor pathways, as repair tools. As such, the choice of DSB repair
pathway has a major impact on the maintenance of genome stability, preventing neoplastic transformation
of cells, and oncogenesis. Our Program Project brings together seven leading NIH-funded laboratories to
collaborate synergistically in delineating conserved mechanisms of HDR, replication fork repair, and
replication fork maintenance, and how HDR is negatively regulated to favor the use of NHEJ as DSB repair
tool. We have assembled three Shared Resource Cores to provide state-of-the-art services in the
production of high quality protein preparations for mechanistic experiments, biophysical and structural
analyses of protein-ligand interactions and precise measurement of binding constants, as well as cellular
interrogations of mechanisms of DSB repair and replication fork maintenance. Altogether, we are
exceptionally well poised to leverage our deep knowledge of DSB repair mechanisms and leadership to
understand how the tumor suppressors BRCA1-BARD1 and BRCA2 function to promote HDR and to
overcome the HDR restrictive action of the epigenetic mark reader 53BP1 and its associated Shieldin and
CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complexes. As such, our Program Project will not only exert a major impact in
elucidating mechanisms of DSB repair pathway choice and cancer drug resistance, but will also identify
novel targets and pathway pivot points to guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat
incalcitrant breast, ovarian and other cancers."

The Training Program in the Environmental Health Sciences and Toxicology has as its vision to assure that
trainees gain the skills they need to develop as successful independent, transdisciplinary, ethically engaged
environmental health researchers and practitioners in a program informed by and aligned with the NIEHS
mission - to learn how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives and to conduct and
translate research that meets individual and community needs. This renewal builds on the 20 years of success
in training environmental health scientists, a commitment to innovation to meet the evolving needs of
environmental health and toxicology, and a robust and broad portfolio of environmental health sciences
research led by 41 training faculty and supported by nearly 140 research projects and grants, a NIEHS P30
Core Center, a NIEHS Children’s Translational Research Center, as well as collaboration with numerous other
centers and programs throughout the University. Predoctoral trainees take rigorous coursework in their first two
years to gain a comprehensive base of knowledge aligned around four Core Training Elements: (1) exposure
science, (2) biological mechanisms of susceptibility and disease, and (3) environmental determinants of
population health, and (4) environmental justice. For both pre- and postdoctoral trainees, mentored research
sits at the center of this training program, allowing trainees to gain an in-depth understanding of a specific topic
through their chosen mentor and project, aligned with the Core Training Elements, and trainees have
developed projects in molecular and neurotoxicology, environmental epidemiology, exposure science,
environmental determinants of infectious and chronic disease, genomics, and metabolomics. This is
supplemented by training in the responsible conduct of research and ethics, rigor and reproducibility of
research, communication and grant-writing skills, teaching, and numerous opportunities for professional
development and management training. We propose to continue the support of six predoctoral and three
postdoctoral trainees. Predoctoral trainees hold bachelor’s and often master’s degrees in basic science, public
health, or engineering disciplines, and postdoctoral trainees must hold a doctoral degree in environmental
health, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental engineering, or related basic or public health science
disciplines. All trainees must demonstrate a commitment to research and a career in the environmental health
sciences and/or toxicology. Our program has had success in recruiting and retaining individuals historically
under-represented in science, and we have numerous programs in place to continue and increase these
opportunities. Trainees completing this program are entering research intensive positions academic,
government, non-profit, and for-profit sectors. We aim to continue the tradition of excellence in providing
trainees a multidisciplinary training experience to successfully pursue complex problems in the environmental
health sciences and toxicology and make an impact on community health."
10847990,"PROJECT 3: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project focus in the biology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in older individuals (i.e., patients 75
years or older). Based on findings in national cohorts from our group and others, DLBCL in older patients is
associated with comparatively worse outcomes even when accounting for treatment intensity and lymphoma
subtype. Our preliminary data suggest that intrinsic biological differences in DLBCL in older patients may account
for their poor response to chemoimmunotherapy. For example, we found that DLBCL in older patients associates
with higher proportion of activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCLs and higher number of inflammatory cells in the
lymphoma microenvironment. The reasons for these differences are not yet fully elucidated. Since aging, even
healthy aging, is associated with epigenetic alterations across tissues and epigenetics influences the physiology
and pathology of B cells, we hypothesize that some of the biological differences in DLBCL in older patients is
driven by epigenetic alterations of aging (EAA). In this project, we will determine whether EAA in B cells
predispose them to lymphomagenesis driven by MYD88 mutations, a frequent event in ABC-DLBCLs. Other
projects in this P01 are exploring the mechanisms by which MYD88 and other immune synapse mutations
activating the BCR pathway, modify the epigenetic landscape of B cells to drive lymphomagenesis. Using “fertile
soil” concept, we proposed that EAAs make B cells prone to malignant transformation by immune synapse
mutations. Concomitantly, we propose that EAA affecting immune and stromal cells that populate the
microenvironment are prone to acquire inflammatory phenotypes that contribute to lymphoma progression. Other
projects in this P01 are exploring the epigenetic mechanisms that allow B cells in physiological and pathological
contexts to receive proliferation and survival signals from immune microenvironment cells. We plan to test our
central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this project by pursuing these specific aims to: (1) Elucidate
EAAs that reprogram GC B cells and enable the activity of ABC-DLBCL oncogenes; (2) Elucidate mechanisms
in the aging microenvironment that are permissive for lymphomagenesis; and (3) Develop therapeutic
approaches that target the aging phenotype. Thus, our project will provide the scientific rationale to design
biologically driven chemotherapy-free combinatorial treatments for older DLBCL patients. Overall, our project is
integral to the ideas explored in this P01 adding a biologically and clinically relevant perspective from the aging
standpoint, for what we anticipate will be an unprecedented understanding of the complex epigenetic
mechanisms that regulate the immune synapse in DLBCL patients."
10848846,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Exacerbating replication stress is a powerful means to kill cancer cells through mitotic catastrophe due to
intolerable levels of DNA replication-associated lesions and DNA breaks. Replication stress is a hallmark of
SCLC due to several intrinsic factors, including the loss of tumor suppressors p53 and RB1 in nearly 100% of
SCLC. As a consequence of replication stress, constitutive activation of the replication stress response (RSR)
pathway(s) is a critical measure to counterbalance cancer cell survival and genomic instability in SCLC. In
dealing with high levels of endogenous and/or exogenous replication stress, we hypothesize that SCLC cells
have acquired an intricate genome-wide protective mechanism to counteract high levels of replication stress.
However, the molecular details and signaling pathways that mediate replication stress tolerance in SCLC cells
remains ill-defined, especially in conditions leading to relapsed SCLC.
 In Project 2, we will address this knowledge gap with the following specific Aims: in Aim 1, we will characterize
the RSR pathway(s) that enable replication stress tolerance in SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will determine how RSR
pathways regulate chemo-resistance in SCLC models.
Defining the unique therapeutic vulnerabilities of these SCLC subtypes and how they can overcome
chemotherapy resistance should help to focus and accelerate therapeutics research, leading to rationally-
targeted approaches that may ultimately improve clinical outcomes for patients with this disease.
The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project with the other three Projects and the
three Cores. Our combined diverse approaches include molecular biology, functional genomics, and cell biology.
We will employ mutants of different RSR proteins and initiate experiments based on results shared with projects
1, 3, and 4, which will be constantly monitored with feedback via Core A. SCLC cell lines and PDX models will
be supported by Core B, and advanced imaging platform and computational analysis will be supported by Core
C."
10848847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will investigate the specific mechanisms of DNA lesions that are generated in SCLC during
treatment and lead to response or resistance to therapy. This is Project 3 (“Repair Mechanisms of Replication-
Fork Lesions”) which is part of a Program Project titled, “Investigating and Targeting Replication Stress in
Small Cell Lung Cancer”. Despite the major clinical importance of replication stress related lesions and their
repair processes to therapy response, we know surprisingly little about their molecular mechanism and how
defects in these processes confer specific vulnerabilities and resistance in tumors.
 This project aims to fill several fundamental gaps in our knowledge of replication-fork lesions and their
mechanisms of repair, and explore novel hypotheses by employing an array of innovative cellular, and single-
molecule techniques and assays to define the key steps and molecular mechanisms of DNA lesion formation
and repair in SCLC. First, we will define the specific subtypes of replication-fork lesions in naïve SCLC with
known genetic backgrounds and establish their signaling and repair processes, and their contribution to cellular
state and overall response. Next, we will determine how these processes are affected upon emergence of
therapeutic resistance, and the effects of new targeted therapies in resistant SCLC subtypes.
 In Aim 1 “Define specific fork-lesions and their repair processes in naïve SCLC” we will establish the
specific sub-types of DNA lesions in SCLC, and their DDR/R processes, and the formation of specific lesions
at unique genomic and chromosomal sites, transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), G4 DNA structures etc,
and their effect on cell state and therapeutic response.
 In Aim 2, “Establish how formation and repair of fork-lesions is altered in resistant SCLC subtypes”, we will
measure the specific modes of resistance in terms of particular lesion formation, suppression and repair, and
their contribution to cellular sensitization to immunotherapy.
 The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project with the other three Projects
and the three Cores. Our combined diverse approaches include molecular biology, cell biology and engineered
cell lines, tumor models, sequencing and scRNA-seq, proteomics and advanced microscopy approaches. Cell
lines, targets, molecular player, treatments, and experiments will be designed with Projects 1, 2, and 4, and will
be constantly monitored with feedback via Core A. Cellular models will be constructed and validated by Core
B, and imaging and analysis will be supported by Core C."

QUANITATIVE OMICS (QOC) CORE: The field of precision medicine offers the promise of improving the health
of patients through targeted treatments and therapeutics based on the unique characteristics of the individual.
Due to its nature, precision medicine studies frequently require custom solutions and novel
statistical/bioinformatics methods. For the same reason, they require cross-disciplinary data scientists with a
“team-science” background to facilitate both a comprehensive understanding of the needs of domain experts
and the requisite technical expertise to support those needs by applying state-of-the-art data science methods
and, when necessary, develop custom solutions. The Quantitative ‘OmiCs (QOC) Core has been formulated to
address these needs by providing high-quality data science support to the Kansas Institute of Precision Medicine
(KIPM). In this Phase 2 application, the QOC Core will seek to expand its expertise to include artificial
intelligence, deep-learning, analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data, and molecular modeling guided by the
new RPLs associated with this application. In addition, the QOC Core will collaborate with other institutional
cores to pool resources, expanding its repertoire of research supporting tools and technologies and enhance its
computing infrastructure. This serves both the data science needs of the RPLs and contributes to the long-term
sustainability of the QOC Core by broadening the scope and quality of its services. Finally, this Core will seek to
recruit users beyond the KIPM to assure its long-term operation."
10848670,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
The overall goal of the Population Sciences (PS) Program is to reduce and prevent morbidity and mortality
associated with cancer and its treatment, particularly among those in our catchment area, and to improve
patients' quality of life. Our aims span the cancer continuum from primary prevention to epidemiological research
on cancer risk relationships, and factors that influence cancer treatment outcomes which can be intervened upon
to improve survivorship. Reducing cancer health disparities is a common cross-cutting element to each aim. Our
aims are aligned with the Center's mission to eliminate cancer's grip on humanity through cancer research,
cancer treatment, cancer prevention and cancer education.
To address these goals, our research is driven by three specific aims: 1) to prevent cancer by intervening on
modifiable risk factors, especially the burden of tobacco-related cancers, at the individual, regional, national, and
global levels; 2) to understand cancer risk relationships, particularly at the molecular level and in
underrepresented populations; and 3) to investigate factors that influence cancer treatment outcomes and
survivorship for insights into interventions to improve survival and enhance quality of life in our patients.
The PS program continues to be co-led by Drs. Christine Ambrosone, and Andrew Hyland, who have
complementary expertise that bridge these aims. Cutting-edge science includes studies in each of our aims that
are policy impactful, practice changing, and paradigm shifting.
Population Sciences members actively collaborate within and across the CCSG programs. We work closely with
the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) Office and the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
in all facets of the research process, including shaping the research direction of the program based on feedback
from the Community Advisory Board, working together for study recruitment through the `ROCKstars' program,
collecting surveillance and evaluation data in the community for needs assessments and tracking outcomes, and
sharing research results with the community. Our members are actively engaged in Cancer Research Training
and Education Coordination (CRTEC), providing training experiences for trainees at all levels, and participating
in faculty training and career development programs provided by the CRTEC and DEI teams.
The 38 members of the PS Program have $13.9M in peer-reviewed funding in 2023 (>3-fold increase from $3.8M
in 2018) including $11.1M from NCI (also >3-fold increase from $3.0M in 2018), 15 large teams science grants,
and 37 R01-type grants. Of the 965 publications since 2018, 22% were published in high-impact journals, 34%
inter-programmatic, 33% intra-programmatic, and 53% collaborative with investigators at other institutions. In the
coming cycle, PS members will continue to build upon their strengths and to expand into areas where there are
current gaps with a goal to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality, particularly in our catchment area."
10849366,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite recent advances in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), five-year overall
survival (OS) has remained poor due to high rates of disease progression after treatment. A lack of reliable
prognostic biomarkers limits our ability to predict disease progression in non-human papillomavirus (HPV)
mediated HNSCC. Even among candidates for salvage surgery in the setting of disease progression after
primary chemoradiotherapy (CRT), 5-year OS is estimated at just 16%. Radiomics, which involves the analysis
of large numbers of quantitative tumor imaging features, has been recently used to develop image-based
prognostic models. More specifically, delta radiomics incorporates differences between pre- and post-treatment
images, thereby capturing quantitative measures of treatment response. To address the critical need for
prognostic biomarkers for patients with HNSCC, we aim to develop and validate radiogenomics models to predict
2-year overall and progression-free survival using gene expression, ctDNA and delta radiomic data. Prior studies
have developed highly accurate models of cancer treatment response using delta radiomics, but not in patients
with locoregionally advanced HNSCC. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated reliable and concordant
genomic and radiomic prognostic phenotypes in HNSCC. In this study, we hypothesize that a radiogenomics
model will accurately predict 2-year overall and progression-free survival. To advance the overall objective of
this study, we will pursue the following two Specific Aims. Our first aim is to 1) develop a fully annotated, patient-
centered, clinical outcome and radiographic dataset with associated biospecimen samples for patients with
locoregionally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC treated with definitive CRT. Our second aim is to use liquid
based-biopsy biomarkers, gene expression data, and delta radiomic features derived from pre- and post-
treatment imaging to predict 2-year OS and PFS in patients with locoregionally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC
treated with definitive CRT. We will extract delta radiomics features and measure transcription of ~1,800 genes
in the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas using digital spatial profiling, focusing on genes relevant to epidermal growth
factor receptor, MAPK-associated protein kinase 2 (MK2) and hypoxia pathways. We will then measure
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using banked pre- and post-treatment plasma samples. This will enable us to
explore radiogenomics phenotypes associated with 2-year OS and PFS in patients with HNSCC treated with
CRT. The long-term goal of this work is to support future clinical trials aimed at early identification of patients at
high-risk of disease progression who are likely to benefit from intensified, precision treatment approaches."

applications. Our work is grounded in the understanding of harnessing the immune system to prevent and treat
patients with all types of cancer, aligning with the Institutional mission to pioneer innovative therapies through
immuno-oncology (IO) research. TII has a rich history of translating its research discoveries into patient care,
supported by strong collaborations within and across Institutes and working closely with our Community
Outreach and Engagement (COE) team. We are committed to focusing on cancers with high incidence rates in
our catchment area, ensuring that our research targets the most pressing health concerns and the diverse patient
population of the communities we serve. These basic, translational, and clinical initiatives will continue to expand
due to multiple ongoing major team science grants and new faculty specializing in active and cellular
immunotherapies. To achieve these objectives, TII's research is driven by three core Specific Aims: 1) identifying
key mechanisms driving the host antitumor immune response; 2) understanding therapeutic resistance barriers
to effective antitumor immunity; and 3) developing and testing novel immunotherapy strategies for both solid and
hematologic malignancies. Drs. Scott Abrams and Emese Zsiros co-lead the TII program, each bringing their
unique strengths. Dr. Abrams' leadership focuses on the basic and preclinical components of the Program,
which unites closely with Dr. Zsiros' leadership, which focuses on the translational and clinical research
initiatives. Our program includes 30 members from 11 Departments, with annual peer-reviewed direct funding of
$13.5M, $10.9M of which is from the NCI. TII faculty actively participates in several major team science grants,
including the renewal of the Roswell Park-University of Chicago Ovarian Cancer SPORE. Altogether, TII faculty
serves as PD/PI on four (i.e., P50, P01, U01, and DoD Breakthrough Level 4), MPI on three (i.e., 2 additional
U01's and 1 U24), and Project Leader on two (i.e., a second P50 and a second P01) major team science awards.
Of 756 publications to date, 34% are high impact (IF>10), with 50% and 57% involving inter-program or inter-
institute collaborations, respectively. TII maintains a robust clinical trial portfolio with >1,000 interventional
treatment accruals during this funding period. TII faculty also lead or co-lead multiple training grants and actively
partners with the Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination core aiming to mentor the next
generation of IO scientists. We stand committed to fostering a diverse academic environment by recruiting an
array of faculty, with a special emphasis on underrepresented minorities, to enrich our perspectives and enhance
our collective expertise. With a strong funding base, the expertise of our faculty, and robust collaborations, TII is
well-positioned to continue advancing IO-based discoveries and developing innovative therapeutics."

Women at risk for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are in dire need of new approaches to detect early disease
and novel studies are essential to advance our knowledge of how the EOC tumor microenvironment contributes
to cancer initiation. Innovative approaches in microbial profiling can facilitate breakthroughs in the
discovery of key molecular pathways that contribute to EOC and drive the development of novel liquid biopsy
microbial-based quantitative assays for screening women in clinical practice settings. In preliminary studies, we
have identified patterns and changes in known gut bacteria from plasma and fecal samples that may be related
to ovarian malignancy. The detection of EOC-associated plasma bacteria would be highly favorable for screening
particularly in the deadliest EOC histologic subtype, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. The overall objective
of this proposal is to validate plasma bacteria in women with EOC and investigate the source. Our central
hypothesis is bacteria found in the plasma of women with EOC originates from the ovarian tumor site. The
rationale for this proposal is to determine if bacteria in the plasma can provide a means of early disease detection.
To attain the overall objective, we will pursue the following two Specific Aims. Our first aim is to identify and
validate candidate bacterial species as robust biomarkers to differentiate ovarian cancer cases from benign
disease and other solid tumors. Our second aim is to evaluate plasma and intratumor bacteria for concordance
in women with EOC. To achieve Aim 1, we will isolate nucleic acids from the plasma samples of women with
EOC, non-EOC solid tumors, benign gynecologic conditions, and healthy controls and apply 16S rRNA gene
sequencing to assess for differences in bacterial diversity and abundance; verify absolute abundance of the
EOC-associated bacteria with quantitative PCR; and assess the informative bacteria biomarkers for sensitivity
in plasma using samples from asymptomatic women before and after a clinical diagnosis of EOC. To achieve
Aim 2, based on our prior preliminary data and newly discovered pathobionts that have high association with
EOC, we will enrich plasma bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), as a paracrine conduit to intra-tumoral
bacteria and measure their abundance through the copy number of their respective 16S rRNA signature using
droplet digital PCR and correlate with bacterial 16S rRNA gene levels in tumor samples. Subtle pathological
changes are shown to facilitate paracellular transport of BEVs released from bacterial cells, and therefore, BEVs
can be used to correlate EOC grade, stage, and/or histology of the tumor. The application of reproducible BEV
microbial markers unique to early ovarian cancer would be vastly innovative to this field. This study proposal
contributes to a dynamic change in thinking from the traditional notion of “infectious diseases” as the potential
drivers of ovarian carcinogenesis to the mindset that noninfectious migratory gut bacteria could be pivotal to
disease. Thus, this exciting proposal will elucidate bacteria and BEVs (as clinical markers) that are exclusive to
EOC tumors specifically for the early detection of ovarian cancer."

Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center has served Western New York (WNY) for 125 years with a unifying
mission to understand, prevent, and cure cancer. A central component of this mission is to meet the needs of
Roswell Park's catchment area population with a specific focus on strategies to promote health equity. For more
than three decades, Roswell Park has defined our catchment area as the eight counties surrounding the main
medical campus in Buffalo, NY, and this region includes geographically diverse areas such as urban, rural, and
Appalachian regions. Our COE is led by Elizabeth Bouchard, PhD, Associate Director and Senior Vice President
for Community Outreach and Engagement. At Roswell Park, we have a rich tradition of community-engaged
research that has been fostered through strong support from our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG)
leadership. Over the last five years, our Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) CCSG component has
expanded effective partnerships, processes, and strategies to ensure that WNY communities are the central
focus of our CCSG mission. We achieve this through two broad visions that drive our CCSG. First, the needs of
our community motivate what we focus on. Second, the context and perspectives of communities in our
catchment area drive how we conduct research. Our COE program has driven a unified, community-partnered
strategic planning process to ensure that the needs and priorities of communities in our catchment area are
catalyzing high-impact science. Community-driven priorities for cancer research and cancer control are: lung
cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, tobacco use, physical activity and nutrition, and the
social determinants of health. Our specific aims are designed to achieve these broad visions. Aim 1: To
implement data-driven and community-engaged processes to understand significant cancer burden and related
disparities relevant to the catchment area and rigorously monitor impact. Aim 2: To facilitate research and clinical
trial participation across Roswell Park relevant to the significant cancer burden in WNY. Aim 3. To implement
evidence-based interventions, disseminate educational materials and resources, and advance policy to reduce
the cancer burden and related disparities in the Roswell Park catchment area and beyond. Our COE has built
robust internal and external infrastructure, and we are now observing the beneficial impacts of these long-
standing initiatives through increased community-academic research partnerships and improvements in
important cancer-relevant metrics in WNY. We have worked with our Community Advisory Board and community
partners to identify the following areas for future growth: (1) enhance navigation and support across the cancer
continuum; and (2) increase focus on the social determinants of cancer risk and outcomes. Our long-term goal

10848673,"Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center Director, Candace Johnson (DT) is responsible for oversight and
allocation of all Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds. This budget line is critical to
supporting strategically aligned pilot projects and faculty recruitment. As a stand-alone cancer center, Dr.
Johnson can leverage philanthropic funds raised by the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation (RPAF) to ensure
the success of CCSG Developmental Fund investments. In the current project period (2018-2023), RPAF
allocated $62.6M to support high priority scientific projects.
During the current project period, CCSG Developmental Funds supported 13 CCSG faculty ($1,225,000);
invested in shared resources to develop new assays and techniques and to enhance new utilization of these
services by CCSG members ($699,326); and 24 pilot projects were funded ($910,546). Intra- and inter-
programmatic projects were initiated with the ultimate goal of team grant submissions within 2 years. The return
on investment, measured by publications and grants awarded, is monitored by CCSG Administration, with
reports shared with Senior Leadership bi-annually. Roswell Park faculty consistently reported excellent returns
on investment.
CCSG Developmental Funds and RPAF Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) funds are administered through
standardized processes wherein CCSG Administration provides back-end infrastructure using InfoReady
software. Program and Senior Leaders assist in decision making by serving on the internal peer-review
committees that select the most meritorious high-impact, high-risk projects for pilot project funding. Dr. Johnson
ultimately manages the allocation process and ensures requests are in line with the strategic plan and cancer
center priorities.
The flexibility to fund innovative pilot projects is critical to CCSG faculty taking risks with their breakthrough
discoveries. During the next grant period, CCSG Developmental Funds will support the following recruitment and
pilot grant initiatives:
  Recruitments: The Cancer Center will recruit two key investigators per year; $300,000 per year will be
 used to support new investigators in each of the CCSG programs over the project period.
  Pilot Grants: Grants will be awarded to individual investigators through the CCSG Developmental Funds/
 RPAF SAC process, with allocations to each research program, and for Team Science. Projects aligned
 with the strategic plan will be prioritized within the anticipated allocation of up to $300,000 per year."
11002760,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed study is a five-year career development research plan that focuses on dissecting the epigenetic
regulation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and regeneration in mouse models of optic nerve crush
and glaucoma. The candidate is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at
Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The candidate intends to further extend his expertise
in epigenomic profiling technologies, mechanisms of optic neuropathies and development of neural regenerative
therapeutics by integrating the mentor team of Dr. Zhigang He at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical
School, Dr. Joshua Sanes at Harvard University and Harvard Brain Science Initiative, Dr. Jeffery Goldberg at
Stanford University and Byers Eye Institute, and Dr. Jason Buenrostro at Harvard Stem Cell and Regenerative
Biology (SCRB) Department and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The candidate has also recruited Dr. Daniel
Geschwind, a collaborator of his current and proposed studies, as his advisor for specific scientific and technical
support. The proposed experiments and training activities will enable the candidate to publish top-tier
ophthalmology research works and uniquely position him as an independent principal investigator pursuing novel
therapeutics for retinal disease such as glaucoma.
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States with at least 3,000,000 people affected.
This number is likely to increase by 60% by 2030 if no new therapeutics could be developped. Due to the inablity
of central nervous system to regenerate after injury, the vision loss resulted from RGC death is irreversible and
will lead to permanent blindness. Our preliminary experiments using the CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo forward
genetic screen have discovered that the knockdown of injury induced epigenetic regulators, such as CCCTC-
binding factor (CTCF), can robustly promote RGC axonal regeneration or/and survival. To explore the underlying
epigenetic mechanisms regulating RGC survival and regeneration, the proposed study will specifically pursue
the following aims: (1) To profile injury-induced chromatin remodeling in RGCs by ATAC sequencing (mentored
phase); (2) To assess the mechanisms that mediate differential effects of survival and regeneration regulators
upon injury (mentored and independent phase); and (3) To assess the mechanisms and effects of epigenetic
regulators in a glaucoma model (independent phase). For the past two years during this K99 award, I have
successfully accomplished all experiments and goals in Aim 1 and Aim2, with two manuscripts published on
Neuron in 2022 (and selected as cover story). For the extended period of my K award, I will further pursue the
translational study of my approaches in glaucoma relevant mouse models. The outcome of the proposed study
will provide in-depth and quantitative insights into why and how the regenerative fates of RGCs are pre-
determined from an epigenomic perspective, which can be directly transformed to new cures for optic
neuropathies."

Background: Obesity and diabetes are important risk factors for morbidity and mortality in people with HIV
(PWH), especially in sub-Saharan Africa where health systems are already grappling with a rapid rise in
metabolic disease. Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has recently been adopted as the
first-line regimen in most of the region, despite evidence that it is associated with excess weight gain. While the
HIV care system offers a capable health systems platform, obesity and diabetes prevention is not a current
focus of care paradigms. Candidate: I am a Clinical Fellow in Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General
Hospital and a physician-scientist with doctoral-level training in global health epidemiology and a strong track
record of published observational research. However, my recent experiences caring for PWH have led to a
desire to gain new skills in the design and execution of interventional trials to prevent metabolic disease in this
population. My overarching career goal is to become an independent, NIH-funded physician-scientist with
expertise in the metabolic complications of treated HIV, and in developing and testing clinical interventions to
prevent these complications. Training: To achieve research independence, I will require additional training in
1) obesity medicine and diabetes prevention, 2) behavioral model-based intervention design, and 3) the
conduct and analysis of clinical trials to prevent metabolic complications of HIV. Mentors: My training and
research plans will be overseen by my primary mentor Dr. Mark Siedner, who has extensive mentoring
experience and conducts both observational cohort studies and clinical trials in South Africa. Drs. Janet Lo
(obesity medicine and diabetes prevention), Christina Psaros (behavioral model-based intervention design),
and Deborah Wexler (the conduct and analysis of clinical trials) will serve as co-mentors to provide additional
focused expertise. I will also receive annual feedback from my Scientific Advisory Board, which includes Drs.
Rochelle Walensky, Naomi Levitt, Robert Parker, and Till Bärnighausen. Research: With guidance from my
team of mentors, I will explore the metabolic effects of DTG among PWH in South Africa and develop and pilot
an intervention to mitigate these complications through three specific aims: 1) To determine the behavioral
correlates of weight change and glucose intolerance for PWH transitioning to DTG-based ART in South Africa;
2) To develop an acceptable and contextually appropriate intervention to prevent weight gain and diabetes in
PWH on DTG-based ART in South Africa; and 3) To conduct a factorial-randomized feasibility study of
interventions to prevent weight gain and diabetes among PWH on DTG-based ART versus usual care. We will
carry out this research through existing collaborations with the Wellcome Trust-funded Africa Health Research
Institute (AHRI). Through this period of training and research, I will be well positioned to achieve research
independence and plan to submit an NIH R01 application in the fourth year of this project to test the efficacy of
an intervention to prevent weight gain and diabetes in PWH in South Africa."
10857254,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are a key tool in reducing harms of the opioid epidemic. Yet only
a minority of those with OUD initiate treatment, early discontinuation is typical, and disparities are endemic.
People with disabilities are at especially high risk and epitomize the challenges of OUD with multimorbidity.
Preliminary analyses identified 45,035 fatal opioid overdoses among Medicare disability beneficiaries (MDBs)
from 2008-2016, and continuing under-utilization and disparities in MOUD, including among overdose
survivors. With its wide influence in the health care system, Medicare's role is vital; it is essential to examine
the Medicare system's successes and failures in engaging and retaining MDBs in treatment. Several recent
policy changes are promising, with important implications for other payers, but their impact across beneficiary
subgroups, time and communities needs to be better understood to inform action to improve uptake and
reduce disparities. This study, responding to RFA-DA-22-037, will use national Medicare data linked with the
National Death Index, Medicaid claims, community resources, prescription drug plan (PDP) formulary policies,
and other data sources to assess how policy, community, provider and patient factors interact to shape MOUD
initiation and retention, and in turn overdose and other clinical outcomes. With annual updates through 2025,
the project will provide a powerful framework for assessing evolving treatment patterns and outcomes in a
rapidly evolving environment, as well as potential changes in policy impacts over time. We will assess the
drivers of racial/ethnic and other disparities in access; MOUD changes following policy and formulary changes
by Medicare and its PDPs; and how these policies interact with the evolving MOUD provider system,
community resources and patient characteristics. We will analyze trends and disparities in MOUD treatment
and overdoses among MDBs. In cohorts of beneficiaries with new OUD diagnoses or non-fatal overdoses, we
will assess factors associated with treatment initiation and retention, and association of treatment with clinical
outcomes including non-fatal and fatal overdose. We will assess MOUD uptake across community, provider,
and patient subgroups; changes in MOUD treatment patterns associated with the shift to tele-health; and
associated changes in the MOUD treatment network serving MDBs. We will examine the sequelae of changes
in formulary policies across Medicare's more than 6000 PDPs, including prior authorization requirements for
MOUD, across beneficiary subgroups. Expanded reimbursement for tele-MOUD and elimination of prior
authorization have the potential to save many lives, but it is critical to better understand their impact on access
and disparities. An active dissemination strategy supported by a Stakeholder Advisory Board, complementing
peer-reviewed publication, will support translation into evidence-informed policy. Results of this innovative and
comprehensive assessment of the multi-level factors shaping MOUD uptake and outcomes among MDBs will
have important implications for policy and practice across patient subgroups, payers and health care systems."

This NIH Career Development Award proposal describes a five-year career development and training plan for
Dr. Margaret Flanagan, a physician-scientist in the Division of Neuropathology in the Department of Laboratory
Medicine and Pathology at the University of Minnesota. Her long-term goal is to become an independent,
physician-scientist leader who will make significant contributions in the field of dementia research. Her career
development training plan includes the following: protected research time, focused formal graduate coursework
targeted to advance her knowledge and skills in Epidemiology, a structured mentoring program with a
multidisciplinary team of experienced senior scientists, and focused research experience investigating the role
of neuroinflammation in Limbic predominant age-related TDP43 encephalopathy (LATE). This training plan
will culminate in a successful application for independent research funding by an investigator who is prepared
to take an active leadership role in transformative change leading to improved health care outcomes in
dementias associated with transactive response binding protein-43 (TDP43) associated inflammation, including
Alzheimer Disease (AD), hippocampal sclerosis of aging and frontotemporal dementia.
TDP43 is a highly conserved nuclear riboprotein that plays a role in a variety of cellular functions including
RNA processing. More recently, it has been shown that age-related increases in dementia risk are attributed to
the accumulation of multiple co-existing brain lesions, each of which contributes significantly to dementia risk.
Because there are no reliable biomarkers for TDP43 or α-synuclein, it is currently impossible to accurately
detect all co-existing lesions in vivo, limiting these comprehensive assessments to postmortem studies of the
brain.
The objective of this proposed research is to clarify the role of neuroinflammation in LATE clinical disease
progression. Dr. Flanagan will investigate TDP43 associated inflammatory markers relevant to pathways of
interest, co-existing neuropathologic lesions, LATE genetic risk variants and cognitive performance data in
well-characterized samples from Mayo Clinic. This work will inform on the role of TDP43-associated
neuroinflammation in the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in late life and ultimately, enable
the development of future preventative and therapeutic interventions. This research will provide some of the
first information about neuroinflammation in LATE.
In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research and
mentorship structure will allow Dr. Flanagan to become a successful, independent physician-scientist."
10861905,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Significance. One-third of patients with severe lung infection by influenza A virus (IAV) develop secondary
infection by inhaled Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Coinfection by IAV and SA causes about 30% mortality despite
therapy. It remains unclear how IAV promotes secondary SA infection, particularly in lung alveoli. This issue is
important because alveoli are the anatomical site of fatal SA-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI), but alveolar
defense mechanisms, including alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion, should prevent SA stabilization and
coinfection initiation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine alveolar responses to IAV that
promote secondary SA infection in alveoli, resulting in SA-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. The
hypothesis is IAV lung infection inhibits AWL secretion, a homeostatic mechanism by which alveoli clear inhaled
particles. The inhibition causes alveolar retention of SA and the secreted SA toxin, alpha hemolysin (Hla). The
retention enhances alveolar contact with SA and Hla, promoting SA stabilization against the alveolar wall and
Hla-induced alveolar fluid barrier loss, leading to alveolar edema and fatal ALI. In addition to directly supporting
the hypothesis, preliminary data indicate IAV lung infection caused: (A) dephosphorylation, hence inactivation of
the alveolar cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel, the critical protein for
AWL secretion; and (B) methylation of the CFTR-dephosphorylating protein, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), which may promote PP2Ac-CFTR interactions. Specific Aims are as follows. Aim 1
will define the role of CFTR in alveolar retention of inhaled SA. Aim 2 will define the role of PP2Ac methylation
in IAV-induced inhibition of AWL secretion. Since our preliminary data suggest CFTR and the PP2Ac-
methylating enzyme, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) may represent new therapeutic targets to
restore AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, Aim 3 will test the therapeutic potential of CFTR- and LCMT1-
targeted approaches to protect against coinfection-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. These Aims
will be achieved using our established methods, which include cell culture, mouse models of ALI, and real-time
confocal microscopy of live, intact mouse and human lungs. Determinations in IAV-infected mice will include
measures of: (1) alveolar retention of SA; (2) AWL secretion; (3) alveolar CFTR phosphorylation status;
(4) alveolar PP2Ac methylation status; (5) SA- and Hla- alveolar epithelial damage and alveolar barrier loss; and
(6) SA-induced pulmonary edema and mortality. We will use: (i) wild type mice treated with inhibitors of alveolar
PP2Ac-CFTR and PP2Ac-LCMT1 interactions, including drug inhibitors, plasmid DNA encoding mutant proteins,
and siRNA; and (ii) transgenic mice lacking alveolar epithelial CFTR and LCMT1 expression. This proposal is
expected to achieve new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which IAV disrupts critical alveolar function
leading to fatal ALI, and to establish restoration of AWL secretion – that is, “AWL rescue” – as a new therapeutic
approach for ALI caused by IAV-SA coinfection. Therefore, this proposal addresses the NHLBI mission."

The Clinical Coordination Core (CCC) provides oversight for efficient and optimal enrollment of patients with
early Lyme disease as manifested by erythema migrans (and/or other features of disseminated early Lyme
disease) and for an antibody-based prevalence study of patient populations at high risk of exposure to Ixodes
scapularis transmitted tickborne infections. The CCC provides the centerpiece for successful completion of the
Aims outlined in Projects 1-3. The CCC directs the collection of clinical information and blood and tissue
samples, supports the practice infrastructure for subject retention and follow-up and co-ordinates efficient
distribution of samples to the Diagnostics Core. We will develop and maintain an integrated system for data
management among the three medical institutions at MaineHealth, Tufts University School of Medicine, and
MassGeneral Brigham (MGB). The CCC supports, monitors and, if appropriate, modifies operations for our
outpatient –based network of front-line providers of care in high incidence areas for Lyme disease. Our
enrollment sites include hospital-based practices, independent primary care sites, and urgent care centers over
large geographic areas in New England. Our enrollment strategy incorporates an iterative approach to
successful practice site engagement that will maximize enrollment of subjects with early Lyme disease through
ongoing interaction with the capacity to augment support if needed. Contingencies for practice site expansion
are in place if needed. Detailed protocols for subject enrollment, skin biopsies, phlebotomy and specimen
handling will be overseen by the CCC teams at MaineHealth, Tufts and MGB. In addition to our outpatient
based networks for enrollment of subjects with erythema migrans in Maine and Massachusetts, the CCC
oversees hospital-based enrollment within our network of subjects with early disseminated Lyme disease, i.e.
Lyme meningitis and/or other acute neurologic presentations and Lyme carditis. The CCC is closely linked to
the Diagnostic Core for integration of subject data, sample distribution and storage. We have created an
organizational structure of the CCC that facilitates integration of Project and Core leadership while providing for
continuous interaction with our outpatient practice leaders."

 The Pilot/Feasibility (P/F) Program of the San Diego Digestive Diseases Research Center (SDDRC)
promotes the development of early-stage investigators into productive and funded researchers. At a time of
increasing NIH budget pressures, it is challenging for promising early-stage faculty to obtain their first
independent research grants in a timely manner to prevent stalling of their careers. Furthermore, it is more
important than ever to provide strategic early support for starting the common cycle of substantial initial data
generation, first grant submission, more data generation, and second revised grant submission. Without a
steady inflow of new investigators and fresh perspectives, research in digestive diseases is liable to slow down
and not be able to fulfill its promises in improving the digestive health and well-being of the public. The P/F
Program also helps to advance digestive diseases research by encouraging seasoned investigators in other
fields to take on challenges in digestive diseases, to facilitate work in new areas by established digestive
diseases investigators with innovative high-risk projects, and to promote collaborative work for advancing new
approaches in digestive diseases research. The SDDRC P/F Program has been highly successful. Over the
past 10-year reporting period (the initial years were in preparation of the original P30 application), the P/F
Program has awarded $891,000 in P/F grants to 24 investigators. The great majority of awards (75%) have
been given to new investigators to support their career development. Current funding rates are ~30%. Past
awardees have had outstanding success in obtaining new grants, having received grants totaling $23.7 million
in direct costs for a nominal return-on-investment of 26.6, and an ultimate funding success rate of ~80%. P/F
awardees had excellent scholarly productivity, with 24 awardees so far having generated 52 publications
related to their P/F projects, and have overwhelmingly (92%) remained in digestive diseases research in
academia, underscoring that our P/F awardees have been highly committed and successful in their research
endeavors and career trajectories in digestive disease research. Building on these accomplishments, the P/F
Program will continue to support 4-5 annual $40,000 P/F grants through a combination of P30 resources and
successful engagement of the home institution and other centers and programs with overlapping interests. The
Program has a robust elicitation and review process with extensive input from external investigators, including
the members of the External Advisory Committee. Together, the P/F Program will advance the SDDRC
mission and benefit SDDRC investigators by providing P/F funds to support innovative projects and promote
career development in research related to the digestive tract and liver."

The failure to find any effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) despite over four decades of
research underscores the critical need for new strategies to prevent or delay disease onset. The proposed
investigation aims to examine mechanisms of risk and resilience to age-related cognitive decline by
leveraging recent advances in cognitive neuroscience and a unique 60-year longitudinal prenatal cohort.
The concept of reserve has been developed to account for the large individual differences in cognitive aging
trajectories, with nascent understanding of potential modifiable determinants of reserve. However,
fundamental questions remain regarding, for instance, the impact of education, cognitively stimulating
activities in adulthood, or early childhood enrichment on reserve mechanisms and cognitive decline.
Previous investigations have been hampered by a number of limitations, including the lack of: 1)
prospective measures of early childhood cognition, needed to address critical issues of reverse causation
plaguing this field; 2) indices of adult cognitive decline over a large time window; 3) measures of relevant
sociobehavioral factors across the entire lifespan; and 4) economic and racial/ethnic diversity of study
samples. This proposal addresses these limitations by extending our continued study of the Providence RI
cohort of the US Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). The original CPP involved systematic data collection
from pregnancy through age 7 years, including measures of three key early life factors thought to influence
cognitive trajectories in later life: early childhood IQ, family SES, and childhood adversity. We conducted a
comprehensive cognitive assessment of 720 members of this cohort at age 35. We propose to reassess
these participants (now approaching age 60) with a detailed neuropsychological battery to examine
cognitive decline over a 25-year period. We will also assess engagement in cognitively stimulating activities,
physical activity, occupational complexity, income, and health status. Participants will provide biosamples
for plasma beta-amyloid (Aβ) 42/40 ratio and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and will undergo structural
and functional MRI, providing operationally-defined brain measures of reserve. Finally, we propose a novel
conceptual framework linking lifespan factors to cognitive outcomes through distinct brain mechanisms.
This framework drives our aims which are: (1) Determine the relative influence of educational attainment,
early life, and adult lifestyle factors on cognitive level and decline in late middle-aged adults; (2) Determine
the relative contributions of specific brain reserve mechanisms to cognitive decline; and (3) Identify major
determinants of brain reserve mechanisms in later life. A projected doubling of the elderly population by
2050 will place tremendous AD-related burden on the U.S. healthcare system. By providing novel insights
into mechanisms of risk and resilience, findings may lead to new strategies to significantly reduce this
burden by delaying cognitive decline and the onset of Alzheimer’s Disease."

The Cancer Research Training Program (CRTP) at the University of Virginia brings together faculty and
trainees with a common interest in cancer biology to participate in an integrated program of cancer research,
education, and discovery. The overall objective of the CRTP is to empower the next generation of cancer
researchers with the tools to become future leaders in the quest to understand oncological processes and
improve patient outcomes. We accomplish these goals through intensive cancer research training coupled with
academic and professional development activities. Together, these provide the trainees with (1) a broad-based
knowledge of fundamental principles in cancer biology; (2) the ability to define and solve vital research
questions using the most current approaches and techniques in the constantly changing landscape of
biomedical research; and (3) the skills to partner with basic scientists, translational researchers, clinical
trialists, clinicians, and cancer patients/survivors to promote discovery and improved outcomes. This renewal
application incorporates a new leadership structure prompted by the addition of Dr. Andrew Dudley as part of a
multi-PI team with the current PI, Dr. Amy Bouton. We request support for 8 predoctoral trainees who will
participate in longitudinal training that includes laboratory research, formal course work, programmatic
activities, exposure to clinical/translational aspects of cancer, programming in professional/career
development, and community outreach opportunities. The 42 CRTP faculty mentors provide a robust and fully
integrated platform through which the program delivers this training. Most importantly, the CRTP takes
advantage of the robust cancer research community provided by the NCI-designated UVA Cancer Center. This
affords the trainees an opportunity to apply their own experiences in basic cancer research to the need for
improved diagnosis and treatments in cancer care. The CRTP has experienced much success over its almost
44-year history. As we move into the next funding period, we challenge ourselves to meet the changing
landscape of cancer research through constant assessment and evolution of the program. In this regard, we
have incorporated a number of new initiatives designed to reinforce community-building, provide new
opportunities for applied learning and professional development, and promote dialogues between trainees and
cancer patients/survivors. This renewal application also includes important new enhancements focused on
training in rigor and reproducibility, mentor training, and the establishment of an Advisory Committee for
Diversity & Inclusion. The full array of CRTP activities, together with a dedicated faculty, talented cadre of
trainees, and vibrant cancer research community, all contribute to producing CRTP alumni who are well-
positioned to become lifelong learners and future leaders in the continually evolving field of cancer research."
10861906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All animals use sensory cues to find their way through complex environments and locate vital resources such
as food or mates. From simple organisms such as worms finding nutrient-rich soil at centimeter-scale
distances to polar bears following their noses across kilometers to feed upon seal carcasses, the ability to
navigate an environment using odors is one of the most evolutionarily ancient and widespread examples of this
complex behavior. Interest in the ability to navigate with odors has spanned decades and resulted in numerous
models suggesting how animals can accomplish this feat. Testing these models is extremely difficult because
in nearly all terrestrial environments odors are transported as fluctuating plumes by turbulent air flow. This
necessitates either the use of simplifying models for odor flow or complex three-dimensional computational
fluid dynamics simulations. In both cases, only statistical connections can be made between the performance
of a simulated searcher and the behavior and neural processing of an animal. This limitation rules out the
ability to combine moment-to-moment neural recordings with the sensory input guiding an animal’s behavior.
This proposal represents a cross-disciplinary effort between experts in fluid dynamics, olfactory systems
neuroscience, and neurophysiology to directly establish the algorithms used for odor-guided navigation and the
neural implementation of these algorithms in the early olfactory system of mice. We will use newly developed,
miniature odor sensors to record odor plumes at the mouse nose during odor-guided navigation. By combining
these sensor readings with computational models of odor flow we will directly test the behavioral algorithms
used by mice to navigate with odor plumes. To establish the neural implementation of these algorithms we will
perform large-scale neural imaging and electrophysiology recordings from the early olfactory system while
monitoring odor plume input at the nose. We will also use viral labeling techniques to selectively record neural
activity from cells that send output to specific downstream cortical structures. By recording neural activity from
olfactory bulb cells with specific cortical targets we will test how odor information is routed from sensory to
decision-making areas to support odor-guided navigation. Finally, we will combine these levels of analysis to
generate a complete model of odor-guided navigation that connects behavioral algorithms to neural
implementation."

Older adults are at higher risk of toxicity and progressive severe effects related to cancer treatment.
They experience numerous side effects from cancer treatment including chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting (CINV), but often undermanage it because they do not believe their actions to
self-manage CINV will be effective. Many older adults report taking anti-nausea medication only
when CINV is severe and some adopt a ‘watchful waiting” strategy as they wait for CINV to go away on
its own. This lack of self- management leads to reduced daily functioning, reduced adherence to
treatment, increased healthcare use (emergency department and hospital admissions) and cost, and
lower quality of life. There is a critical need for new strategies to assist older adults in engaging in
more active preventative and self-management behaviors at home to reduce negative outcomes. Our
team developed and tested a serious game intervention that directly addresses older adults’ erroneous
beliefs about CINV management. The eSSET-CINV intervention is a technology-based educational
simulation in which older adults learn to apply what they have previously learned about CINV self-
management strategies to an avatar who is at high risk for nausea at home after chemotherapy.
Players make decisions to prevent CINV and to self-manage it when it occurs. Our preliminary study
showed that older adults who were exposed to the eSSET-CINV intervention used twice as many
CINV preventative strategies than those who did not get the intervention. The goal of this study is to
determine the eSSET-CINV’s effectiveness at reducing CINV severity and healthcare use and
increasing functioning and quality of life. We will use a 2-group (intervention, attention control)
randomized clinical trial design. Aim 1 of this study is to examine changes in CINV severity, self-
management behaviors, functioning, QOL, cognitive representation and healthcare use within the
intervention group from baseline to completion of the study. Aim 2 is to determine efficacy of the
eSSET-CINV intervention by comparing differences in primary outcomes (CINV severity, healthcare
use) and secondary outcomes (self-management behaviors, functioning, and QOL) between groups at
each follow-up visit and completion of the study. A sample of 500 older adults will be recruited. The
intervention group will receive the eSSET-CINV at baseline, the attention control will receive it at the
end of the study. Both groups will be followed for 6 months. Our long-term goal is to develop unique,
culturally relevant serious games that allow older adults to practice making side-effect related self-
care decisions at home in a no-risk simulated environment. This research addresses the NIH research
priorities facilitating changes in cancer symptom prevention and self-management through increasing
positive health behaviors and improved health outcomes in an understudied population."
10836990,"Project Summary: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common
autosomal dominant disorder in humans (5). Approximately 600,000 people in the U.S. and more than 10
million people world-wide are affected, causing a large heath care burden and patient morbidity (6)(7). ADPKD
is characterized by a progressive enlargement of multiple renal cysts that leads to a decline in renal function
and culminates in renal failure in 50% of all patients (8). 85% of the cases caused by mutations in PKD1 (9). In
many genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, disease morbidity and mortality are delayed by treatment of
the symptoms (10). In ADPKD, there is no treatment regimen that reduces the need for renal transplants
(11). Although tolvaptan is a drug approved for ADPKD, it has significant side effects and low efficiency
(12). Clearly, there is still a critical need to develop new treatments. We provide compelling preliminary data
demonstrating that VX-809, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector, can
reduce cyst growth and improve renal function in both aggressive and slow-onset mouse models. We propose
the novel hypothesis that VX-809 can be used as a treatment for ADPKD. This drug is already in clinical
use (13) and can be fast-tracked for the treatment of ADPKD. The goal is to provide a strong mechanistic
background for CFTR modulators such as VX-809, VX-661, VX-770 to move them forward as a treatment for
ADPKD and to establish a new paradigm based on rearranging key transport mechanisms to transport fluid
out of the cysts. We are proposing three Specific Aims to: 1. Enhance the therapeutic potential of CFTR
modulators by defining how they reduce cyst size in ADPKD. The aim will expand the scope of the
usefulness of CFTR modulators as a therapy for ADPKD and show definitively that CFTR correctors reduce
cyst size by promoting the absorption of fluid from the cyst lumen. 2. Provide a scientific foundation for the
therapeutic use of CFTR modulators to treat ADPKD. We hypothesize that VX-809 stabilizes CFTR in the
basolateral cell membrane and restores NHE3 and ENaC to the apical cell membrane, thereby enhancing the
absorption of cyst fluid. This Aim will address how these transporters are abnormally arranged in cysts and
how they can be reversed back to normal, therapeutically. 3. Extend the use of CFTR modulators to treat
different stages of ADPKD. We will expand our study to evaluate the action of CFTR correctors alone and in
combination with CFTR potentiators in early- and late-onset mouse models, which mimic different stages of
human disease. This Aim is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of long-term treatment.
Significance: As of yet, there is no therapy for ADPKD that reduces the need for a renal transplant. Thus, this
proposal is highly significant because it addresses the potential for a new therapy for ADPKD based upon CFTR
correctors that are already approved for clinical use for patients with cystic fibrosis. It also establishes a new
therapeutic paradigm based upon drugs that promote fluid absorption out of the cysts."

electrophiles such as α,β-unsaturated carbonyls are present in the environment and diet, but they are also
produced endogenously during metabolism and oxidative stress. They have been linked to the etiology of diverse
pathological states such as atherosclerosis, cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. Understanding the
roles of reactive electrophilic species in homeostasis and disease will provide important guidance for disease
prevention and the development of new therapeutics. However, a lack of research tools has impeded such
endeavors and many studies in this field lack experimental rigor. The problem is that these reactive electrophilic
species irreversibly modify a large number of biomolecules with very little control by the scientist. The program
will close critical methodological gaps in the research on the effects of electrophiles in biology. Anticipated
deliverables are methods that enable the controlled generation of such electrophiles at specific times and
locations. Furthermore, methods to controllably reverse the formed covalent adducts of such electrophiles will
be developed. Additionally, screening technologies to develop molecules that target specific protein residues will
be established. The methods are innovative because they allow answering important biomedical questions that
are currently out of reach. The program’s preliminary studies have established a solid foundation to achieve
these goals. We have developed chemical reactions that allow generating α,β-unsaturated carbonyls on-demand
in living systems, and we have established DNA-encoded libraries for the discovery of bioactive species. With
these unique capabilities in hand, the research program is in the position to advance the understanding of
reactive electrophilic species in biology and their impact on disease. To demonstrate their utility, we will apply
them to study the involvement of 4-hydroxynonenal in atherosclerosis and study the dynamics of adaptive states
associated with resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors of pancreatic cancer. We will take steps to ensure that the
developed methods will be available to a broad range of scientists to maximize the impact of the program."
10837014,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a currently untreatable genetic disease in which skeletal muscle
repair is redirected to endochondral bone formation (heterotopic ossification, HO) causing pain, muscle
destruction, and joint fusion, leading to progressive immobilization and eventually premature death. This project
will explore the role of microbiota in inflammation and HO in FOP. Aim 1: Identify the modulatory roles of the gut
microbiome in disease progression in FOP mice. Advanced gnotobiotic methods and germ-free FOP mice
colonized with defined pro- or anti-inflammatory microbiota. We will also test whether dietary supplementation with
probiotic bacteria or compounds that tighten gut barrier integrity will reduce FOP progression. Aim 2: Identify the
role of the microbiome in chemokine-dependent polarization and migration of MCYs and macrophages that
enhance EHO in FOP. These studies will determine whether the gut microbiome exacerbates EHO in FOP by
sensitizing bone marrow MCYs/MΦs to chemokine-induced chemotaxis and increasing the expression of
proinflammatory chemokines during flares, which together increase infiltration and inflammatory polarization of
MCYs and MΦs. Aim 3: Establish the relationship between gut microbiota, monocyte/macrophage
activation, and severity of FOP flares in humans and mice. These studies will determine if the gut microbial
community in patients with FOP modulates disease progression by increasing systemic inflammatory tone, thus
priming MCY/MΦ activation. Stool samples will be collected from patients with FOP, microbiota analyzed and
correlated with FOP disease outcomes. We will also colonize germ-free FOP mice with the microbiome of human
FOP patients by fecal transplant in a human microbiome-association (HMA) approach. Finally, we will use a new
microfluidic culture system to determine the responses of human iPSC derived M1- and M2-like MΦs from control
and FOP patients to defined microbiome antigens.These studies will provide novel mechanistic understanding of
how the gut microbiome affects HO and provide a basis for testing how gut microbiome manipulation may augment
treatment of FOP and non-genetic HO."
10837124,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in majority of tumors including oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC). The over-expressed/-activated EGFR contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and tumor progression by contributing to tumor metastasis and chemo-resistance. Hence, EGFR has
become one of the major therapeutic targets for OSCC. Endocytosis is a key biological pathway for internalization
of ligand activated EGFR, following which it gets routed for lysosomal degradation by the endosomal sorting
complex for recruitment and transport (ESCRT) machinery. ESCRT is a key mediator of endocytic vesicle
trafficking (EVT). While vesicle trafficking defects result in the poor downregulation of activated EGFR, persistent
surface and cellular EGFR expression and signaling is subsequently linked to the development of cancer.
Surprisingly, the molecular events/mechanisms that regulate ESCRT pathway which is critical for maintaining
EGFR homeostasis and preventing EMT and tumorigenesis are largely unknown.
Here, based on solid preliminary data, we propose to investigate a previously unknown mechanism that regulates
ESCRT dependent EVT, EGFR levels and signaling, EMT, and OSCC growth. We found that 1) depletion of
CPAP caused the prolonged expression of EGFR and an EMT-like phenotype in oral cancer cells; 2) while
depletion of CPAP enhanced the tumorigenicity of an OSCC cell line, overexpression of CPAP in this cell line
suppressed its tumor inducing potential; 3) overexpression of CPAP caused the de novo generation of EGFR-
positive multivesicular bodies, whose biogenesis requires ESCRT and are essential intermediates that route
EGFR to lysosomes for degradation and termination of its signaling; and 4) the absence of CPAP resulted in
diminished cellular levels of VPS4 protein, an essential ESCRT associated ATPase that facilitates pinching off
of endocytic vesicles. These collective observations suggest that CPAP induced positive regulation of ESCRT
pathway and EVT maintains EGFR homeostasis, resulting in prevention of EMT and tumorigenesis in OSCC.
This novel hypothesis will be tested systematically under two specific aims. The primary goals of aim 1 will be to
define the molecular mechanisms by which CPAP positively regulates EVT and EGFR homeostasis in OSCC.
This will be done by using OSCC and normal oral cells with gain-and-loss-of-function of CPAP as well as by
studying CPAP-ESCRT interaction in the context of EGFR homeostasis. We will then, under aim 2, determine
the role of CPAP in preventing EMT and oral tumorigenesis. This will be achieved by characterizing CPAP gain-
and-loss-of-function in OSCC cell lines for EMT features, and growth and tumorigenic properties, and by studying
the oral cancer susceptibility using a conditional CPAP-knockout mice. Overall, this study will delineate a novel
ESCRT dependent mechanism that prevents OSCC."

PROJECT SUMMARY
This S10 SIG proposal requests NIH support to purchase a VisualSonics Vevo F2 ultrasound system by the
University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This system is specifically designed for pre-clinical small animal research
to enable cost-effective, robust and longitudinal studies. Ultrasound imaging provides sensitive, high-speed and
high-resolution 3-dimensional and time-resolved dynamic data, and greater tissue penetration for anatomical
architecture and physiological functions in small animal models of human biology and diseases. This newer
generation ultrasound imager will replace our heavily used Vevo 2100 imager that has been phased out by the
manufacturer with a termination of maintenance support at the end of 2023. To sustain and expand the research
missions at UIC, we need to purchase the Vevo F2 system that is the currently available replacement model and
has significantly enhanced capabilities. The functions of Vevo F2 are supported by improved software (Vevo
strain, LV trace tool, autoLV analysis, high-definition image processing and Vevo Vasc) that will reduce the time
of analysis and improve the accuracy and reproducibility of data.
To support the high volumes of productive basic and translational research at UIC, this instrument will be a
crucial core equipment to be used by a broad range of researchers in multiple departments across UIC campus.
It will support 14 major users (all of them are NIH-funded PIs) and 8 minor users (6 of them are NIH-funded PIs)
working on 49 external grant-supported research programs including 45 NIH-funded projects. To facilitate the
access of all users across UIC campus, the instruments will be operated and managed by the Cardiovascular
Resources Core of UIC. The instrument will be housed in a dedicated space within the Biological Resources
Laboratory in the College of Medicine where the major animal facility of UIC is located. We have formed a
Technical Support Team with expertise in ultrasound imaging to provide training and technical support to users,
including new investigators who need to develop new research projects and trainees to enrich their career
development. An Advisory Committee chaired by UIC Vice Chancellor for Research will oversight administration
and compliance and resolve user time conflicts and any other issues that may arise.
 Continuing from our track record of effective and financially sustainable operation and management of the
Vevo 2100 instrument, the new Vevo F2 system will be operated for the maximum benefit to a larger usership.
Our strong institutional commitments include the support of core staff salary, instrument space and covering the
maintenance service contract for the new Vevo F2 instrument. A financial sustainability plan is designed based
on our
Vevo 2100 usage and cost recovery data to ensure sustainable operation of the Vevo F2 to provide
effective and enhanced ultrasound imaging services to strengthen the productive research missions at UIC."

Atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of death worldwide. Current
therapies mainly focus on managing the risk of atherosclerosis, rather than directly targeting the plaque-
causing cells. However, these treatments still carry a significant residual risk for CVD, along with various side
effects. Epigenetics and metabolism often occur early in various diseases and their close interaction has led to
the emergence of the concept of “metaboloepigenetics”. Yet, the precise mechanisms by which they respond
to environmental cues and contribute to chromatin modifications in atherosclerosis remains unaddressed.
Global changes in the epigenome are driven in part by the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF)
chromatin remodeling complex. This complex utilize the ATP energy to alter chromatin structure and modulate
chromatin accessibility to various molecular players, such as transcriptional machinery, cofactors. The mutually
exclusive BAF60 subunits serve as a link between the SWI/SNF complex and specific transcription factors. We
have demonstrated that BAF60c is essential for preservation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)
contractile phenotype by strengthening serum response factor (SRF) association with its coactivator P300 and
the SWI/SNF complex. Our preliminary data further show that BAF60c is the most abundant BAF60 family
member specifically expressed in VSMC in the normal arterial wall, and its expression decreases in human
and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, BAF60c deficiency in VSMC aggravates atherosclerosis in
mice. Knockdown of BAF60c leads to disturbed PPARγ activation and VSMC dysfunction, characteried by
increased anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative stress, lipid accumulation, transition to macrophage-like cells and
foam cells. Therefore, I hypothesized that BAF60c-PPARγ axis protects against atherogenesis through
metaboloepigenetic modulation of VSMC homeostasis. Our long-term objectives are to elucidate how
metabolo-epigenetic interplay modulates vascular cell behavior and fate in CVD and to uncover novel
therapeutic avenues for CVD by targeting BAF60c-dependent metaboloepigenetic modifications. Specifically,
Aim 1 will define the protective role of BAF60c-PPARγ axis in atherogenesis using both male and female
VSMC-specific knockout and transgenic mice; Aim 2 will define the mechanisms underlying BAF60c-PPARγ
axis in regulation of VSMC dysfunction in atherosclerosis in vitro. In summary, these studies will provide
unique mechanistic insights into the role of Baf60c-dependent metaboloepigenetics in VSMC homeostasis
during atherosclerosis. They will pave the way for further exploration of metaboloepigenetics in CVD. In
addition, these findings will support future endeavors to target BAF60c-dependent metaboloepigenetics and to
combine metabolism inhibitors and epigenetic modulators as potential therapeutic strategies for CVD."

 NMR spectroscopy has revolutionized the identification and study of molecules relevant to
human health. Within this technique, the needs of individual research groups can vary widely,
necessitating support by versatile NMR spectrometers capable of serving diverse research
programs. We propose the acquisition of a new 400 MHz spectrometer and associated
autosampler to replace an antiquated (ca. 20 years old) but heavily relied-upon instrument in the
Small Molecule NMR facility at Vanderbilt University. The proposed instrument includes a modern
console and 5 mm BBFO probe for the observation of nuclei ranging from 1H (400 MHz) to 109Ag
(19 MHz) as well as variable temperature capability in the range of -150 to +150 °C. This
instrument will support research groups engaged in cutting-edge research in the chemical and
biochemical sciences at Vanderbilt University including efforts in small molecule total synthesis,
glycoscience, catalysis, C-H activation, and natural products discovery, representing the diversity
of needs for NMR capabilities in the modern biomedical sciences.
 The Small Molecule NMR facility at Vanderbilt has a long history of effective management and
maintenance of its spectrometers, but they are now approaching the end of their service life. At
the same time, a new cohort of young investigators are advancing research programs that
demand new capabilities. The primary motivation for this instrument request is a need for
enhanced heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy at Vanderbilt University. Contemporary research
efforts now requite routine and walk-up access to 1H, 11B, 15N, 19F, and 31P NMR and associated
two-dimensional experiments which our antiquated instrumentation is insufficiently equipped to
provide. High-sensitivity electronics and a new 60-position autosampler capable of safely handling
small volume, gas-tight, and screw-capped NMR tubes will support the increasing demand for
experiments outside of the traditional paradigm of routine 1H and 13C NMR on abundant, air-stable
small molecules, for instance, high-throughput 19F and 15N NMR on dilute samples.
 In total, this proposal will modernize the capabilities of the Small Molecule NMR facility at
Vanderbilt University and empower next-generation research programs with new and needed
tools in proton and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy."
10836512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Clinical Research Core (RC1) is a key resource for the University of Florida (UF) Older Americans
Independence Center (OAIC), providing the resources and expertise for conducting research across the
spectrum of clinical investigation, including clinical trials, as well as observational studies of biological and
behavioral factors related to promotion of mobility and independence. The Core’s primary goal is to
encourage and facilitate clinical translational research focused on promotion of mobility and independence.
The RC1 has three Specific Aims:
 1. Aim 1: Provide the resources and intellectual environment to facilitate clinical research, team science,
 and education of OAIC REC Scholars, including under-represented investigators, related to promotion
 of mobility and independence.
2. Aim 2: Promote and facilitate translation of pre-clinical and pilot studies into clinical trials in older
 persons with consideration for sex and ethnicity/race.
3. Aim 3: Improve our understanding of behavioral, biological, cognitive, and social/environmental factors,
 with a focus on health disparities, that may affect responses to interventions, designed to promote
 mobility and independence in older adults.
The RC1 provides resources and personnel (including U01 and R01 NIH funded investigators) to support the
development and implementation of clinical trials, including pharmacologic, nutritional and behavioral
interventions, and observational studies addressing factors contributing to mobility impairment in older adults
and implications for functional decline and disability. Building on close collaborations with other OAIC cores,
the RC1 will support pilot/exploratory projects, developmental projects, and external projects. The Core will
also provide senior level Investigators with established track records as mentors for research education to lead
each of these goals, providing expertise and promoting a rich environment for early stage faculty research and
senior faculty collaboration."
10836514,"Summary
 The University of Florida (UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) supports the overall
theme of “promotion of mobility and independence.” The Metabolism and Translational Science Core (RC2), in
collaboration with our other UF OAIC cores, supports biochemical analyses for preclinical, human
interventional, or observational clinical studies. By measuring a selected set of biomarkers, we can determine
how targeted interventions influence the rate of aging, as well as loss of mobility and independence. This core
thereby provides the support for the Research Education Core (REC) Scholars and pilot study investigators.
 Aging and disease feature progressive deterioration of various physiological and metabolic processes.
This is associated with altered functions or contents of protein, RNA, and DNA, which provide biomarkers to
monitor aging. Multiple pathways and domains have been associated with aging, such as genomic instability
(including telomere attrition, mutations, and deletions); epigenetic alterations; loss of proteostasis (including
dysfunctional autophagy); deregulated nutrient sensing; mitochondrial (Mt) dysfunction; inflammation and
cellular senescence; stem cell exhaustion, disrupted circadian clock rhythms; and dysfunctional nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) homeostasis. The specific analyses of protein, RNA, and DNA biomarkers that
this core will provide are related to major biological and metabolic pathways known to regulate aging and focus
on: (i) Mt function; (ii) inflammation and senescence; (iii) autophagy; (iv) circadian clock biology; and
(v) NAD+ homeostasis. We use innovative analytical tools and standard high-throughput analysis to
determine the fundamental biological mechanisms of aging. The Metabolism and Translational Science Core
(RC2) supports the overarching hypothesis that knowledge of specific protein, RNA, and DNA biomarkers, as
well as measurements of metabolism of isolated mitochondria and white blood cells (WBCs), are critical for
understanding the trajectory of healthy aging and the underlying biological causes of mobility loss.
 We will support extraction of proteins, RNA, and DNA; analysis of biomarkers; isolation of cells (WBCs)
and organelles (mitochondria); and assessments of Mt function. RC2 will provide investigators across the
OAIC Cores and REC Scholars with established methodologies; scientific data; infrastructure; highly qualified
personnel; and consultative and collaborative expertise. We have a rich history of completing studies for REC
Scholars and senior investigators at UF, as well as scientists around the country.
RC2 pursues the following aims:
Aim 1: To support protein, RNA, and DNA isolation and analysis of specific biomarkers of aging.
Aim 2: To support analysis of Mt respiration, Mt enzyme activities, and NAD coenzymes.
Aim 3: To facilitate and provide consultation on analyses and sample storage, and collaborate synergistically
with the other OAIC cores to pursue the common OAIC theme of promotion of mobility and independence."

Data Science and Applied Technology (DSAT) Core (RC4), the most recent addition to the University of Florida
(UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC), provides an interactive data and technology ecosystem
for promote mobility and independence. Big data initiatives, applied technologies, and new methodological
approaches for data science have exploded in many various environments, and the world is moving toward a
connected system of computing and sensing components. The broadly used phrase “connected health” refers
to an environment in which detailed data are collected on health, activity, location, and other aspects of the
participating entities. Flexible control of the different interconnected and frequently communicating components
can provide a rich set of applications that learn dynamically from data streams. Artificial intelligence (AI)
promises to transform our ability to harness these data streams to advance science and improve health. The
core uses techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to transform data utility through computer
models that use data to learn, predict and – potentially – infer causation. Additionally, DSAT is on the forefront
of mobile health (mHealth, smartphones and smartwatches) technologies that are changing the landscape for
how patients and research participants communicate about their health in real time. Importantly, the core
efforts are specifically targeted to older adults — a population that is often forgotten in these regards. DSAT
provides a central hub of expertise in gerontology/geriatrics, computer engineering, mHealth, applied
technology, and epidemiology. As a result, DSAT provides many unique attributes to the UF OAIC and
nationally that:
 • Support OAIC cores, train and provide resources to REC Scholars, researchers and practitioners;
 • Advance interactive monitoring and remote health using mobile devices designed for older adults;
 • Use and develop data repositories and repurpose existing data to support new research on mobility;
 • Conduct machine learning, artificial intelligence, and pattern discovery analyses;
 • Collaborate with partnering OAIC cores to develop new research endeavors on promoting mobility;
 • Enhance externally supported projects.
DSAT addresses many aspects of major national initiatives outlined in ""Advancing Artificial Intelligence R&D""
and ""Emerging technologies to support an aging population"" and is poised to meet these new initiatives. Given
is interdisciplinary approach, it is well-suited to lead the UF OAIC into the future of connected health, mobile
technology, advanced sensing, artificial intelligence and machine learning specifically geared toward promoting
mobility and independence in older adults."
10852182,"The anatomical knee is a complex, polycentric joint characterized by a large range of motion in the sagittal plane
and limited mobility in the coronal and transverse planes (1). The sagittal plane motion is used for progression
in stance phase, and limb clearance and advancement in swing (2). Limb prostheses are intended to restore
function and cosmesis in persons with limb loss. The complexity and function of prosthetic components have
advanced significantly as technology has improved, but a state-of-the-art artificial limb is still a relatively poor
substitute for an anatomical one. Microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs) do not typically utilize motors to power
joint rotation, but they automatically adjust resistance or damping in the joint to improve swing- and/or stance-
phase control as appropriate for the user during gait. The Ossur Power Knee (6-9), which was first introduced in
2006, is the only MPK that uses a motor to provide active power generation during walking and other activities
involving knee flexion and extension. Last year, Ossur released the 3rd generation of its Power Knee and
appears to have addressed many of the previous shortcomings in terms of reduced weight, less noise, lower
cost and longer battery life. Therefore, we believe that the newest version of the Power Knee warrants a fresh
evaluation since it is, in essence, substantially different in design and function from previous models.
The purpose of this proposed investigation is to perform biomechanical evaluations of the new Ossur Power
Knee during walking and other activities by transfemoral prosthesis users. Using a cross-over experimental
design, approximately 20 unilateral, transfemoral amputee subjects (10 men and 10 women) will be evaluated
in the Jesse Brown VAMC Motion Analysis Research Laboratory (MARL) while wearing the Ossur Power Knee
and Ossur Rheo XC, which is a passive MPK device. Furthermore, we believe that the Ossur Power Knee may
offer distinct advantages to female prosthesis users, so we intend to compare mobility between men and women
to determine if differences exist on the basis of sex. The specific aims and hypotheses of this project are:
 Aim 1: To compare the effects of the Ossur Power Knee and Ossur Rheo XC on the gait of unilateral,
 transfemoral prosthesis users during level walking. Kinematic and kinetic data will be collected as
 subjects walk in the MARL. We hypothesize that the active knee flexion and extension provided by
 the Ossur Power Knee will (1) improve walking performance, and (2) reduce metabolic energy cost
 during ambulation.
 Aim 2: To compare the effects of the Ossur Power Knee and Ossur Rheo XC on stairs, slopes and during
 sit-to-stand/stand-to-sit activities of unilateral, transfemoral prosthesis users. Kinematic data will be
 collected as subjects perform these activities. We hypothesize that subjects will have improved
 performance when using the Ossur Power Knee.
 Aim 3: To analyze and compare gender specific data between subjects using the Ossur Power Knee and
 the Ossur Rheo XC. We hypothesize that male and female subjects will demonstrate substantially
 different abilities to use the two knee components, indicating that gender specific components should
 be further investigated and developed. Research focusing on the unique prosthetic needs of women
 Veterans is currently a special emphasis area of the VA RR&D Service.
Subjects will also be administered questionnaires and provided at-home diaries to document their perceptions
of comfort, exertion and stability while using the different prosthetic knee units. Increased understanding about
how the Ossur Power Knee affects the abilities of transfemoral prosthesis users will facilitate appropriate
component selection by prosthetists and ultimately improve quality of life for prosthesis users."

High resolution in vivo micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging and analysis of bone and other tissues
(fat, muscle, contrast-enhanced vasculature) has become a “gold standard” technique in longitudinal studies,
but our institution currently lacks such an instrument. Augusta University (AU) has many NIH-supported projects
that would benefit from this high resolution tool, which would enhance the precision, rigor, and reproducibility of
our investigators’ funded and preliminary studies. Our Functional Outcomes core possesses a high-resolution
ex vivo microCT instrument that is used at maximum capacity by investigators studying bone, teeth, and
vasculature in isolated tissue samples, and a lower resolution in vivo DXA instrument used heavily by
investigators studying bone density and body composition. In this proposal, a group of diverse investigators with
well-established research programs and active NIH support have documented their need for the new, high-
resolution microCT system, particularly a machine with novel in vivo capabilities compared to the ex vivo microCT
scanner currently used. The Functional Outcomes Core at AU, which runs the existing ex vivo microCT and
DXA instrumentation, has extensive scientific, technical, and administrative experience with in vivo and ex vivo
imaging technology, including microCT. Over the past decade, this Core has established an exceptional national
and international reputation for technical efficiency and scientific integrity, reflected by the number of manuscripts
published in reputable journals and successful grant awards. The collective expertise in microCT technology at
AU will ensure that the new in vivo microCT system will be utilized to its full potential and well maintained. The
new system will also provide critical support to early stage investigators at AU, as well as catalyze more
collaborations and serve as an attractive feature for recruiting new faculty. The administration at AU is fully in
support the proposal and has agreed to support the annual service contract for the machine; full support for a
technician’s time will be provided by an active Program Project Grant (PPG) award and the institution. However,
due to strict institutional budgetary limitations, internal resources will not allow the purchase of a new machine
without this funding mechanism. In summary, there is a critical need for this in vivo microCT technology on our
campus, and the only way to acquire it is through the S10 mechanism. The new machine will permit longitudinal,
high resolution, in vivo, 3D, site-specific analyses of mineralized and soft tissues that cannot be performed with
existing instruments. Procurement of an in vivo microCT will enhance the rigor of ongoing experiments from a
substantial number of our institution’s NIH-funded investigators and reduce our investigators’ needs for
vertebrate animals in their experiments. Our Core has extensive expertise in the technology and has developed
a robust administrative structure and oversight for the usage of this new instrument. Our institution is in full
support of this award. Collectively, this award will be a worthwhile investment that serves the mission of the NIH."

The property of sensing and propagating external cues that drive directional migration is a fundamental property
of biological systems, and is essential to physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis,
adult tissue homeostasis, inflammation and immune responses, and metastatic invasion. This proposal aims at
understanding how chemotactic signals are packaged and propagated between neighboring cells during
chemotaxis. To do so, we study human neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes in normal human blood. When
exposed to primary chemoattractants like N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), which is secreted by pathogens
invading the body and by necrotic cells at sites of injury, neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization that allows them
to efficiently migrate up the fMLF gradient. As they react to fMLF, neutrophils secrete secondary
chemoattractants that serve to maintain the robustness and sensitivity to the primary chemoattractant signals.
We established that the secondary chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is required for the massive recruitment
of neutrophils to sites of injury in vitro and in vivo. In order for LTB4 to act as a bona fide signal relay molecule,
it must be released in a form that enables the generation of a stable gradient during chemotaxis. In this context,
we established that LTB4 is packaged in vesicles in chemotaxing neutrophils as a way to effectively disseminate
gradients between neighboring cells. We found that LTB4 and its synthesizing enzymes – 5-lipoxigenase (5-LO)
and 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) - localize to intracellular multivesicular bodies (MBVs) which, upon
chemoattractant stimulation, release their content as exosomes, thereby acting as a packaging mechanism to
relay chemotactic signals. Further, we found that MVB biogenesis appears to be initiated at the nuclear envelope
(NE) in activated neutrophils. We hypothesize that the NE is a novel site of MVB formation that enables
packaging of the LTB4 synthetic machineryinto secretory MVBs that release exosomes to relay of signals during
neutrophil chemotaxis. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will directly visualize 5-LO and FLAP dynamics in
live cells using mCherry/GFP fusions and photoactivatable reporters under normal conditions and when
endocytosis is blocked. We will also assess the role of FLAP clustering as a driving force for MVB biogenesis at
the NE, by generating FLAP mutants with distinct affinities for the 5-LO substrate arachidonic acid. Since integral
membrane proteins clustering is considered a hallmark of ordered membrane microdomains, in Aim 2 we will
define the role of nuclear lipid micro-domains in MVB biogenesis. Finally, in Aim 3 we will establish the role of
membrane remodeling complexes in the formation of the nuclear MVBs by assessing the role of ESCRTs in this
process and identify accessory proteins involved in NE remodeling. This project is poised to provide much
needed insight into the mechanisms regulating the genesis of chemotactic signals during neutrophil chemotaxis
and will bring unprecedented knowledge into the role of the NE in the biogenesis of MVBs and in the interplay
between lipid- and ESCRT-dependent pathways in their biogenesis."
10856917,"Despite growing concerns about validity, the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework plays a key
role in organizing basic, translational, and clinical research. RDoC’s approach to fear and anxiety is categorical:
threat is either acute or potential; engages either the Amygdala or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST);
and elicits either fear or anxiety. Recent work casts doubt on this binary perspective, spurring the development
of alternative approaches. Dimensional models posit that threat responses vary along a smooth continuum of
perceived danger—from absolutely safety to on-going attack. Danger perceptions are thought to emerge from
parametric estimates of threat proximity, probability, and certainty, which are computed in weakly segregated
cortico-subcortical circuits. To date, there have been no systematic, well-powered efforts to computationally
implement these competing models and compare their validity. Furthermore, while both models highlight the
importance of threat uncertainty, they do not specify which kind. Computational psychiatry recognizes 2
mathematically distinct kinds of uncertainty: Risk and Ambiguity. Which of these is more relevant to threat
reactivity and how they map onto the underlying neurobiology is unknown. To address these fundamental
questions, we will recruit a racially diverse community sample enriched for elevated fear/anxiety symptoms. Two
parametric threat-anticipation paradigms will allow us to simultaneously probe circuits sensitive to categorical
(RDoC) and dimensional variation in threat for the first time. Smartphone phenotyping will assess real-world
threat exposure, uncertainty, and distress. A1. We will test a series of competing predictions about the
architecture of threat-sensitive brain circuits. We will use theory-driven computational modeling to go beyond
binary threat categories; identify regions sensitive to risk, ambiguity, and other dimensional facets of threat; and
explore trial-by-trial relations with signs and symptoms of fear and anxiety. A2. RDoC implies that Acute and
Potential Threat are represented in different patterns of brain activity; indeed, this was the major rationale for
creating separate RDoC constructs. Dimensional models predict substantial similarities. Multivoxel machine-
learning approaches provide a rigorous means of adjudicating these claims and clarifying the importance of the
Amygdala, BST, and other regions. A3. Fusing the fMRI and smartphone data-streams will enable us to establish
the relevance of specific facets of threat and specific brain regions to real-world distress. We will also explore
relations between neuroimaging metrics and fear- and anxiety-related diagnoses, symptoms, and traits.
Significance. Extreme fear and anxiety are leading causes of human misery and morbidity. This project will
provide a potentially transformative opportunity to develop the first computationally grounded model of fear and
anxiety. It will help adjudicate on-going theoretical debates, validate a new conceptual approach for use with
other read-outs and species, set the stage for new kinds of translational models and clinical studies, prioritize
new targets for neuromodulation and other therapeutics development, and guide the development of RDoC 2.0."
10856192,"Abstract
About 296 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Chronic HBV infection
is the main risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is no cure for HBV, and FDA-approved anti-
HBV drugs failed to achieve much desired loss of serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in most cases.
Mechanisms of HBV infection/pathogenesis are not fully understood, which affects therapy options. During
HBV replication, in 5-20% of cases, the RNA primer is not translocated during (+) strand DNA synthesis,
priming in situ occurs, and the reverse transcription produces not the usual relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) but
double stranded DNA linear genome (DSL) that can be randomly integrated into cellular DNA brakes using
help of host DNA repair enzymes. Over time many hepatocytes acquire HBV integrants. A progeny virus is not
produced from the integrants, but different RNA species are transcribed from the integrants. They are under-
studied. Among them are 5'-human-HBV-3' hybrid RNAs that are initiated from cellular promoter upstream of
the integrant and then crossed into the integrated HBV sequence. We found such RNAs in liver/HCC tissues
and sera harvested from chronic HBV carriers and in cell lines that were generated from HBV-related HCCs
and bear HBV integrants. Not much is known about these RNAs. Our recent data gained using a small number
of samples and doing long-read RNA sequencing (long-read RNA-seq) suggested that such RNAs (i) are
common; (ii) can accumulate to sizeable levels; (iii) are 5'-human-HBV-3' RNAs and are not 5'-human-HBV-
human-3' RNAs; (iv) have the length of about 360 to 3800 nucleotides; (v) often come from not full-length DSL
lacking considerable left hand side area; and (vi) are often polyadenylated via cryptic HBV polyadenylation
signal (PAS). This study will examine these RNAs in detail. In Aim 1, we will use liver/HCC tissues from chronic
HBV carriers and cell lines derived from HBV-related HCCs and bearing HBV integrants, and using long-read
RNA-seq will examine the sequence features of the 5'-human-HBV-3' RNAs, such as the sequences of human
and HBV parts, positions of polyadenylation in HBV sequence and related PAS, human-HBV junctions; will
establish the origins of these RNAs as if they come from full-length of truncated DSL; will identify HBV-HBV
recombinant and spliced sequences, multiple transcripts derived from the same integrant, etc.; and generate
summary diagram depicting detailed common features of such RNAs. In Aim 2, using long-read RNA-seq data,
we will design specific RT-qPCRs and determine the levels for 5'-human-HBV-3' RNAs in comparison to the
HBV replication-derived RNAs. In Aim 3, we will use long-read RNA-seq data from Aim 1 and make the vectors
expressing 5'-human-HBV-3' RNAs, and, using transfection of Huh7 or HepG2 cells, examine these RNAs' (i)
accumulation and stability, (ii) ability to regulate the levels of HBV genome replication, and (iii) potential to alter
the host genes' expression. Overall, the proposed study will advance our understanding of the natural 5'-
human-HBV-3' RNAs' sequences organization, their biological functions and role in HBV life cycle."
10858774,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Periodontitis is one of the most common human health conditions and is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting
the tooth-supporting structures resulting from the actions of polymicrobial communities of organisms that induce
destructive immune responses. Progression of periodontitis is associated with a microbial population shift and
synergistic interactions between pathobionts such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. T.
denticola emerges as one of the most abundant bacteria in diseased periodontal sites and is predictive of the
severity and progression of periodontitis. The mechanisms that allow T. denticola to thrive in the diseased
periodontium remain poorly defined. Two-component signal (TCS) transduction systems are ubiquitous sensory
transduction systems in bacteria that often sense environmental stimuli to mediate cellular responses via genetic
regulation. Our scientific premise is that TCSs allow T. denticola to sense and respond to changing periodontal
environments, promoting persistence, interactions with other oral bacteria, and pathogenicity. We have initiated
the characterization of the AtcS/AtcR and Hpk2/Rrp2 TCS of T. denticola, which represents half of the TCS
encoded in the genome. We have characterized the AtcR binding motif and identified genes that contain the
AtcR binding motif within their promoter. Interestingly, the promoter regulating the expression of the Hpk2/Rrp2
TCS is bound by AtcR. Yet, AtcR-mediated regulation of gene expression and the impact on T. denticola cellular
processes are untested. We have observed that Hpk2 kinase activity is regulated by oxygen. However, the role
of Rrp2 as a transcription factor and its regulon remains unstudied. Our ongoing studies indicate that both AtcR
and Rrp2 may co-regulate the expression of genes with the alternative sigma factor, s54. However, no study has
ever explored the role of s54 in T. denticola. The published literature supports our preliminary data suggesting
that AtcR likely contributes to community interactions with P. gingivalis, and both AtcR and Rrp2 likely impact the
fitness and virulence of T. denticola. Here, we propose three complementary Specific Aims that will fill these gaps
in knowledge. Aim 1 will determine how phosphorylation of AtcR impacts DNA binding kinetic, affinity, and
stoichiometry, while knockout of atcR in T. denticola will characterize the role of AtcR in gene regulation and
physiology. Aim 2 will define the Rrp2 and s54 binding sites, demonstrate Rrp2 interacts with s54 to regulate gene
expression and determine if Rrp2-mediated regulation responds to changes in environmental oxygen. Aim 3 will
determine if AtcR and Rrp2 contribute to T. denticola colonization of the gingiva, induction of inflammatory
markers, and alveolar bone loss in murine models of periodontitis. We will then determine if AtcR contributes to
synergistic growth and pathogenicity with P. gingivalis. Completing this study will define half of the sensory
transduction systems of T. denticola and elucidate the complex genetic regulatory mechanisms that allow for T.
denticola to be a successful periodontal pathogen."
10858775,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 This research proposal aims to develop advanced in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies
for studying infant brain development. The objective is to achieve motion-robust, high-resolution (600µm isotropic)
whole-brain quantitative MRI (qMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) within a clinically feasible scan time. By improving
image resolution and quality, we can better understand the microstructural changes in cortex and superficial
white matter during infancy. Specifically, the development of myelin, a crucial indicator of brain development, will
be assessed using qMRI and dMRI techniques such as myelin water fraction mapping (MWF), longitudinal
relaxation time T1, transverse relaxation time T2, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). These
techniques provide valuable information about tissue properties, contributing to a comprehensive understanding
of early brain development.
 Increasing the spatial resolution of qMRI and dMRI is crucial for accurately studying myelination and tracking
developmental trajectories. However, current image resolutions in large-scale clinical and research studies
typically range from 1.0 to 2.0mm, leading to partial volume effects and potential inaccuracies in assessing myelin
content. Overcoming challenges such as long scan times, motion sensitivity, and decreased signal-to-noise ratio
is essential for increasing image resolution in infant brain development studies.
 To address these challenges, this grant proposes three specific aims. Aim 1 focuses on developing
acquisition and reconstruction strategies for 600µm whole-brain multi-parametric qMRI. This includes the use of
our proposed ViSTa-MRF sequence for simultaneous MWF, T1, and T2 mapping, as well as motion-robust
subspace reconstruction for improved identification of myelin components. Aim 2 aims to develop acquisition
and reconstruction strategies for high-fidelity whole-brain mesoscale dMRI, incorporating techniques such as
simultaneous multi-slab gSlider encoding and blipped-up/-down circular-EPI acquisition. Motion-robust dMRI
approaches will also be developed to mitigate head motion and correct image distortions. Aim 3 involves
translating the developed qMRI and dMRI techniques for infant brain development by establishing a protocol
using a home-built baby coil and validating the techniques through ex-vivo and in-vivo measurements.
Longitudinal assessment of the visual cortex and superficial white matter will be conducted to validate
developmental variations, explore the association between microstructural development and tissue proliferation,
and investigate myelination and U-fibers.
 Overall, this proposal leverages expertise in MRI technology development, data acquisition, reconstruction,
and analysis to advance our understanding of infant brain development. By enhancing the capabilities of qMRI
and dMRI, we can gain valuable insights into the intricate processes of early brain development."
10858781,"Concerns about deteriorating mental health, substance use disorders, early development of
chronic conditions, exposure to economic shocks, and to violence---causes that may all lead to
premature mortality among adolescents and young adults in the United States, have been rising
in recent public discourse. Despite these concerns, and the importance of this age group for the
society’s future well-being, research on the trends, variation, and above all distal causes of
mortality in this age group has been limited when compared to evidence on the causes and
consequences of mortality among infants and older adults. This dearth of evidence likely stems
from the absence of data sets with wide population coverage for this age group that links
mortality—a very rare outcome—with anything beyond the basic demographic information about
the individuals. In this project, we propose to take advantage of extensive infrastructure for
linking US administrative data that has been developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, to construct
a new database that links administrative birth and death dates for 10 to 25 year olds, with data
on their demographics (race, ethnicity, sex, age, disability status), education, familial
circumstances, parental income, access to public health insurance, healthcare providers, and
local geographies, covering the time period from 2005 to the 2025. Using this new database, we
will document how youth mortality evolved over time and space in the Unites States. We will
also describe mortality inequalities across different subpopulations based on a rich set of
demographic and socio-economic characteristics of adolescents, young adults, their families,
and communities. Finally, we aim to use natural experiments and statistical techniques of causal
inference to improve our understanding of the underlying distal causes of observed mortality
patterns."
10831053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of severe vision loss in the working-age
population in the world. However, clinical studies have shown that approximately 40% DR patients do not
adequately respond to anti-VEGF drugs. There is no drug treatment for those 40% DR patients. Furthermore,
repeated bolus injections of these anti-VEGF agents are associated with risks of injection-associated side
effects, and are a big burden to patients and the healthcare system. Fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor-α (PPARα) agonist, is the first low-cost and safe oral drug for DR with clinically proven
efficacy against retinal neovascularization and diabetic macular edema in diabetic patients. However, oral
fenofibrate has a short half-life and poor retinal absorption. An ocular fenofibrate delivery is needed for the
treatment of DR. Intravitreal injection (IVT) of fenofibrate free drug demonstrated a short half-life of the drug in
the eye, and frequent IVT injections of fenofibrate are needed to sustain the effect. We propose a new drug
delivery strategy for providing sustained intraocular fenofibrate to target a non-VEGF, PPARα pathway and
reducing the treatment burden from DR patients. Recently, we developed small-sized 200nm biodegradable
nanoparticles containing 6% fenofibrate (Feno-NP) that demonstrated drug release for at least 8 weeks in the
eye following an IVT injection, and have no detectable ocular toxicities. Our preliminary results further
demonstrated that a single IVT injection of Feno-NP was effective on DR in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced
T1D rat model for 8 weeks. Here, our aim is to develop and optimize new longer-lasting large-sized fenofibrate-
loaded microparticles (Feno-MP) that have higher drug loadings (≥20%) with dense PEG coating, and can
safely and effectively treat DR, for ≥ 6 months with a single IVT injection. If successful, this approach would
significantly improve DR patient care. In Aim 1, we will optimize and characterize reproducible large-sized
Feno-MP formulations that release fenofibrate for ≥6 months, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and
assess ocular pharmacokinetics (PK). The two most promising Feno-MP formulations will then be tested for
dose dependent efficacy on retinal vascular leakage and inflammation in STZ-induced diabetic rats (T1D
model) and db/db mice (T2D model) in Aim 2. Finally, we will carry out detailed safety and ocular PK studies of
one lead Feno-MP formulation in rabbits in Aim 3 to facilitate future development and potential clinical
translation."

10854083,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adoptive cellular immunotherapies are an established therapeutic weapon in the fight against cancer. However,
there is a large variability in anti-tumor responses and toxicity between patients, due primarily to differences in
immune cell trafficking to tumor and lymph tissues. This has urged the development of surveillance tools that
can monitor adoptive immune cell tissue migration in vivo to inform treatment regimens, empower interpretation
of therapeutic outcomes, and aid in the early detection of adverse events. To address this technologic need, our
goal is to develop nano-scale contrast agents that enable continuous and high-fidelity ultrasound (US) imaging
of immune cells in deep tissues, employing tumoricidal chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-M) as an
exemplary cellular model. Fundamental to this strategy is our development of phase-changing peptide
nanoemulsions (NPep) that are rapidly internalized and persist within macrophages for multiple days and can
generate echogenic bubble imaging nuclei on-demand without compromising cell viability. Our recent studies
show these capabilities allow NPeps to provide real-time and long-term monitoring of macrophages in tissues
using diagnostic B-mode and Doppler US imaging. Additional studies demonstrate NPeps provide a distinctive
Doppler ‘twinkling’ feature that permits unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution of contrast-enhanced features
from the tissue background to improve imaging resolution and identification of cellular locale. Bringing together
a multi-disciplinary team of materials scientists, ultrasound imaging experts, and immunologists, our objective is
to rationally tune NPep design to improve Doppler twinkling in cells (Aim 1), controllably modulate macrophage
behavior in situ via US release of immunostimulants loaded into the NPep carrier (Aim 2), and demonstrate non-
invasive, real-time, high contrast, and continuous imaging of NPep-labeled CAR-M intratumoral migration and
persistence in vivo (Aim 3). To achieve this, in aim 1 we perform multiplexed imaging of NPep formulations with
varying emulsion size and surface tension, two parameters linked to particle US response, to establish design
rules that can be used to improve the consistency, power, and duration of NPep Doppler twinkling. Aim 2 will
evaluate changes in macrophage viability, phenotype, and phagocytic function after uptake of NPep contrast
agents, as well as demonstrate our ability to productively modulate anti-tumor behavior via US-actuated
intracellular release of a loaded PPARγ agonist demonstrated to stimulate tumoricidal responses. In aim 3, we
evaluate the potential of this tool to provide real-time and long-term monitoring of adoptive CAR-M infiltration into
xenograft neuroblastoma tumors, as an exemplary in vivo model, using standard diagnostic US imaging
modalities. Collectively, this work will provide the foundation for a clinically relevant tool that can be broadly
adopted by the oncology community for real-time deep tissue imaging of adoptive cellular immunotherapies."

significant scientific contributions to 4 HSR&D research priority areas: Access to Care, Health Care Value,
Primary Care Practice and Complex Chronic Disease Management, and Virtual Care/Telehealth.
Innovation & Impact: The Advancing Decisions about Virtual Service Encounters (ADViSE) intervention will
be the first to deliver personalized, interactive information about the potential value of different Primary Care
encounter modalities to patients and PCPs. Our team will also be among the first to use the new VA Patient
Engagement, Tracking, and Long-term Support (PETALS) platform in patient-oriented research. Additionally,
our research will significantly advance the science of decision-making about healthcare options and thus will
have major impact in settings beyond VHA Primary Care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess the perceived benefits and optimal uses of different Primary Care encounter
modalities for Veterans with different needs and preferences. Aim 2: Optimize the usability and functionality of
the ADViSE intervention for delivering personalized, interactive information about the value of different Primary
Care encounter modalities to Veterans and clinicians. Aim 3: Test the impact of the optimized ADViSE
intervention on Veteran-centered outcomes, use of virtual care, and intermediate health outcomes.
Methodology: We will use surveys of Veterans, semi-structured interviews of Veterans, and chart-stimulated
recall interviews of VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS) PCPs to assess perceived benefits and
optimal uses of different Primary Care visit modalities. This information will be used to develop Veteran-facing
and PCP-facing messages that will be tailored to Veterans’ modality preferences and target key determinants
of informed decision-making about Primary Care encounter modalities. These new messages will be combined
with our pilot-tested
system for generating and communicating personalized estimates of the copay, travel, and
time costs for different Primary Care encounter modalities. In this novel ADViSE intervention, interactive
d
ecision support will be delivered to Veterans by text messaging through the PETALS platform and to PCPs by
Microsoft Teams and brief coaching. We will then conduct brief iterative user-centered optimization of a
condensed version of the ADViSE intervention. Finally, we will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized
controlled trial in the VAAAHS to evaluate effects of the fully optimized ADViSE intervention on
Veterans’
perceived value of their healthcare (primary outcome); satisfaction with care; copay, travel, and time costs;
preferences for virtual care; use of virtual care; and key electronic quality measures (secondary outcomes).
Next Steps/Implementation: We will engage key national and local VA operational stakeholders on our
National Advisory Committee (NAC) throughout the study to optimize sustainability and rapidly disseminate
study products and findings. If the ADViSE intervention is found to be effective, we will work closely with our
NAC to explore implementation opportunities and pursue an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design trial to
evaluate effects and implementation of the ADViSE intervention in other VHA settings."

The larynx requires protection from the ~25 million inhaled insults encountered daily during fulfillment of its
normal functions including breathing, coughing, swallowing, and in humans, voice production. An epithelium
forms a critical first protective barrier on the surface of the larynx. Under normal conditions, the epithelium
relies on homeostatic regenerative mechanisms. The basal cell (BC) layer of the epithelium is believed to
represent a reservoir of progenitor cells for the formation and regeneration of differentiated epithelium.
However, pathological changes, or remodeling, occurs in the composition and organization of the laryngeal
epithelium in response to inhaled insults, notably cigarette smoke (CS). Remodeling affects the ability of the
epithelium to function as an effective barrier and predisposes the tissue to disease development. Despite the
prevalence and likely importance of epithelial remodeling in CS-induced laryngeal disease, its etiology is poorly
understood. This is due to a lack of basic knowledge of the mechanisms which dictate laryngeal epithelial
homeostatic regeneration and permanent tissue remodeling linked to CS. Specifically, little is known about the
biology of the BC population in normal epithelial homeostasis, injured, or diseased conditions. A paucity of
research on laryngeal BC biology serves as a major barrier in the development of therapies to prevent and
treat CS-diseased vocal folds. To address this unmet need, we propose to test the central hypothesis that BC
are critical to the formation and maintenance of normal laryngeal epithelium and CS-induced alterations in BC
biology are associated with epithelial remodeling and human disease development. We will test this hypothesis
using a normal mouse model (AIM 1) and in vivo and in vitro models of CS exposure (AIM 2) to study laryngeal
BC properties in differentiated epithelium, primary culture, and physiologically relevant three-dimensional
epithelial cell culture systems. We also propose to evaluate how our in vivo and in vitro findings in mice relate
to the human condition by evaluating the biology of BC in human laryngeal specimens from patients with
Reinke’s edema, a common CS-induced laryngeal disease (AIM 3). Completion of these aims will demonstrate
that BC have a central and irreplaceable role in laryngeal epithelial biology- they function as progenitor cells for
normal epithelium and alterations in BC biology are implicated in disease development. Findings will have
significant theoretical and clinical impact and will provide novel new insights into the mechanism underlying
laryngeal and vocal fold epithelial regeneration. Targeting specific biologic pathways that mediate CS-induced
derangements in BC biology may represent innovative therapeutic targets to prevent development and
progression of CS- and other smoke-mediated voice disorders."
10845684,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The NCTN's Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) and its associated biorepositories represent
an unequaled resource of expertise, institutional infrastructure, and high quality, densely annotated patient
biospecimens collected from several decades of cancer therapeutic trials. The scientific mission of the
Alliance Biorepository and Biospecimen Resource (ABBR) is to support the activities of the Alliance, the
NCTN, and the broader cancer research community through four specific aims, which are: 1) To
prospectively support Alliance and NCTN-wide clinical cancer trials with respect to biospecimen
procurement, tracking, processing, quality assurance, storage, and distribution. The ABBR implements a
number of innovative approaches to streamline biospecimen collection and support the collection of novel
biospecimen types for genomic, proteomic, immunoncology, and `liquid biopsy' biomarker studies in the
context of therapeutic trials; 2) To provide a resource of high quality, densely annotated biospecimens for
secondary correlative science studies directed toward biomarker validation with high clinical impact. The
ABBR cooperates with other NCTN biorepositories, the NCTN Biospecimen `Front Door Service', and the
NCTN Navigator tool to provide inventories of biospecimens that may be suitable for secondary correlative
science studies proposed both within the NCTN groups as well as the broader cancer research community.
It also works with other NCTN members and NCI to create an efficient and transparent process for
reviewing, approving, and executing such requests so as to speed the translation of candidate biomarkers
to cancer diagnostics with clinical utility; 3) To provide scientific leadership to the NCTN biobanking
enterprise, by active participation in the NCTN Group Banking Committee (GBC). The ABBR will continue
its outstanding commitment to harmonizing and improving biobanking Best Practices by active participation
in GBC meetings, subcommittees activities, and work products, and; 4) To provide expertise and
infrastructure support for biobanking efforts aligned with and beyond the NCTN, including the Cancer and
Immune Monitoring Analysis Centers (CIMACs) and the Community Oncology Research Program
(NCORP). Having created a federated infrastructure of biorepository sites and a unifying informatics
platform for tracking biospecimens across them, the ABBR continues to be uniquely poised to collaborate
with other NCI programs, whenever biorepository or biospecimen resources are required for specific
translational cancer research efforts."
10845685,"In response to this IRCN FOA, in this application we have combined our experience of two decades in
understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) with molecular and functional imaging, and our experience
of a decade in developing theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) that deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA), to
understand the role of TME in siRNA NP delivery and function.
siRNA have emerged as promising candidates for precision medicine in cancer that becomes significantly
important for cancers such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that lack targeted treatments. Here we will
perform combined in vivo PET-MR imaging studies to relate siRNA NP delivery, as detected by PET imaging,
to vascular parameters, acidic extracellular pH (pHe), and extracellular matrix (ECM) porosity as detected by
MRI to understand the role of the TME in siRNA NP delivery and function. The dextran NP we selected is
biocompatible making it an excellent translational candidate; the siRNA we selected for delivery downregulates
choline kinase (Chk), an important target in cancer cells. Downregulation of Chk results in a decrease of total
choline that can be imaged with MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), allowing us to relate siRNA delivery to
function noninvasively. Both PET and MR are also easily translatable to humans.
We will integrate ex vivo mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy,
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of co-localized tumor sections to expand our understanding of the changes
mediated by the Chk siRNA on the proteome, lipidome and metabolome with MSI, and of the characteristics of
the ECM that play a role in NP delivery and distribution with SHG microscopy and IHC. These studies will be
performed with human TNBC xenografts genetically engineered to overexpress vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) or to report on hypoxia. The reagents, resources, tumor models and imaging technologies
developed through this application will be available to the Alliance awardees and for collaborations outside of
the current Alliance network to establish mutually beneficial collaborations. These studies have the potential to
provide future clinically translatable applications in achieving precision medicine of cancer."
10846033,"Abstract
Evaluating curative interventions in older people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is challenging due to the complex
interplay between HIV infection, aging, and age-related comorbidities. We have recently shown in 14 people with
HIV (PWH) receiving long-term ART that there are three patterns of intact proviral DNA decay: 1) a biphasic
decline with markedly slower second phase decline; 2) an initial decline followed by a zero-slope plateau; and
3) an initial decline followed by later increases in intact proviral DNA. In this study, the two participants who had
an increase in intact proviral DNA were females >60 years old and had been on ART for up to 20 years. This
important result raises the question whether age is associated with a slowing decay in intact proviral
DNA among PWH on long-term ART. Accordingly, we will extend these preliminary observations to a large
longitudinal cohort (ACTG A5321) of men and women with a median duration of ART of 14 years (IQR 12 – 17)
(range 5-24 years) and archived blood samples every six months. In addition, cellular senescence is also a factor
that could affect HIV persistence as people age. Senescent cells are in a state of cell-cycle arrest and acquire
the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) resulting in an inflammatory state. If this inflammatory
environment created by SASP leads to proliferation of HIV-infected cells, then senescent cells may play a role
in slowing or reversing the decay of intact proviruses. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that markers
of HIV persistence are more likely to slow their decline, or increase, with age on ART, in association with
increasing markers of immune senescence. To address this hypothesis, we will 1) assess the
longitudinal relationship between age/sex and the levels and trajectory of HIV-1 reservoirs on ART, and
2) determine the longitudinal relationships between the levels and trajectory of HIV persistence markers
and SASP markers. The duration of ART in this ACTG A5321 cohort is much longer than in many other studies
as participants have been in continuous follow-up since initiation of ART and have well-documented virologic
suppression for approximately 20 years with detailed clinical, laboratory, reservoir data and additional blood
samples from immediately pre-ART through the present day. We will evaluate 100 A5321 participants over
multiple timepoints for levels of intact proviral DNA, total DNA, residual HIV-1 RNA using the single copy assay
and assess the relationships between levels of these persistence markers and age/sex. In a subset of 25
participants, we will perform bulk integration site analysis to determine the clonality of cells carrying proviruses
as a function of age. We will also measure a panel of SASP markers using a multiplex platform using samples
from the 100 participants in Aim 1 to assess whether the measures of HIV persistence in Aim 1 are associated
with the markers of senescence."
10846781,"Summary – Mathematical Modeling Core
HIV infection remains an important public health problem. Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) can
control the infection, but lifelong ART is challenging and is encumbered by long-term adverse drug
effects. The major challenge to eradicating HIV-1 is the existence of the long-lived latent HIV-1 resevoir.
While reservoir eradication is the ultimate goal, to achieve that goal we need greater understanding of
the factors underlying the establishment of the reservoir, the composition of the reservoir, the dynamics
of the reservoir and if there are specific properties of reservoir cells that could be exploited to enhance
their elimination. Following the initiation of ART, the amount of virus in the blood drops dramatically.
This is due to the fact that most infected cells die very quickly, and when new infection events are
blocked by ART, this decay becomes apparent. However, not all of the infected cells die; some survive
and may become part of the stable latent reservoir. This research program will study these decay
processes using precise quantitative assays and single cell techniques in hope of understanding
whether the decay represents a selection process that shapes the composition of the latent reservoir.
The Modeling Core will develop mathematical models to explain these decay processes and how they
are related to the dynamics of the latent reservoir. The Core will also provide expertise in experimental
design and analysis of experimental results. We hope that this collaborative, quantitative approach will
lead to a better understanding of how the reservoir forms and persists and to novel cure strategies."

This project serves as the ligand development component of a comprehensive collaborative effort to
fundamentally expand our understanding of the selective and functional modulation of the two
cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. During the current funding period, we have made substantial progress in
exploring the functional and structural properties of CB1 and CB2 through the development of suitable
irreversible novel ligands. These have been used to obtain structural and functional information on CB1 and
CB2 through our Ligand Assisted Protein Structure (LAPS) approach. Results originating from LAPS were
further refined with the assistance of CB1 and CB2 X-ray and cryo-EM structures in complex with our high-affinity
ligands. Based on our early work we were successful in developing neutral CB1 receptor antagonists that are
being tested as potential medications for alcohol and opioid addiction (centrally active) as well as for pulmonary,
liver and kidney fibrotic conditions (peripherally active). We have made advances towards the goals of the
current cycle by distinguishing structural features of functional selectivity and developing functionally
selective ligands. Additionally, we have identified novel approaches for developing ligands with distinct
pharmacological profiles. These are now being integrated into our current submission. This project will provide
the basis for the development of ligands that are involved in the preferential modulation of CB1 and the
selective activation of CB2. We propose to accomplish our goals with the following specific aims: The first
aim encompasses the development of a) orthosteric agonists exhibiting functional selectivity for CB1 and b) CB1
positive allosteric modulators with irreversible binding characteristics. The second aim encompasses the
development of a) CB2 agonists with no or minimal efficacy for CB1 and b) bifunctional ligands that behave as
CB2 agonists/CB1 antagonists (Yin-Yang). The results and ligands produced under the auspices of this project
will serve as a basis for the development of novel medications with improved pharmacological profiles for
the treatment of addictive, inflammatory and fibrotic disorders."
10846848,"Project Summary
The therapeutic potential of the endocannabinoid system has yet to translate into safe and effective
medicines. The translation gap, or “valley of death” separates promising preclinical research from
identification of a newly approved drug. Functional selectivity (or biased agonism) is a recently appreciated
property of CB1 and CB2 receptor signalling. Challenges for clinical translation include the question of what
signalling pathway best predicts therapeutic efficacy. It is, therefore, necessary to establish that candidate
ligands engage the specific signalling pathways necessary for therapeutic benefit, while, ideally,
circumventing those pathways responsible for unwanted side effects. Both biased agonism and allosteric
modulation represent alternative strategies to harness the therapeutic potential of the endocannabinoid
signalling system without the unwanted effects of direct acting CB1 agonists. The signalling pathways
necessary and dispensable for CB1 and CB2 therapeutic efficacy remain poorly understood. Bridging this
gap in knowledge is critical if we are to avoid costly failures in clinical translation. Project 3 will use novel CB1
and CB2 probes that are developed in Project 1 and characterized in vitro in Project 2 to elucidate how CB1
biased agonism, probe specific CB1 positive allosteric modulation and CB2 selective agonism impact in vivo
pharmacology. Aim 1 will define the in vivo pharmacology of functionally selective CB1 probes. We will profile
functionally selective CB1 agonists as well as tight binding (slow Koff) and probe-specific CB1 PAMs (that
exhibit high potency in our preliminary in vivo studies) for cardinal signs of CB1 activation, ability to suppress
neuropathic nociception as well as propensity to induce tolerance and physical dependence. Aim 2 will define
the in vivo pharmacology of CB2 agonists with improved selectivity for CB2 over CB1. We will ascertain
whether in vivo pharmacological profiles and selectivity can be improved by incorporating high affinity CB2
agonism with a lack of CB1 agonism. We will also determine whether in vivo pharmacological profiles can be
enhanced by incorporating CB1 antagonism (neutral, inverse agonism, partial agonism) with high affinity CB2
agonism. This Aim will compare a spectrum of ligands exhibiting these properties for cannabimimetic effects,
anti-allodynic efficacy and tolerance, as well as capacity to induce physical dependence and negative
affective states. This project will validate improved CB1 and CB2 probes, not to develop a medication.
Elucidation of signalling pathways necessary and dispensable for in vivo efficacy and unwanted side effects
will improve cannabinoid-based therapeutics and break down barriers to successful clinical translation."

b) managing the fiscal aspects of the PPG, maintain financial records and other administrative functions; and c)
promptly and properly distributing or coordinating the distribution of materials (novel ligands; other ligands
developed in the PI’s laboratory; receptor mutants) produced under the auspices of Core B and the individual
Projects (1, ,2, and 3). The Administrative Core also takes responsibility for synchronizing the operations and
communications between the individual laboratories involved in the PPG and other laboratories which interact
collaboratively at no cost to the project. This effort includes recording and distributing materials produced to the
participant laboratories and to the collaborating laboratories, together with maintaining and updating the
database related to this multidisciplinary collaborative effort. Additional specific coordinating efforts include
maintaining regular telephone conferences, the yearly group meeting of participants and collaborators, as well
as other communications and the quarterly meetings with the Internal Advisory Committee, as well as the yearly
formal meeting with the External Scientific Advisory Committee. The Administrative Core will manage the shared

The impact of cellular metabolism on drug susceptibility has been observed in a wide range of organisms and
cell types. However, how metabolism influences the activity of diverse classes of drugs has not been
systematically explored. Linking metabolism and drug sensitivity has been a challenge due to both the impact
of metabolism on numerous cellular processes, and the complexity of drug response. To address this, a
combination of cutting-edge experimental and computational systems-biology tools will be applied to dissect
the mechanisms by which cellular metabolism impacts the activity of drugs. The overall goal of my lab is to
develop systems biology algorithms to reconstruct metabolic regulation and harness it for drug discovery. Here
we propose to develop a new approach to link metabolism with various cellular process, called the ‘metabolic
influence network’. We will use it to predict the impact of metabolic activity of a cell on drugs that inhibit diverse
cellular processes. This framework will be applied to E. coli, yeast and human cell lines, allowing us to uncover
conserved principles linking metabolism with potency of drugs that target cellular processes such as
replication, transcription or signaling. This approach will be tested experimentally by altering cellular metabolic
state and drug sensitivity with nutrient screens, enzyme inhibitors and drug combinations. Our systems
approach will allow us to quantify the myriad effects of cell metabolism on drug action, including uptake,
collateral interactions, and efflux. Ultimately, this research program can help precision medicine efforts by
matching therapy based on cellular metabolic activity and the in vivo metabolic environment."

Sepsis is a critical clinical condition that is caused by dysregulated host immune response to infection and
characterized by organ failure and high mortality. Sepsis is associated with marked inflammation and
hemostatic activation that often leads to widespread microvascular thrombus formation and global clotting
dysfunction, a complication termed sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate
immune receptors that respond to pathogen (PAMPs) or host-derived danger molecules (DAMPs) and drive
profound inflammation. We have established a murine model of SIC characterized by time-dependent
thrombocytopenia, procoagulant consumption, and global clotting dysfunction, and identified a critical role
for TLR7 (a receptor for single-stranded RNAs, e.g., HIV RNA or microRNA) in the pathogenesis of SIC
including thrombocytopenia, procoagulant (e.g., tissue factor, TF) production, and global clotting
dysfunction. Moreover, we have observed increased circulating plasma miRNAs (e.g., miR-146a-5p) and
extracellular vesicles (EVs, miRNA carrier) in sepsis, and a close correlation between the plasma RNA
levels and sepsis severity. Both miR-146a-5p and septic plasma EVs induce proinflammatory and
procoagulant response via a TLR7-dependent manner. Based on these data and the literature, we
hypothesize that miRNA→TLR7 signaling plays an important role in regulating platelet activity and contributes
to platelet dysfunction in SIC. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three Specific Aims. In Aim
1, we will test the function and mechanisms of miRNA-TLR7 signaling in platelet activation. In Aim 2, we
will determine the effect of EVs loaded with miR-146a-5p and septic plasma EVs on platelet activation and
function. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of TLR7 signaling in platelet activation and dysfunction in SIC.
Completion of the proposed studies will provide new insight into the role and mechanism of miRNA-TLR7
signaling in regulating platelet activity and dysfunction in SIC, and potentially offer a novel therapeutic target."
10846752,"The ability to deliver pathogen-resistance genes into mosquito populations has long been
sought as a potential alternative for disrupting dengue or malaria transmission where funds and
infrastructure are the limiting factors in effective mosquito control. The recent development of
effective gene drive transgenes based on CRISPR/Cas9 has largely solved the technical
challenges of achieving super-Mendelian introgression, however there exists no means to
control or recall such genetic elements once released making safety testing in the relevant
environments problematic. Drosophila melanogaster is an extremely trackable genetic model
organism, while Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya
viruses, as well as a model system for studies of other mosquitoes. In this project, we will
employ both D. melanogaster and A. aegypti to evaluate a transgene self-elimination strategy
whereby a transgene can be pre-programmed to first drive itself into a population and then
remove itself from the population without any intervention from the experimenter. We will
characterize some of the limiting parameters of the self-elimination system, such as direct
repeat length (Aim 1) and number and type of nuclease targeting sites (Aim 2). Finally, we will
test this self-elimination strategy in the context of an active gene drive in both flies and
mosquitoes (Aim 3). Our innovative approach takes advantage of naturally occurring processes
that are conserved throughout eukaryota to completely eliminate all transgenic sequences
following potential field releases. Thus, we anticipate that this project will dramatically alter the
National and International conversations concerning gene drive technology as a whole, and will
raise expectations for what is possible in any future trial to generate pathogen-resistant

HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) mediate viral entry into host cells and are the sole target of neutralizing
antibodies. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) target highly conserved sites on HIV-1 Envs and neutralize
a wide range of diverse strains from different clades. Nevertheless, bnAb immunotherapy aiming to suppress
HIV-1 replication sometimes leads to development of bnAb-resistant HIV-1 strains, and HIV-1 strains with pre-
existing bnAb resistance can be identified by prescreening before treatment. Thus, understanding the underlying
mechanisms of bnAb resistance are critical for the future application of bnAbs for immunotherapy and prevention.
Mechanisms that lead to multi-bnAbs resistance and indirect mechanisms that facilitate escape of bnAbs from
different groups are of particular public health concern.
Our study is structured to provide important insights into bnAb resistance at different levels. In Specific Aim 1 we
will study direct resistance mechanisms of rebounded HIV-1 strains that are resistant to multiple bnAbs. We will
screen samples from clinical studies of bnAb therapy, identify Envs of HIV-1 strains that exhibit the highest
degree of resistance to several bnAbs, study Env sequence, function, glycosylation patterns and determine the
structures of resistant Envs at atomic level resolution. Our comprehensive approach will provide unique profiles
of selected multi-bnAb resistant Envs that integrate all potential mechanisms contributing to bnAb resistance. In
a parallel direction, we will study the ability of rebounded HIV-1 strains to spread through cell-cell transmission,
which allows efficient viral replication in the presence of different groups of bnAbs. We will test the hypothesis
that bnAb-sensitive HIV-1 strains that replicate despite high levels of bnAb in the serum of participants from the
RV397 trial can efficiently spread by cell-cell transmission. Additionally, we will investigate the molecular
mechanisms of strains that exhibit increased cell-cell transmission efficiency and bnAb resistance. In Specific
Aim 2 we will define optimal bnAb combinations to overcome bnAb resistance and use antibody yeast display
technology to bioengineer recombinant bnAbs with improved affinity against bnAb-sensitive and resistant HIV-1
strains. This approach will allow us to confirm mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs and to test the
hypothesis that specific changes in bnAbs can improve bnAb breadth and allow targeting of a subset of resistant
HIV-1 strains.
Overall, our study will provide high-resolution and comprehensive view on multi-bnAb resistant HIV-1 Envs, on
alternative pathways of HIV-1 resistance in vivo, and on potential approaches to overcome bnAb resistance. Our
results will form a strong basis for the development of new strategies for HIV-1 immunotherapy and prevention
efforts."

Stimulus responsive materials with dynamic mechanical properties and reporter functions hold great promise in
biomimicry, tissue engineering, disease models and delivery vehicles. On-demand stiffening hydrogel matrices,
for instance, allow for control over the lineage commitment of stem and progenitor cells as well as fabrication of
in vitro fibrosis models of heart, lung and liver. Similarly, gradual softening of the matrices enables the
investigation of anti-fibrotic cell responses, matrix remodeling and resolution of the disease states. Responsive
matrices also find use as cell nanocoating to bring mammalian cells to a bionic state and provide cytoprotection
under harsh conditions during 3D bioprinting and injection-based cell transplantation. Yet, the challenge of
combining tunable stimulus responsiveness, mechanics, bioactivity, and degradation for optimal cell-matrix
interactions and host responses remain a challenge. In the current TRD1, we studied composites of silk protein
with other biopolymers such as gelatin, alginate and hyaluronic acid involving their chemical modification for
responsiveness, tunable mechanics and degradation rates. These materials were utilized as cytoprotective
capsules for mammalian cells against hydrodynamic forces during capillary flow as well as for gel systems with
reporter functions for oxygen levels. The renewal of TRD1 will focus on translation of these material formats into
in vitro and in vivo practices. These directions will include: (a) scaffold materials for engineering specific tissues
and disease states such as fibrosis, (b) preservation of cell viability and function during 3D printing and injection-
based cell delivery, and (c) reporter matrices in the form of subcutaneous tattoos or microneedles for real time
monitoring of physiological conditions. The overall goal is to adjust the reversible chemistry and dynamic
mechanics of the matrices developed in current TRD1 for specific applications in TRD2 and TRD3. We plan to
use a range of human cell lineages to test cell-material interactions and fabricate tissue models for in vitro
assessment of material function and properties. The outcomes from the renewal will be new approaches to
medical intervention for future clinical tests."

TR&D2 will continue to focus on the development of imaging enabled micro-scale bioreactors with optical
control and sensing and spatiotemporal visualization of biological events. These systems, containing one or
more tissues, are often called “organs-on-chip” because of their ability to recapitulate organ level functions,
such as liver metabolism or contractile function of the heart. Because of this ability to model human physiology
and disease, they overcome many of the limitations of current cell and animal models and are being considered
a fast-track opportunity for tissue engineering to advance drug development and precision medicine. In current
TERC, we have developed bioreactors with optical control and sensing and spatiotemporal visualization of
biological events, such as optogenetic control of cell differentiation to engineer stratified tissues. We also
established ability to maintain each tissue in its optimal niche while linking them to each other by vascular flow
to allow cross-talk. TERC renewal will leverage these advances to develop a cohesive approach to the design
of deployable imaging-enabled micro-scale bioreactors for broad use. As in current TERC, all tissues will be
derived from iPSCs, to allow patient specific and precision medicine studies. To advance biological fidelity of
these human tissue models, we will incorporate a bone marrow module to provide sustained supply of immune
cells, which play major roles in many diseases. In Aim 1, we will establish a configurable plug-and-play platform
with several different modalities for real-time imaging and feedback control, as a foundational technology for
studying human pathophysiology, in the context of both individual organ studies (TR&D2 Aim 2 and Aim 3) and
systemic conditions (TR&D3 Aim 2). To demonstrate broad utility for studies of disease, injury and regeneration,
we will address two major challenges in the field: generation of electromechanically active tissues (Aim 2:
cardiac -bone marrow bioreactor) and appropriate zoning and responses to physiologic loads (Aim 3: synovial

10843831,"Title: Crosstalk between innate-immunity human microglia and adaptive-immunity Tregs in Alzheimer’s
disease (RFA-AG-22-017)
Project Summary
This application is in response to RFA-AG-22-017, looking at crosstalk between innate and acquired
immunity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD affects ~5% of people over age 65, and its prevalence is
increasing. Neuroinflammation has been described in neurodegenerative disorders, and particularly in AD.
Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), respond to different pro-
inflammatory stimuli by releasing glutamate, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Glutamate
release from astrocytes and microglia has also been observed after exposure to Aβ and to αSyn, proteins that
are misfolded in AD. T lymphocytes, express several NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), and we
have also detected their expression in Tregs, whose activity can reportedly ameliorate neurodegenerative
disorders. Using patch-clamp recording, our Preliminary Studies show for the first time the presence of
functional NMDAR-operated ion channels on human Tregs. Glutamate is known to affect T cell migration and
activation; however, the effect of glutamate on Treg migration/activation has not been reported, and,
specifically, it is not known how this might impact neurons in AD brain.
We hypothesize that glutamate exposure of Tregs will limit their release of anti-inflammatory and
neuroprotective factors, thus contributing to neuronal synaptic damage and cell loss. This crosstalk between
the innate and acquired immune system may represent a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of AD. We
have recently developed a protocol for generating human iPSC-derived microglia (hiMG) following a yolk sac
differentiation method (brain microglia originate from the yolk sac and not from the bone marrow). We will test
our hypothesis using a platform of hiPSC-derived microglia (hiMG), human Tregs (isolated from normal blood
donors), and hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons (hiN) bearing AD mutations (vs. their isogenic/gene-
corrected controls). Using this platform, we show in our Preliminary Studies that hiMG release glutamate
following activation with oligomeric Aβ and αSyn. We will systematically investigate the mechanism of the
activation of Tregs by glutamate released by hiMG, and the effect of this cellular crosstalk on neuronal
function. We will evaluate neuronal synaptic integrity and function as well as neuronal survival.
The knowledge gained from this study will shed light on the effect of glutamate on neuroinflammation in a
human context, and will provide insight into the effect of crosstalk between human microglial and Tregs in
stimulating Treg activation. Thus, the work may aid in the development of future novel therapeutic interventions
based on human microglial and Treg function and interaction."

In the past decade, Uganda seen increases – as large as 10-fold – in the number of people who use drugs
(PWUD) and the risk for HIV transmission through shared injection equipment, a common practice in this setting
with low access to clean equipment. HIV prevalence among PWUD has been estimated to be as high as
45%, highlighting the importance of widescale access to HIV treatment and prevention for PWUD,
including oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP was integrated into HIV prevention guidelines in
Uganda in 2016 and PEPFAR funding has been supporting targeted rollout to key populations, including PWUD.
However, <250 people currently accessing PrEP have identified as PWUD, indicating a large gap in prevention
and an opportunity to optimize PrEP delivery for PWUD. For PWUD living with HIV, antiretroviral treatment has
been integrated into medication assisted treatment (MAT) programs and needle and syringe exchange programs
(NSP), by leveraging providers who empathize with addiction and have experience combating stigma associated
with drug use. We hypothesize that a similar approach can be done for PrEP by integrating PrEP delivery
into MAT and NSP programs and we proposed a staged approach to conduct formative work and refine
two integrated programs (PrEP + MAT and PrEP + NSP), to pilot these programs and assess PrEP uptake,
retention, and adherence and to conduct costing research to directly inform policy guidance. Our work
will be conducted with attention to several constructs within the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research and grounded in a participatory approach with members of the largest harm reduction network, police
force, and PWUD in Uganda as project advisors. Specifically, we aim to: 1) conduct qualitative research to
explore preferences for HIV prevention services and willingness to use/prescribe PrEP among PWUD and
providers of a) oral PrEP and b) services for PWUD in Kampala, Uganda; 2) refine programs for community-
based NSP + PrEP and facility-based MAT + PrEP; 3) compare PrEP uptake, retention, and adherence when
PrEP is integrated into community-based NSP versus facility-based MAT to PWUD; and 4) estimate the
programmatic costs and conduct budget impact analysis for integrating PrEP into our MAT and NSP programs.
Impact. The proposed work will provide robust evidence about how to optimize integrated harm reduction and
PrEP delivery to PWUD in Uganda and similar settings. With direct engagement from members of the Ugandan
Ministry of Health on our investigative team, our findings will be immediately useful for policy guidelines and to
guide programmatic scale-up. This work will be relevant to the US and globally as a demonstration of co-located
harm reduction and HIV prevention services for PWUD and it will provide some of the first data on PrEP
adherence and retention among PWUD."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by glucose intolerance in pregnant women without
previously diagnosed diabetes. GDM affects up to 10% of all pregnancies, imposing a significant adverse
effect on the health of both mother and fetus. To date, the underlying mechanism of GDM remains elusive.
Pregnancy is commonly associated with insulin resistance in the mother, a physiological response that serves
to spare blood glucose supplies for the fetus. To overcome insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cells of pregnant
mothers release more insulin into the blood. Such an adaptive response, termed “β-cell compensation”, is
essential for maintaining normal blood glucose metabolism in pregnancies. In at-risk pregnant women, β-cells
fail to compensate for maternal insulin resistance, contributing to insulin insufficiency and GDM. Nonetheless,
how β-cells compensate for maternal insulin resistance during pregnancy and what causes β-cell failure in
GDM are poorly understood. To decipher the mechanism of β-cell compensation for pregnancy, we determined
gestational regulation of β-cell mass and function by FoxO1 - a key transcription factor that integrates insulin
signaling and nutritional cues to cell metabolism, survival, proliferation and differentiation. We found that β-cell
FoxO1 expression is markedly upregulated, coinciding with the physiological induction of β-cell compensation
in mice during pregnancy. Furthermore, we showed that β-cell FoxO1 deficiency predisposes pregnant female
mice to GDM, as evidenced by the induction of impaired glucose tolerance, elevated blood glucose levels and
reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during pregnancy. These new data underscore the importance of
FoxO1 in governing the adaptive changes of β-cell mass and function in response to pregnancy, spurring the
hypothesis that FoxO1 deregulation may be the missing link between maternal insulin resistance and β-cell
decompensation in GDM. To address this hypothesis, we will use rigorous in vivo and ex vivo studies to
characterize the role of FoxO1 in integrating gestational hormonal signaling to adaptive changes in β-cell mass
and function during pregnancy. We will determine the mechanism by which FoxO1 augments β-cell
compensation for maternal insulin resistance in female mice. Furthermore, we will determine the mechanism of
how β-cell FoxO1 deficiency causes β-cell decompensation, contributing to the development of GDM.
Accomplishing this project will deepen our understanding of gestational β-cell compensation for maternal
insulin resistance, providing new mechanistic insights into β-cell decompensation and GDM."
10843835,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral palsy (CP) results from a perinatal brain injury and is one of the most prevalent and costly pediatric
neurologic conditions in the United States that often results in mobility deficits. Our extensive experimental work
has been focused on developing a therapeutic gait training protocol that will improve the long-term mobility of
adolescents with CP. Despite our major breakthroughs, it is apparent across our investigations that some
adolescents have vast improvements in their mobility after treatment, while others are clearly non-responders.
This response variability represents one of the major Gordian knots in the treatment outcomes seen in
adolescents with CP. Over the past decade, we have begun to disentangle this knot through a series of influential
magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain imaging studies that have revealed that adolescents with CP have
aberrant sensorimotor cortical oscillations while planning their leg motor actions and perceiving somatosensory
feedback. Our preliminary work on the gait treatment outcomes and neuroimaging of the sensorimotor cortices
has positioned us to be on the leading-edge for addressing RFA-HD-20-005, which requests “studies to
understand the underlying mechanisms for responders and non-responders to current treatments”. Essentially,
we will address this call with a multimodal approach that blends our expertise in MEG brain imaging, MRI spinal
cord imaging, and assessments of the spinal cord interneuronal circuitry to probe the neurophysiological
differences in adolescents that are classified as responders and non-responders after therapeutic gait training.
The Specific Aims of this study will: (1) identify if responders and non-responders have differences in the
strength of the sensorimotor cortical oscillations involved in the planning and execution of a leg motor action, (2)
determine if responders and non-responders have differences in the neural synchrony within the somatosensory
cortices, following stimulation of the foot mechanoreceptors, and (3) decipher if responders and non-responders
have differences in the spinal cord microstructure and circuitry dynamics. Briefly, our study design consists of a
cohort of adolescents with CP that will initially undergo MEG brain imaging, MRI spinal cord imaging,
neurophysiological tests of the spinal cord interneuronal circuitry and clinical mobility assessments. After
completing the baseline tests, the adolescents will undergo our therapeutic gait training protocol. Upon
completion of the treatment program, the adolescents will repeat the same assessments that were completed at
baseline. Separation of the adolescents into responders and non-responders to treatment will be based on the
criteria for a clinically relevant change in the 10-meter walking speed test. The new data derived from this project
will provide unparalleled insight on the potential neurophysiological origins of the diverse mobility outcomes seen
in adolescents with CP after treatment. These insights will set-the-stage for future studies that will explore the
use of neuroscience-informed therapeutic approaches that are directed at breaking through the specific neuro-
physiological barriers that non-responding adolescents may face (i.e., motor planning, sensory perception)."

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It manifests with
leg pain, decreased walking distance, non-healing wounds and gangrene. About 1/3 of CLI patients don't
respond to standard therapy and ultimately undergo major limb amputation. This critical unmet need demands
a solution. CLI causes >105 major limb amputations in the USA per year. Our overarching goal is to develop a
novel limb-salvage therapy. Gene therapy is a promising option to induce therapeutic angiogenesis, increasing
blood flow in ischemic limbs for repair. This approach has raised a great deal of hope for `no-option' CLI patients.
However, previous gene therapy approaches using naked plasmids encoding angiogenic factors, such as
VEGF and FGF, failed to show substantial clinical benefits. Moreover, early adenovirus-mediated gene delivery
systems raised concerns over safety. Hence, more efforts for the identification of alternative effective
transgenes and safe/efficient delivery vectors are crucial. Success of gene therapy for CLI requires activation
and participation of endogenous healing mechanisms including recruitment/homing of stem/progenitor cells to
ischemic tissue. Enhanced recruitment/homing depends upon a `hospitable' tissue microenvironment that is
receptive of endogenous regenerative cells. Our previous research discovered that in ischemia, homing for
these critical repair cells relies on specific cell-cell interactions via a panel of adhesion molecules, including E-
selectin/ligand pairs. The levels of vascular E-selectin in the ischemic limb tissues is down-regulated. We
hypothesize that E-selectin is pivotal in the recruitment of stem/progenitor cells necessary for
neovascularization in ischemic tissues. E-selectin can serve as a docking site for endogenous stem/progenitor
cells to anchor. The resulting downstream cell-cell signaling cascades can increase angiogenesis and tissue
repair/regeneration. We have recently demonstrated feasibility, safety and superior efficacy of E-selectin/AAV-
based gene therapy for improving limb perfusion, increasing neovascularization, decreasing ischemia, reducing
gangrene, minimizing tissue damage, augmenting regeneration of the ischemic skeletal muscle, and extending
running capacity, in murine models. In the clinical setting, we believe that such biologic effects can increase
functional walking capacity and prevent limb loss. We thus propose to induce a supportive tissue
microenvironment by priming endothelial cells in capillaries and other ischemic limb-tissue cells with the
adhesion molecule, E-selectin, using a safe and efficient AAV2 vector. We will utilize a clinically relevant mouse
model of CLI – the footpad gangrene, to test this novel gene therapy. The objectives are to validate and optimize
the translational protocol for a future large-animal pre-clinical study and conduct the requisite IND-enabling
GLP/GMP animal research for a subsequent pilot human study. The development of this novel gene therapy
may ultimately eliminate the need for most amputations by accelerating therapeutic angiogenesis and tissue
regeneration, and promises to revolutionize the treatment for PAD/CLI patients."

10841774,"The Carlson Group applies the diverse tools of chemical biology to understand how bacteria harness their
limited genome to inhabit nearly every ecological niche on our planet. These “simple” single-celled organisms
are remarkable in their ability to respond to and survive in the presence of diverse environmental stressors. This
is largely accomplished through related but specialized proteins that are activated under disparate conditions.
With NIH support, the PI has been investigating two protein families that are crucial to a bacteria’s ability to
respond to its environment and maintain cell wall integrity, histidine kinases (HKs) and penicillin-binding proteins
(PBPs). The PBPs are required for cell wall construction and are the targets of b-lactams, the most used class
of antibiotics in the world. The HKs sense changes in the periplasmic space and transmit this information inside
of the cell, allowing bacteria to respond to fluctuating environments. The HKs are also important in infection and
antibiotic resistance. Clearly, a deeper understanding of when, where, and how the PBPs and HKs are
functionally differentiated and used to enable cell survival will be crucial in combating the rapidly approaching
“post-antibiotic era.” Chemical probes are an essential tool for the characterization of these differentiating factors.
 We have pioneered the development of activity-based probes (ABPs) for the PBP and HK families that
specifically label catalytically active enzymes, yielding a read-out of their functional state. These molecules are
required to investigate how functionally related proteins differ from one another in their catalytic activation,
substrate or ligand recognition, localization, and biomolecular interactions. The overall vision for this MIRA
project is to build on the PI’s foundation of results and leadership in this area and apply a chemical approach to
expand the understanding of these two enzyme families. We will achieve this vision by expanding our library of
PBP-selective ABPs and applying these chemical probes to investigation of the roles of these proteins in cell
growth and division, as well as adaptation to environmental perturbations. We will also optimize the chemical
probes and internalization agents needed to deliver ABPs into the bacterial cytoplasm, enabling global mapping
of HK activation upon exposure to stimuli. Finally, we will validate the HKs as viable targets for the development
of anti-virulence agents and adjuvants and optimize the potency of our lead compounds.
 Our combined expertise in chemical synthesis, ABPs, mass spectrometry-based -omics, biochemistry, and
microbiology make us uniquely qualified to untangle the web of apparent functional redundancy within these
enzyme families. We also have long-standing collaborators with expertise in the HKs and PBPs, as well as
methods critical to this project. The overall impact of this work will be a drastically increased and rigorously tested
understanding of cell wall biosynthesis and signal transduction in bacteria and a suite of freely accessible
research tools. Ultimately, the amassed knowledge and tools will enable us to understand and predict how a
signal is propagated into bacterial action and to hijack the involved proteins for disease treatment."

Neighborhoods are an important ecological context for child and adolescent development and a social
determinant of physical health, mental health, and school achievement. Research has begun to elucidate the
associations between neighborhood disadvantage and brain structure, function, and behavior in relation to
executive function (EF) emotion regulation (ER), and emotional processing which may contribute to these short-
and long- term differences in health and development. Nevertheless, there are no population-based studies that
have examined the relation between neighborhood disadvantage, and changes in neighborhood disadvantage,
with longitudinal changes in neurodevelopment to determine if differences widen, narrow, or remain stable during
adolescence, a potential sensitive period. Moreover, there has been limited consideration of how associations
may vary across the country, and thus if they are of widespread importance. In addition, neighborhood risk may
increase vulnerability to major stressors and disruptions in schooling, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.
These COVID-19 related changes have disproportionately impacted disadvantaged communities and may
exacerbate neighborhood-related differences in underlying neurodevelopmental systems. Finally, it is important
to understand resilience, and the modifiable contextual factors that may protect against both neighborhood
disadvantage and the impact of COVID-19. This proposal will use the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive
Development (ABCD) Study, an ongoing longitudinal study that is uniquely suited to address these questions.
The ABCD Study enrolled a diverse cohort of 9-10-year-old children (n = 11,878) across 21 U.S. sites, contains
multimodal measures of neurodevelopment for EF, ER, and emotional processing and rich measures of family,
school, and neighborhood contexts, as well integrated rapid measurement of COVID-19 related impacts. This
study will capitalize on the staggered timing of the pandemic onset in the ABCD cohort, which occurred between
varying waves of data collection across participants. This creates a quasi-experimental design with the study
separated into a pre-pandemic and post-pandemic onset phase. In the pre-pandemic phase, we will determine
the association between neighborhood disadvantage, and neighborhood change, with longitudinal change in
brain and behavioral development (Aim 1). Second, we will examine if the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated
stressors and school disruptions, are associated with brain and behavior change, and exacerbate neighborhood
related differences, with pre-pandemic measures serving as controls for post-COVID-19 measures. (Aim 2).
Finally, we will elucidate the modifiable family, community and school factors that serve as moderators and foster
resilience (Aim 3). This study will thus identify potential neurodevelopmental pathways related to neighborhood
disadvantage and COVID-19, and identify modifiable contextual factors that are potential targets for policy and
programmatic interventions to ameliorate disparities in health and well-being, and the disparate impact of
COVID-19, while informing prevention strategies for subsequent pandemics or disasters."

 Recent innovations by project investigators have established an important new framework for the rapid
and scalable production of engineered living blood vessels. Notably, we have designed new protocols for
multiplex genome editing to generate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in which HLA-A, -B, and -C were
selectively ablated, HLA class II molecules eliminated, and multiple tolerogenic factors, including HLA-G, PD-L1,
and CD47 expressed. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) derived from these
PSCs, using our previously reported chemically defined differentiation protocols, were protected from
alloimmune rejection in vitro and in vivo. Further, we have developed new engineering approaches for the
fabrication of mechanically robust, free-standing, ultrathin collagen sheets and related manufacturing tools for
the scalable production of engineered living blood vessels. In this proposal, we postulate that immunoevasive
blood vessels can be efficiently and rapidly manufactured using ‘hypoimmunogenic’ cells and planar extracellular
matrix (ECM) scaffolds of defined composition, content, and microarchitecture. In the process, the efficacy of a
variety of tolerogenic strategies will be evaluated. In this proposal we intend to:
(1) Define the morphological and structural remodeling responses of an engineered living blood vessel
substitute designed to mimic the microstructure of the native vessel wall. Engineered vessels will be
fabricated by seeding primary human vascular wall cells on ultrathin ECM sheets consisting of collagen fibers or
a collagen-elastin multilamellar composite. Biomechanical properties will be tuned in response to microstructure,
and both biochemical and functional responses defined under simulated physiological conditions. Vessels will be
implanted into immunodeficient SRG rats and both phenotypic stability and remodeling responses defined.
(2) Generate ‘hypoimmunogenic’ vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells that evade
immunological rejection. ECs and SMCs will be derived from hypoimmunogenic hPSCs generated by
multiplex genome editing and biological properties determined, including differentiation efficiency, functionality,
absence of HLA proteins, and expression of tolerogenic factors. Angiogenic potential and vessel network
formation will be assessed in vitro and in vivo. Alloreactivity will be evaluated using an in vitro panel of T cell, NK
cell, and macrophage immunoassays, as well as in mice containing human immune system components.
(3) Characterize the phenotypic stability, immunogenicity, and remodeling responses of immunoevasive
engineered living blood vessels. Engineered vessels comprised of hypoimmunogenic cells will be produced
and related biomechanical and biochemical properties characterized. We will determine the capacity of these
vessels to maintain phenotypic stability after in vivo implantation in immunodeficient SRG rats. In the final phase
of these studies, we will determine the ability of vessels engineered from hypoimmunogenic SMCs and ECs to
evade immunological rejection in SRG rats reconstituted with elements of a human immune system."

Nutrition and fasting have long been known to have major effects on the brain. Previous work linking metabolic energy to
brain function has focused on the neural control of feeding, while key mechanisms by which metabolic states control
cognitive function remain unknown. Here we investigate how different metabolic pathways support the fast spiking of
inhibitory interneurons, which in turn generate gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) that are linked to cognitive domains such
as memory formation, motor behavior, perception, and consciousness. The subset of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons
defined by expression of the calcium-binding protein Parvalbumin (PV) are necessary and sufficient to drive gamma
oscillations. These fast-spiking PV interneurons have tremendous energy needs, supported by high metabolism and
mitochondria function. While the extraordinary metabolic activity in PV neurons is well-characterized, the mechanisms
regulating their activity and the consequences of activity regulation on brain oscillations and cognitive function are not
established. We therefore propose to investigate the function of a vertebrate-specific candidate protein (distinctively
expressed in these fast-spiking interneurons) involved in energy generation, and to identify new candidate proteins by a
genetically targeted mitochondrial proteome screen from PV neurons. The main goal of this screen is to identify proteins
that sustain the high energy generation rate as well as proteins that can tune down PV interneuron metabolic activity.
Manipulations of these proteins will then be used to identify the consequences of regulating energy metabolism in PV
interneurons on neuronal network oscillations, with the long-term goal to understand how metabolic homeostasis and
dysregulation in neurons alters brain function in healthy individuals as well as those with brain disorders such as Alzheimer's
disease. Our studies are poised to reveal fundamental insights into the mechanisms that orchestrate energy sources for
network oscillations and that link metabolism to higher order cognitive functions. These insights will form the basis for a
broader understanding of the link between nutrition, brain function and mental health by determining the consequences of
dysfunction of the molecular machinery for energy production in interneurons on brain oscillations that are critical for
cognitive function."
10847991,"PROJECT 4: ABSTRACT
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form lymphoma and is conventionally treated with
a combination of chemotherapeutics with the anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab. Although more than half of patients
can be cured with this approach, the remainder have a dire prognosis with a short survival. DLBCL can be
classified into two subtypes defined by gene expression profiling: the activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center
B-cell (GCB) subtypes. The ABC subtype of DLBCL has worse clinical outcome compared to GCB-DLBCL, and
is characterized by chronically-active signaling driven by its B-cell receptor (BCR) and other signaling mutations
leading to constitutive activation of positive-selection pathways (e.g., NFκB). Despite the variability in patient
outcome and attempts to target ABC-DLBCL with inhibitors of BCR signaling, there are currently no routinely
utilized molecular biomarkers that can be employed to direct a specific therapy. That is, precision medicine does
not currently exist for DLBCL. CREBBP is a lysine acetyltransferases that acts as transcriptional co-activator by
acetylating histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27Ac) and other residues. CREBBP is dynamically loaded onto chromatin
in centrocytes at regions enriched for NFκB and IRF transcription factor motifs, and genes enriched for BCR and
NFκB signaling. In GCB DLBCL, CREBBP is recurrently mutated and we have characterized the effects of these
mutations showing that they cause a loss of antagonism to the BCL6 oncogene and a resulting epigenetic and
transcriptional suppression of BCL6 target genes including those in the BCR and NFκB signaling pathways.
Thus, CREBBP normally functions to activate the expression of BCL6-repressed BCR and NFκB signaling
pathway genes following positive selection in the light zone of the germinal center. In line with this, CREBBP
serves as co-activators for multiple transcription factors that are active in centrocytes and ABC DLBCL, including
IRF4 and NFκB transcription factors REL and RELA. We therefore hypothesize that, despite acting as tumor
suppressors in GCB-DLBCL, the function of CREBBP in driving the expression of BCR and NFκB signaling
pathway genes may be required in ABC-DLBCL. We will investigate this within our program project application
using a number of model systems, including CRISPR-engineered cell lines with inducible expression of surface
BCR, genetically engineered mouse models (Core 1), patient-derived xenograft models (Core 1), and cutting-
edge epigenomic approaches such as CUT&RUN (Core 2). These same model systems and approaches will be
utilized by other projects, allowing us to compare directly to studies of loss of function mutations in CREBBP
(Project 1), the role of histone phosphorylation in signaling to chromatin as a precursor to CREBBP loading
(Project 2), and the role of CREBBP in aged/autoimmune B-cells (Project 3). Together, this will define the
mechanistic role of CREBBP in responding to and regulating BCR and NFκB signaling in ABC DLBCL, and
contribute to a larger holistic model for signaling to chromatin from BCR and the lymphoma microenvironment."

objectives, we will integrate multiple platforms taking advantage of conventional morphology with a large battery
of antibodies and molecular-based approaches (WES, RNAseq, etc.) to define the natural evolution of lymphoid
elements carrying ad hoc defects, stratify the emerging neoplasms in PDX and humanized models and correlate
them with those detected in primary neoplasms. Importantly, primary 2D and 3D cultures and tumor xenografts
have been tested, showing that they essentially mimic the original patient tumor, including tumor heterogeneity,
and they can effectively predict response to therapies. Of note, models from primary patient-derived cultures or
PDX have proven to be more informative than conventional cell lines allowing precise determinations and more
reliable assessments. As many as 85% of drugs within in vitro activity in established cell lines have failed in
human studies, primarily because of a lack of efficacy in complex systems or human settings. Having decided to
interrogate defects that can be observed in unique/rare neoplasms and test the specific relationships between
host and lymphoma elements in young and older individuals, we will take advantage of the lentiviral-mediated
system to create ad hoc models (Project 3). Thus, our models are beneficial for in vivo mechanistic studies (all
projects). The information they provide will be instrumental in understanding the pathogenetic potential of the
defects investigated in this application, leading to potential targeted therapies (Projects 1, 3, and 4)."

The Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC, U24-
AG074855) includes data from 30+ AD research cohorts and represents the largest ongoing effort in the United
States to collect metadata from cohorts for genetic research in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD). The Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA’s) Million Veterans Program (MVP) is one of the world’s
largest genetic research databases, with more than 950,000 United States Veteran participants, including
~650,000 with available whole-genome genotype data and a subset of those genotyped participants (150,000)
with whole-genome sequencing data available soon. MVP participants also reflect the diverse demographics of
Veterans who receive care in VHA—in fact, the MVP includes one of the largest Black and Hispanic genetic
cohorts in the US, who are currently underrepresented in large-scale genetic investigations. However, to date,
due to strict privacy policies, MVP-participant data has been inaccessible to non-VA investigators. To promote
greater use of MVP data, VHA has initiated development of VA Data Commons, a platform that will enable the
analyses of MVP data by researchers outside the VA. This competitive supplement to the ADSP-PHC is the
first step toward coordinated MVP-ADSP genetic investigations in ADRD. This supplement will fund the
curation and mapping of MVP ADRD phenotypic data to be comparable with the harmonized phenotypes in
ADSP-PHC, and deposit those data in the Data Commons according to ADSP-PHC schema. This includes
(Supplementary Aim 1) ADRD diagnoses based on treatment codes and machine learning algorithms;
(Supplementary Aim 2) vascular ADRD risk factors and other comorbidities; (Supplementary Aim 3)
neuroimaging data; and (Supplementary Aim 4) neurocognitive test data. This work will also examine the
demographics and medical comorbidities of MVP participants, thereby setting the stage for comparisons with
diagnoses and other relevant endophenotypes in the ADSP-PHC. The proposed effort will boost the power for
future mapping of genetic risk variants, especially in underrepresented groups, and will significantly enhance
the ADSP’s efforts to unravel the heterogeneity of ADRD genetic risk, onset, symptomology, neuropathology,
and progression, thereby improving the likelihood of identifying new targets for effective ADRD treatment in
diverse populations."

The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) serves as the heart and soul of cancer care in urban Philadelphia
(functioning as Center City Philadelphia’s safety net hospital) and adjacent communities through its vital role in
providing breakthrough discoveries and access to cancer care to all, particularly those underserved populations
with significant social determinant of health challenges and cancer disparities. SKCC is a leader in overcoming
cancer disparities, particularly in disenfranchised urban communities and across the adult lifespan, by actively
engaging investigators, leaders, and the community in bidirectional solutions to remove barriers to care. In this
last project period, the SKCC has undergone numerous advances, made tremendous strides in understanding
and impacting our catchment area, and continues to seek new ways to provide comprehensive care. Andrew
Chapman, DO was appointed Center Director in March of 2021 and has galvanized SKCC leadership and its
members around a refreshed mission and vision through his new comprehensive and inclusively-developed
Strategic Plan, “IMPACT PHL.” The Offices of Cancer Research Administration (OCRA), Community Outreach
and Engagement (COE), Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI), and Training and Education all underwent
infrastructural enhancements to further impact the Center and catchment area. The Consortium Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) was redefined and has transformed the relationship with Drexel University beyond the
MOU to include joint strategic planning, leadership integration, significant financial investment of $1M yearly for
5 years, and the formation of a new oversight committee. The Clinical Trials Office developed the largest Phase
I, first-in-human portfolio in the Tri-State Area (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware), bringing previously
inaccessible interventions to a disparate population. The Programs and Shared Resources were reviewed and
restructured to reflect the work being done at the center as well as the needs of the catchment. Current Programs
are: 1) Cancer Risk and Control (CRiC); 2) Immune Regulation and Targeting (IRT); 3) Translational and Cellular
Oncology (TaCO); 4) Molecular Oncology Regulation and Approaches (MORA). Current Shared Resources are:
1) Biostatistics, Bioinformatics & Research Informatics (BBRISR); 2) BioImaging (BISR); 3) Cancer Genomics
(CGSR); 4) Flow Cytometry & Human Immune Monitoring (FCHIMSR); 5) Integrated Structural Biology (ISBSR);
and 6) Translational Pathology (TPSR). The SKCC is currently comprised of 165 members from 30 departments,
and 6 colleges from two well respected national institutions. Total funding of $61.1 M (DC) includes $40 M in
peer reviewed funding with $14.4 M from the NCI and $21.9 M from other National Institutes of Health. In this
competitive renewal, SKCC requests consideration as a Comprehensive Cancer Center. After discussions with
NCI and with the strong endorsement of our External Advisory Board, the SKCC leadership is of firm belief that
SKCC meets all the criteria for and is deserving of this designation."
10848042,"ABSTRACT: ADMINISTRATION
The Office of Cancer Research Administration (OCRA) at the NCI-designated Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center
(SKCC) provides comprehensive programmatic direction and strategic support across the cancer research
continuum. Administration has developed a strong foundational platform to support the center’s research
infrastructure comprised of 165 members inclusive of four Research Programs, six CCSG-supported Shared
Resources, and a robust clinical trials office. Under the direction of Matthew Huesser, MBA, DBA, who reports
directly to the Center Director, a comprehensive Administration unit has been integrated across the consortium
and aligned with the strategic plan. OCRA is comprised of four groups directly reporting to Huesser: Research
Services, Business Operations, Communications, and Consortium Administration, totaling 20 FTEs, a growth
of eight (40%) over the project period. During that time, business operations were folded into the OCRA,
creating the necessary pathways to align both the research and clinical arms. Furthermore, the OCRA works
directly with centralized institutional offices including the Office of Research Administration (Thomas Jefferson
University’s grants office), the Jefferson Clinical Research Institute (clinical research business and contract
operations), Office of Institutional Advancement (philanthropy), Human Resources, and Marketing.
The activities of Administration are driven by the strategic plan and include ten major functions: 1) Facilitating
strategic planning, implementation, and evaluating processes; 2) Fostering the alignment of catchment area
needs with Research Program priorities; 3) Centralizing documentation and communication efforts related to
SKCC-organized operations, meetings, and retreats; 4) Providing CCSG application oversight including fiscal
management of funds, adherence to NCI guidelines,and CCSG metric reporting; 5) Directing space allocation
processes in order to promote research efficiencies and shared utilization of facilities; 6) Overseeing SKCC
faculty recruitment and retention efforts; 7) Disbursing and supervising developmental funds processes; 8)
Managing clinical research and shared resource operations; 9) Governing membership processes, consortium
relations, and collaborations with other institutions; and 10) Supporting cancer research career enhancement-
related initiatives and center-wide DEI efforts. Key accomplishments during the project period included the
development and implementation of the new SKCC strategic plan (IMPACT PHL), support of leadership during
the Director transition, enhancement of the cancer relevance process, development of mechanisms to enhance
the center’s NCI funding base, completion of a comprehensive SKCC Member refresh in 2021-2022,
development of the SMART system to convert outdated processes and implement a transformational digital
platform, and lastly, strengthening of the consortium partnership."
10848043,"ABSTRACT: CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION
The overall goal of the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) Cancer Research Training and Education
Coordination (CRTEC) Office is to create an integrated and innovative pipeline of activities to inspire and develop
the next generation of cancer researchers and provide diverse workforce career training and mentorship across
the research spectrum. Our commitment to excellence in training and education is central to the SKCC scientific
mission, and directly aligned with our goal to serve as a leading NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center
in a highly diverse region that has persistently high cancer burdens. SKCC believes that investment of effort and
resources into our trainees perpetuates a virtuous cycle wherein the research and clinical missions of our Cancer
Center benefit proportionally to the growth and productivity of our trainees. Trainees are authors on >85% of
SKCC publications and are essential to research in laboratories and population science research teams. They
assist in the implementation of clinical trials, engage in community outreach, and are active citizens in our
communities of learning. The Associate Director (AD) for Training and Education, Felix Kim, PhD, leads CRTEC
activities with the support of SKCC-funded education coordinators. Innovative programmatic activities are offered
to high school and undergraduate students, pre- and post-doctoral trainees, researchers, clinicians, and staff.
Commensurate with expectations from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and in alignment with
our cancer research career enhancement principles, SKCC has developed and incorporated mechanisms at
multiple levels to assist early-career investigators with career development, including four T32 training grants.
Development of a robust cancer research career development training pipeline, mentored development of junior
faculty, and ongoing education and training of cancer researchers across the research spectrum is a fundamental
goal of SKCC and our consortium partners. In addition to the development of innovative and impactful new
training and educational initiatives, CRTEC coordinates existing training and career development activities at
Thomas Jefferson University and Drexel University, including in the preparation of grant applications at all levels.
The specific aims for the CRTEC include: (1) Develop additional platforms for innovative cancer-focused training
of pre- and post-doctoral fellows, clinical research fellows, and junior faculty. (2) Enhance mechanisms to
promote interdisciplinary training and develop core competencies in translational research. (3) Integrate cancer
disparities research training into the SKCC training environment. (4) Integrate CRTEC activities with community
outreach and engagement (COE). Significant strides toward these aims have been achieved in this project
period, and plans for further enhancing innovative approaches to interdisciplinary training, community outreach
and engagement, and integration of cancer health disparities research into SKCC training intitiaives will continue
to be a major focus of the next project period."
10848562,"The overarching goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG), “Comparative Genomics of Longevity and
Alzheimer’s disease” is to identify mechanisms responsible for health and longevity, with the focus on
genome/epigenome stability and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), in long-lived
mammalian species. Mammals differ over 100-fold in their maximum lifespans, from 2 years in a shrew to over
200 years in the bowhead whale. Characterization of the processes responsible for this disparity in lifespan will
enable the development of interventions to prevent or cure age-related diseases including AD and ADRD. The
central hypothesis of this PPG is that long-lived species have evolved more efficient mechanisms to
maintain genome/epigenome stability and prevent Alzheimer’s and ADRD, which can be adapted to
extend human healthspan. In the previous phase of the PPG, we generated exciting data that support our
hypothesis. Specifically, we identified DNA double strand break repair as a mechanism that strongly correlates
with longevity; improved DNA repair in mouse cells by specific amino acid changes; showed that the naked mole
rat hyaluronan synthase 2 gene improves mouse health and lifespan and delays ADRD pathology; showed that
mutation rates are lower in long-lived species; developed epigenetic clocks for naked mole rats; discovered
mechanisms responsible for longevity and genome stability in the longest-lived mammal, the bowhead whale;
identified omics profiles of long-lived species; identified a potential mechanism for sporadic AD in degu; and
generated new mouse models with genes from long-lived mammals. In the next cycle we will expand our studies
to developing interventions and applying novel omics techniques. This PPG is comprised of four integrated
projects and three cores. Project 1 (Gorbunova; Garcia) is focused on mechanisms responsible for more efficient
genome/epigenome stability and developing anti-aging and AD and ADRD interventions. Project 2 (Seluanov;
O’Banion) develops novel animal models of AD resilience (naked mole rat) and sporadic AD (degu). Project 3
(Vijg; Fang) investigates mutations and epimutations in animals with diverse lifespans and in AD models using
novel, high throughput single-molecule approaches. Project 4 (Gladyshev; Tyshkovskii) uses multi-omics to
identify genes and pathways involved in genome/epigenome stability across species and developing aging,
longevity and AD biomarkers. The research team consists of investigators dedicated to longevity research who
are experts in comparative biology and DNA repair (Gorbunova), long-lived rodents (Seluanov), AD and ADRD
(O’Banion), mutagenesis and single-cell approaches (Vijg), comparative genomics and biomarkers (Gladyshev;
Tyshkovskiy); cutting-edge omics techniques, proteomics, and mass spectrometry (Garcia); long-read
sequencing (Fang) and bioinformatics (Zhang, Core C). Moreover, we developed a collection of primary cells
and tissues, and animal colonies, to facilitate comparative studies of longevity and AD (Seluanov, Core B). This
assembly of expertise uniquely positions our team to achieve unprecedented insight into the biology of longevity."
10902699,"Project Summary
This proposal requests funds to support the 77th Annual Symposium of the Society of General Physiologists
(SGP) entitled `Molecular Evolution in the Membrane' from September 4th to September 8th, 2024, at the
Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA. SGP symposia are international meetings for
physiologists, biophysicists, and neuroscientists of all career stages. A different meeting theme is selected
each year, in order to draw focus to an emerging or particularly timely area of research within the field of
physiology. The 2024 meeting will highlight cutting edge research in membrane proteins drawing on the tools
of molecular evolution. Molecular evolution is a powerful tool to understand the origins of functional diversity in
proteins, and has catalyzed a range of discoveries pertaining to diverse topics like drug discovery, structure
prediction, and the mechanistic underpinnings of complex physiologies. The 2024 meeting will bring together
~150 scientists and trainees to discuss cutting-edge fundamental research that applies the tools of molecular
evolution to understanding the mechanisms of transporters, ion channels, and receptors with significance to
physiology and human health. This meeting size is large enough to represent a diverse range of research
areas, and small enough to maximize individual discussions and foster collaborative interactions between
students, postdoctoral fellows, early-career investigators, and established leaders in their fields. The
organizers, Drs. Randy Stockbridge (University of Michigan) and Lucy Forrest (NIH/NINDS) have significant
expertise in experimental and computational approaches to understand mechanisms of membrane transport
proteins. A highly accomplished and diverse international group of 24 speakers that will contribute to a
synergistic environment at the meeting. The meeting program also includes roundtable discussions on topics
of diversity/inclusivity and professional development, along with poster sessions, short talks selected from
abstracts, and 2-minute poster preview talks. The SGP has a long track record of providing outstanding
administrative support, and the Marine Biological Laboratory venue is historical, conveniently located, and an
excellent meeting environment. All these factors will help ensure a successful meeting."
10848674,"Senior leadership for Roswell Park Cancer Comprehensive Cancer Center works collaboratively to implement
critical planning and evaluation processes that include recruitment efforts, research initiatives, clinical trial
growth, educational programs, and operational objectives as outlined in the strategic plan responsive to our
catchment area. Candace Johnson (DT), as the CCSG Director and President and CEO of Roswell Park, has
ultimate authority over space allocation, finances, strategic initiatives, and clinical and scientific operations. She
is joined on the CCSG leadership team by Renier Brentjens (TII) as Deputy Director and eight Associate
Directors, who collectively possess valuable experience that encompasses all aspects of basic, clinical cancer
research, cancer prevention and control, cancer education and training, community outreach and building equity
and inclusion.
 Completed in 2023, the CCSG strategic planning process culminated in a dynamic strategic plan built with
input from both programmatic and senior leadership. The strategic plan includes key objectives to ensure the
continued delivery of exceptional scientific research, education and clinical care and is directly responsive to
community partner recommendations. Business planning metrics and benchmarks were incorporated to provide
the senior leadership team with effective mechanisms to continually evaluate success.
 Leadership, planning and evaluation efforts rely upon key internal advisory committees, community
members, and external advisory boards, which inform leadership about important local, regional and national
issues impacting the cancer center. There are 4 main committees that provide input into strategic decision
making: 1) The bi-weekly Strategic Council meeting that includes both senior leadership of the cancer center
and the Associate Directors, 2) the monthly CCSG Steering Committee with Associate Directors, Program
Leaders, select Shared Resource Directors, and other contributors to set directions for cancer center planning.
3) The annual External Advisory Board meetings which provide critical feedback and guidance regarding
programmatic direction, shared resources and research progress. In addition, individual program advisory
boards meet every 12 months and help guide decisions on revisions to programmatic aims and ways to foster
community engagement in an inclusive and equitable environment. And 4) the Community Advisory Board
which meets quarterly to discuss catchment-level issues impacting the broader community around the medical
campus as well as to guide the programmatic direction of the center as it relates to the community. In addition
to these 4 main committees, the Associate Directors lead committees to engage faculty in their specialty areas
to ensure there is bi-directional communication occurring among all levels of the cancer center.
 At its core, leadership, planning and evaluation are the foundational ingredients that have and will continue
to drive Roswell Park to achieving its strategic goals in the upcoming renewal period."
10848675,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (Roswell Park) operates nine Cancer Center Support Grant
(CCSG) shared resources and eight institutionally supported shared resources. All 17 shared resources are
centrally managed through the Shared Resource Management Office (SRMO), a division of our Research
Support Services Department. The mission of the SRMO is to provide exceptional service delivery within the
shared resources to our members. All SRMO personnel are members of the CCSG administration team. The
SRMO, CCSG Administration, and Shared Resource Advisory Committees (SRACs) oversee, guide, and
support the Shared Resource Directors and appropriate Associate Directors in enabling access to advanced
research technologies and technical capabilities for all CCSG members. During the project period, Roswell Park
reconfigured the CCSG shared resources to facilitate stronger leadership, streamlined processes, and improved
financial oversight. In consultation with the CCSG External Advisory Board, and each of the SRACs, the SRMO
consolidated the services and leadership of 8 shared resources into 4 combined CCSG shared resources to
strategically align better with the needs of our CCSG members. The SRMO facilitates consolidated/centralized
billing, operational guidance, human resources support, equipment and service line management, and support
for the marketing of services offered by the individual shared resources.
The Specific Aims for Shared Resource Management are:
AIM 1: To provide comprehensive oversight for Roswell Park shared resources, with the goal of effectively
managing strategic alignment, operations, marketing, and training.
AIM 2: To evaluate the need for new specialized technologies, services, and expertise that enhance scientific
interactions and productivity.
AIM 3: To engage with shared resource leaders and invest in service delivery and purchase of new equipment
that leads to cost-effective, reliable, and quality-controlled processes.
AIM 4: To establish policies for shared resource access, use, and financial management thereby ensuring
appropriate services are available and cost effective for all CCSG members.
The SRMO plans to continue to provide administrative, financial, and oversight management and exceptional
support to our CCSG members. Roswell Park places a strong focus on advanced technologies to maintain our
status as leaders in cancer research and patient care. In support of our strategic plan, the SRMO will continue
to the support existing shared resources and facilitate the development of new shared resources and services
in areas such as metabolomics, current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), community engagement, and
software development."
10861917,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental patterns,
increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in adulthood.
In response to RFA-AA-21-007, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National Consortium
on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-A) to follow for the next 5 years a
diverse community sample of male and female participants recruited in three age bands (12-14, 15-17, 18-21
years old) when most were no-to-low drinkers and tracked over the last 8 years across 5 sites (N=831; 93%
retention rate). Monitoring has involved annually acquired multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting state
fMRI, task fMRI), cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or remotely by computer
and our mobile app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced neuroimaging and sleep
and physical activity tracking. This cohort sequential design uniquely positions NCANDA-A to quantify transient
or enduring alcohol-related disturbances in specific adolescent and early adult neural system growth trajectories
and functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, NCANDA-A
will investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on
subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol's effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g., age
of drinking onset) that forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A will quantify the
impact of the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and their relations
with alcohol use patterns. In Aim 5, the SRI and Pittsburgh sites will identify interactions among patterns of
alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac function. In Aim 6, the UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites will determine the extent to
which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect,
sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects of frequent binge
alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history, impact of alcohol
use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors will be tested.
With the longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information to the public on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning by
discovering elements and mechanisms linking these dynamic processes and identifying modifiable risk factors."

The goal of this administrative supplement is to support research training and mentoring for Ms. LeeAnne
Tunstall in the post-baccalaureate category. Ms. Tunstall graduated from Virginia Tech in May 2023 with a
Bachelor of Science in Psychology and minor concentration in Adaptive Brain and Behavior. Long-term, she is
interested in pursuing a research career in neuroscience. Ms. Tunstall’s research experience will be
considerably enhanced by dedicated mentoring by the PI, intellectually stimulating scientific and clinical
environment at Duke, formal and informal educational experiences, and peer networking opportunities with
post-baccalaureate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees at Duke. The parent grant will investigate resting-
state functional connectivity in PTSD, but does not change or duplicate the overall goals or hypotheses of the
parent award. The parent project aims to identify resting-state fMRI neural signatures that are common and
unique across DSM diagnoses of PTSD and MDD, compares comorbid PTSD and MDD, pure PTSD, pure
MDD, and Controls in functional brain networks involved with arousal, fear, salience, and executive processing,
and finally investigates trans-diagnostic symptoms shared by PTSD and MDD.
The goal of Specific Aim 1 is: Investigate the relationship between PTSD re-experiencing symptoms and DMN
/ CEN connectivity, and the relationship between PTSD hypervigilance symptoms SN connectivity. Hypothesis:
We predict that re-experiencing symptoms will be positively associated with DMN activity and re-experiencing
symptoms will be negatively associated with CEN activity. Thus, there will be a reciprocal relationship between
DMN and CEN activity. We predict that patients with more severe re-experiencing symptoms will spend greater
time in a DMN-dominant state whereas patients with mild re-experiencing symptoms will spend relatively less
time in a DMN-dominant state, effectively modulating DMN-CEN network imbalance.
The goal of Specific Aim 2 is: Investigate the relationship between PTSD re-experiencing symptoms and
DMN-cerebellar / DMN-cerebellar subregions, CEN-cerebellar / CEN-cerebellar subregion / SN-cerebellar /
SN-cerebellar subregion connectivity. Hypothesis: We predict altered CEN, SN, and DMN connectivity to
cerebellum and cerebellar sub-structures in PTSD. We hypothesize that the PTSD effects will be more
pronounced in the neocerebellum than the archicerebellum (i.e. diagnosis x sub-structural interaction). We
expect more severe PTSD re-experiencing symptoms will tip the balance to stronger DMN-cerebellar and
DMN-cerebellar sub-structural connectivity, but weaker CEN-cerebellar, CEN-cerebellar sub-structural
connectivity in PTSD. We expect more severe PTSD hypervigilance symptoms will tip the balance to stronger
SN-cerebellar and SN-cerebellar sub-structural connectivity in PTSD."
10862291,"ABSTRACT: Project 1, The Epidemiology of Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome
A proportion of early Lyme disease patients who have been treated with standard antibiotic regimens
experience persistent ill health for weeks to months, a condition known as Post Treatment Lyme Disease
Syndrome or “PTLDS”. The biologic basis for persistent Lyme disease remains to be described. The
overarching goal of our Program Project proposal is to generate fundamental knowledge about recovery from
Lyme disease, a growing human health problem worldwide, and better understand the mechanisms of
progression to PTLDS. In this epidemiological Project 1, we shall determine PTLDS incidence through a
prospective standardized assessment of a large patient cohort at the start of treatment for early Lyme disease.
We are particularly interested in the role of coinfections as potential factors in the development of PTLDS:
there are 4 other zoonotic agents transmitted by deer ticks, as well as flea or mosquito-borne infections in
northeastern U.S. sites, and thus Lyme disease cases may be concurrently or sequentially exposed to these
other infections. We shall re-examine pre-morbidity or concurrent clinical risk factors as a predictor for PTLDS.
Finally, we shall estimate the burden of PTLDS, seeking to place its public health importance into context of
other chronic disease in the study sites. This Project leverages the acute (early) Lyme disease enrollments
across a large study network of our Program Project, and complements this major effort with a serological
survey based in long-term tick borne disease study sites in coastal New England communities. Results from
our questionnaires and coinfection studies, framed by the analyses of all samples by the Diagnostic Core, will
help inform the findings of Project 2 (host immune dysregulation and autoantibodies), which in turn will place
premorbid or other risk associations of PTLDS into context. Ultimately, the findings from the proposed
epidemiological project may contribute to modalities for preventing, treating, and reducing the public health
burden of PTLDS."
10862292,"ABSTRACT: Project 2, Immunology of Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome
Similarities between symptoms of Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) and symptoms seen with
fibromyalgia, auto-immune diseases and post-acute sequelae of other infectious diseases are suggestive of a
shared common pathway underlying the symptoms. Immune responses to different stimuli may activate similar
pathways and have long been suspected as a culprit in these syndromes. Prior studies of patients with PTLDS
have shown evidence of specific immune activation when compared with subjects that have recovered from
Lyme disease-- although these studies have been inconsistent between different studies. Multiple auto-
antibodies have been identified after infection with Lyme disease however the association for any specific auto-
antibody remains undetermined. Antibodies from patients with PTLDS vs recovered Lyme disease have been
shown by one group to bind to neural tissue suggesting a possible mechanism for the persistence of
symptoms.
In this Project, we will utilize samples collected by our Clinical Coordination Core to compare responses
between patients with PTLDS and recovered Lyme disease. In Aim 1, we will look at inflammatory responses
to infection both acutely and with persistence of symptoms using multiple unbiased high throughput methods
for examining both protein and gene expression. We will compare the cellular composition between these
groups of patients using high dimensional flow cytometry followed by bulk RNAseq to determine gene
expression within specific cell types. In Aim 2 we will look for correlation of antibodies that recognize either
specific Borrelia burgdorferi components or self-antigens with PTLDS using unbiased Phage display
Immunoprecipitation sequencing technology (PhIPseq) and peptide microarrays. We will also test for the
presence of antibodies to host phospholipids which we have previously identified as potentially linked to
PTLDS. Finally, we will confirm whether antibodies from PTLDS patients preferentially bind neural tissue
compared with serum from recovered Lyme patients. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the role of T cell
reactivity in PTLDS. We will look at specific HLA-DR correlations with PTLDS. We will then identify candidate
B. burgdorferi or self-peptides that are presented in association with HLA-DR molecules using nano-liquid
chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry.
At the completion of this Project, we will have tested multiple hypotheses regarding the role of the immune
response to B. burgdorferi in the development of PTLDS. This information will be combined with data from
Projects 1 and 3 to create a multi-modal model of PTLDS development."
10837129,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fungal infections significantly impact human health, both in terms of mortality and treatment cost. While anti-
fungal drugs have been the leading therapy for fungal infections, there is an increasing incidence of resistant
fungal infections that are difficult to treat. An alternative approach to disrupting fungal cell wall synthesis with
drugs is the active degradation of fungal cell wall polysaccharides. However, there is a substantial knowledge
gap in regards to the requirements for effective fungal cell wall degradation. This shortfall prevents the
development of new anti-fungal therapies that could be used alone or in combination with current drug
treatments. The long-term goal of this project is to develop mechanistic understanding of polysaccharide
deconstruction to produce medically relevant enzymes. The objective of this particular proposal is focused on
identifying and characterizing the mechanisms for the degradation of fungal cell wall polysaccharides by the
bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus. Our central hypothesis is that a coordinated suite of enzymes is required to
effectively degrade the glucan and chitin components of fungal cell walls. We will test this hypothesis with three
Specific Aims: (1) Multiomic analyses during degradation of fungal cell wall polysaccharides, (2) Functional
analysis of genes that encode enzymes essential for fungal cell wall deconstruction, and (3) Quantitative
enzymology of fungal cell wall degrading enzymes. For the first Aim, we will use established transcriptomic and
proteomic methods to decipher the complex gene and protein expression patterns of C. japonicus when actively
degrading the fungal cell walls of Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Novel targets will be
placed in a functional context by subsequent genetic analysis. The second Aim will determine the contribution of
individual gene products for the deconstruction of fungal cell walls. We have established both transposon and
high-throughput targeted mutational approaches to identify and analyze genes that are essential for
polysaccharide degradation in C. japonicus. We will test the fitness of mutant strains lacking these genes with
growth assays using insoluble fungal cell wall polysaccharides and intact fungal biomass. For the third Aim, we
will purify and characterize enzymes capable of degrading fungal cell wall polysaccharides to determine their
substrate specificity, kinetic parameters, and to assess enzyme synergy. The use of fungal biomass as a
substrate will allow us to determine what enzyme combinations are maximally effective at deconstructing intact
fungal cell walls. These approaches are innovative because we use a bacterium that has a robust polysaccharide
degrading capability coupled with a novel screen that uses intact fungal biomass, which includes filamentous
fungi and yeasts. This project is significant because it will characterize enzymes with medically-relevant
properties, give mechanistic insight into the requirements for the effective disruption of fungal cell walls, and
generate a powerful system for the discovery of enzymes that have anti-fungal potential."

Macrophages are critical components of the innate immune system that sample the local environment, respond
to stimuli and return tissues to homeostasis. Distinct macrophage populations play unique roles in these
processes. Macrophages derived from circulating monocytes are rapidly recruited to infections, are
inflammatory, and are generally short-lived. In contrast, long-lived tissue resident macrophages (TRMs) are
derived from fetal liver cells and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the absence of infections.
While monocyte-derived macrophages are well defined, due to experimental limitations there remain many
open questions regarding how TRMs are maintained and contribute to regulating the local environment. To
address these key gaps in knowledge my research group is developing new ex vivo models of distinct TRM
populations that can then be probed using functional genetics. We recently developed an ex vivo model for
lung-specific TRMs, alveolar macrophages (AMs), that maintain expression of AM-specific markers and
function. Using this model we engineered a genome-wide knockout library in AM-like cells that enables rapid
forward genetic screens using our customized screening pipeline. Over the next five years my research group
will leverage this innovative resource to dissect underlying biological mechanisms related to AM maintenance
and function. We will comprehensively define the genes required to maintain cells in the AM-like state using a
combination of iterative genetic screens with in-depth functional characterization. These experiments will
uncover entirely novel signaling and transcriptional networks activated in AMs during homeostasis. In parallel,
we will compare the genetic control of core macrophage functions between myeloid-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) and AM-like cells. While there are metabolic and transcriptional differences between BMDMs and
AMs, it remains entirely unknown how these differences alter genetic control of macrophage functions like
phagocytosis. We will complete screens in both BMDMs and AM-like cells probing phagocytosis of distinct
cargo. These datasets will define shared and unique pathways that control core macrophage functions and will
illuminate new mechanisms of fundamental biological processes. Finally, my research group will lay the
groundwork for dissecting genetic pathways in AMs in intact animals by optimizing a cell transfer and
screening pipeline. Using this model, we will uncover the in vivo role of key AM genes and identify new
pathways required for AMs to maintain lung homeostasis. Accomplishing these goals will position my research
group to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling AMs in detail not previously possible. Our long-
term goal is to expand these approaches and findings to more broadly understand other TRM populations by
identifying shared mechanisms of function and maintenance."

 Cerebral aneurysms are estimated to be prevalent in 3–7% of the general population—with cases increasing
by more than 5% each year—resulting in ~500,000 deaths annually. Minimally invasive neurosurgery typically
represents the best surgical option for treating unruptured aneurysms due to benefits including reduced length
of stay and complications compared to invasive surgical clipping. Endovascular neurointerventions rely on
microcatheters to traverse cerebral anatomy safely to deliver embolic devices or stents for aneurysm treatment.
In many cases, however, tortuous vasculature and geometrically complex aneurysms pose substantial
navigation challenges for neurointerventionalists due to an inability to maneuver conventional microcatheters
safely. These difficulties in navigating such cerebrovascular anatomies contribute to longer procedural times,
unsuccessful catheterization attempts, and increased risks of complications. To address the clinical need for
neurosurgical microcatheters that overcome these maneuverability-associated barriers, we propose to engineer
and evaluate 3D-nanoprinted soft robotic microcatheters with integrated microfluidic circuitry as a means to
enable on-demand, multi-directional steering and navigation control during endovascular neurointerventions.
Our overarching hypothesis is that, by leveraging and extending recent advances at the intersection of machine
learning-based design, additive nanomanufacturing, integrated microfluidic circuitry, and soft microrobotics,
novel classes of remotely steerable neurosurgical microcatheters can be realized at unprecedented scales to
surmount current maneuverability-based deficits, and ultimately, improve catheterization efficacy, safety, and
outcomes in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. We will investigate the clinical feasibility of this hypothesis
through four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will create machine learning-based design techniques for predicting and
informing the operational performance of the soft robotic microcatheter. In Aim 2, we will examine the manu-
facturing efficacy for 3D nanoprinting multi-actuator tips and integrated microfluidic circuits both independently
and as fully unified soft robotic microcatheters capable of on-demand, multi-directional deformations with minimal
infrastructure and external control scheme-associated requirements. In Aim 3, we will develop a handheld
controller for the neurointerventionalist and compare the maneuverability efficacy of the soft robotic micro-
catheter to that of standard clinical microcatheters using in vitro models of cerebrovascular anatomy based on
patient-specific clinical 3D angiography images. In Aim 4, we will assess the feasibility and safety of the soft
robotic microcatheter (i.e., with respect to standard clinical microcatheters) by performing minimally invasive
endovascular neurointerventions in animal models (canine, n=8). If successful, the proposed 3D-nanoprinted
soft robotic microcatheters hold unique promise to be transformative not only for treating cerebral aneurysms,
but also for wide-ranging endovascular interventions currently considered challenging or high risk due to small,
complex, tortuous, and/or delicate vasculature, such as for the treatment of pediatric congenital heart defects."

10837321,"Project 1 Abstract:
Malaria burden has significantly decrease across sub–Saharan Africa over the last decades following the scale
up of effective control interventions. However, interruption of malaria transmission in endemic area remains a
challenge for most endemic countries specifically in Sub Saharan Africa. In endemic settings, clinical immunity
associated with age and multiple exposure to malaria infection leads to the presence of high proportion of
asymptomatic infection that could persist for months and contribute to establish a permanent source of infection
for malaria vectors. The gap in our knowledge this project will fill is to identify the human malaria parasite
reservoir starting from the end of malaria transmission season to the start of following wet season and their
contribution to the initiation of the yearly transmission season across different ecological settings in West Africa.
The goal of this project is to assess factors which determine the persistence of malaria transmission
during the dry season in rural and urban settings to identify more aggressive and/or novel strategies
targeting these areas. The specific aims are 1] Assess the risk factors associated with P. falciparum residual
infection in relation with malaria incidence (uncomplicated and severe malaria) and current control interventions
across three endemic settings in Mali); 2] Assess epidemiologic patterns and determinants of malaria risk in
urban and peri-urban setting of Bamako; 3] Assess the impact of the optimized combination of standard control
interventions on the disease burden associated with residual malaria transmission. This project links the different
aspects of malaria parasite reservoir during the dry season, malaria transmission and disease during the wet
season into a unified whole including a range of immune responses (Project 2, Immunopathogenesis) and
seasonal and geographical distribution of Anopheline mosquitoes vectors (Project 3). Understanding
the residual malaria transmission relating entomologic and epidemiological patterns will provide more definitive
guidelines for targeted malaria control intervention in Mali and in West Africa"
10837323,"Summary
The project goal is to investigate the urban-rural continuum of malaria transmission in relation to vector ecology
in urban, peri-urban, and surrounding rural areas of Bamako, Mali. Steps to mount effective malaria elimination
programs in African countries are confounded by the resilience of the major vector species in the Anopheles
gambiae complex. There are the well-known obstacles due to insecticide resistance and shifts in vector behavior
to outdoor residual transmission. However, the challenge of elimination is even more complex and may not be
solved even with the addition of new vector control tools. This project, which will be conducted in Mali, builds on
data from 15 years of continuous NIH ICEMR support. During this period, there has been a decline in both human
and vector transmission indicators following the scale up of core malaria control interventions. These
interventions have been primarily implemented in rural settings because of the high malaria endemicity. In
contrast, in urban settings of Bamako, there is a low prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria (1-3%), and
health facilities report malaria cases diagnosed year-long with a high proportion of severe malaria. This renewal
application expends the vector ecology research capacity built in the ICEMR to address key issues related to
malaria transmission in urban Bamako and its surrounding areas. Specific Aims include: 1) Determine the
contribution of endogenous and exogenous sources of malaria mosquitoes in urban settings; 2) Determine
spatial/ temporal concentrations and survival of malaria mosquitoes in urban, semiurban, and surrounding rural
areas; 3) Assess insecticide resistance of Anopheline mosquito vectors in different ecological settings, in
association with selection pressure regimes and potential impact on malaria transmission. This approach will
generate new findings of high public health importance considering accelerating socio-economic and
environmental changes in West African cities. Research will detail how future shifts in the species composition
of primary and secondary local vector populations will change, especially with the imminent arrival of the invasive
Anopheles stephensi. Overall, this project takes a holistic approach to reveal new aspects of vector ecology that
impact the complexity and changing epidemiology of malaria parasite transmission in West Africa."
10837562,"Project Summary – Burkina Faso ICEMR Overall Project
This project will establish the Burkina Faso ICEMR, intended to bring together local and international experts in
the host, parasite, and vector, under one umbrella to define the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of malaria across
the Sudan, Sudan-Sahel, and Sahelian zones of Burkina Faso and within differing landscape environments
(urban, rural, and migrant/gold-mining camps). In this process, parasite (species and genetics) and host data
(including age and clinical status) will be tightly linked to the complexity of vector species (primary and
secondary), their locations near transient or permanent water sources, and translational studies of vector
competence, transmission dynamics, and drug and insecticide resistance. The malariology experts in this ICEMR
are long-term collaborators and comprise field and lab scientists, clinicians, biostatisticians, and data specialists
at the four key institutions, Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé, Institut des Sciences et Techniques,
Colorado State University and Yale School of Public Health, as well as at partner institutions inside Burkina Faso
and the U.S. Together they will form an Administrative Core to provide organizational capacity for the entire
project, to manage budgets, facilitate the science, enhance communication within and outside of the project, and
foster capacity building among all partners. We will also form a Data Management Core, which will provide
infrastructure and oversight for the coordination of data collection and analysis occurring across ICEMR
institutions in Burkina Faso and in the U.S. And we will initiate two interconnected research projects that will seek
to reassess malaria epidemiology in the country. The first project will characterize the epidemiology of all human
species across study sites via testing of mosquito blood meals and conducting longitudinal household-based
cohorts over three years. The goal of these studies will be to carefully characterize the epidemiology and clinical
impact of mono- and mixed species infections and to understand the performance of current diagnostics for
detecting the symptomatic and asymptomatic reservoir of infection. We will also utilize samples to characterize
their ex vivo and genetic resistance profiles to current and promising antimalarials. The second project will assess
the natural vector bionomics and parasite transmission across spatiotemporal gradients, perform laboratory
experiments of parasite transmission to validate our field findings using wild type mosquitoes and parasites, and
also expose these infected mosquitoes to sub-lethal insecticide concentrations or drugs that the vectors are
likely to encounter during the extrinsic incubation period in the field to determine if this influences parasite
transmission. With the data from these projects and support from the Cores, we ultimately hope to inform country-
wide policies, and build the local skill set and resources to sustainably advance malaria control across the country
and identify specific strategies to help better control malaria in the greater West African region."

This grant proposal requests funding for a NovaSeq X Plus system manufactured by Illumina,
San Diego, CA. This instrument will be incorporated into a successful Genomics facility, the
Molecular Biology Core Facilities (MBCF) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). This core

existing Next-Generation sequencing services currently provided by the MBCF on two Illumina
NextSeq 550s, 4 MiSeqs, a MiniSeq and a NovaSeq 6000. This expansion will allow cost
effective and rapid turnaround time for whole genome sequencing, whole genome methylation

and substantially less expensive cost per basepair will increase the economic feasibility of much
larger projects and improve access to cutting edge technology for smaller projects."
10835962,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Between 24-40% of cancer patients in the U.S. use cannabis, principally to manage pain, anxiety, and insomnia.
Importantly, evidence suggests that some patients may be substituting cannabis as a strategy to reduce opioid
consumption. However, cannabis’ historical classification as a Schedule I substance (i.e., a controlled substance
with no known medical use) by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration has created barriers to
conducting rigorous research on its role in cancer symptom management. As a result, the 2021 National
Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Adult Cancer Pain guidelines state: “Data supporting the use of cannabinoids
as adjuvant analgesics for treatment of cancer pain are extremely limited and the results from what data exist
are somewhat conflicting”. Moreover, despite abundant evidence of racial disparities in cancer pain treatment,
little is known about the role of cannabis in mitigating racial disparities in cancer pain outcomes. Thus, there is a
critical need to conduct rigorously designed research to generate new knowledge of this phenomenon. Using
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology and a 12-month prospective cohort design, we propose
a multisite study at three health systems in the northeastern U.S. We will enroll 600 (200 per site) ambulatory
patients with non-skin solid malignancies who are receiving opioid therapy: 300 cannabis users (weekly use in
any form in the prior month) and 300 cannabis non-users (no use in the past 3 months). Of these, 50% will be
self-identified African American patients and 50% will be White. Cannabis and opioid use will be assessed via
EMA (collected for 1 week/month; 84 days total) and monthly phone surveys and patient reported outcomes
(PROs) will be assessed via monthly phone surveys. This study will also describe the poorly understood
phenomenon of cannabis use patterns over time by elucidating dynamic within- and between-subject changes
in cannabis use, PROs, and opioid use over the course of one year. The Specific Aims are to: (1) describe
dynamic within- and between-subject changes in cannabis use over time including frequency, route, source
(medical vs. non-medical), indication, and composition; (2) assess if cannabis use over time is associated with
key PROs (pain severity and pain-related function, sleep, anxiety, and quality of life) and opioid use (subjective
and objective indices) among cancer patients; (3) test if cannabis use moderates the association between race
and pain severity; and (4) explore potential moderators of the relationship among cannabis use, PROs, and
opioid use including cannabis frequency, source, route, and composition, and current opioid misuse measure.
This timely and comprehensive study has high potential to generate new knowledge upon which clinical practice
and guidelines related to cannabis use in cancer pain and symptom management may be based. The strong
multidisciplinary research team brings the requisite expertise in cancer-related pain, medical cannabis,
longitudinal opioid use among patients with cancer, substance misuse, and health disparities. Overall, this

10835963,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The opioid crisis has caused a national decline in average U.S. life-expectancy necessitating a declaration of a
federal public health emergency. Evidence indicates that OUD is a chronic health condition best managed with
long-term use of medications (MOUD). While MOUD save lives, reduce related harms, and enhance the
likelihood of remission, compared to other substance use disorders, individuals suffering from OUD tend to be
more in need of additional services, feel more isolated and marginalized, have fewer available recovery assets
(e.g., jobs, safe housing) and report lower quality of life. These continued deficits increase biobehavioral stress
and prognostic pessimism and, in turn, the odds of treatment discontinuation and subsequent relapse. There is
a need for additional recovery support services (RSS) to help build positive social networks and to increase
education, training, employment, and housing opportunities (collectively known as “recovery capital”) to enhance
functioning and quality of life. Recovery Community Centers (RCCs) are emergent national entities designed
specifically to help provide this growth in recovery capital and enhance remission and quality of life. Preliminary
evidence indicates RCCs play a particularly valuable role for those with OUD, but despite their strong conceptual
basis and rapid largescale investment in their growth, little is known from a systematic research standpoint about
their clinical and public health utility and cost-effectiveness. To advance the development of efficacy and
effectiveness research on RCCs for persons who were or who are being maintained on medications for the
treatment of OUD (P-MOUD), we propose to orchestrate activities on a national level to engage multiple
stakeholders and produce actionable deliverables. This proposal draws and builds upon numerous professional
and academic resources and experiences, including the existence of our already established recovery
dissemination platform (i.e., the Recovery Research Institute (RRI); 6,000 Bulletin readers, 37,000 Twitter
followers, 24,000 website visitors per month), which due to its reputation and experience has been contracted
by SAMHSA to first sum up the evidence on recovery support services and then to facilitate the first multi-
stakeholder discussion on a national level to advance the science of RSS. In the spirit of the patient maxim,
“nothing about us without us”, we have formulated a plan of action that engages and involves key support-
receiving stakeholders in multiple aspects of our network plan. Five types of activities are proposed (i.e., monthly
seminar series, pilot funding, symposium presentations at national conferences, advisory board meetings with
RCC staff and attendees, hands-on support to RCC personnel to track and analyze organizational data), each
of which will result in concrete deliverables. In so doing, the RRI will become a known hub for the science on
recovery support via RCCs, and will attract, collect and disseminate ancillary products that support the building
of a cumulative RCC science that can explicate the role of RCCs in providing support specifically for P-MOUD."
10835965,"One of the missing high-impact opportunities in immuno-oncology has been the inability to maximally exploit the
synergy between conventional chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy. The premise of the current proposal
is that successful chemo-immunotherapy critically depends on eliciting robustly immunogenic, pro-inflammatory
antigen-presenting cells that can cross-present tumor antigens. In tumors at baseline, however, the cross-
presenting dendritic cell (DC) population is profoundly defective, and the default immune response is tolerance
and immunosuppression. How to change this defect has been unclear. This proposal tests the hypothesis
that Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) in tumor-associate myeloid cells represents a powerful and previously
unrecognized innate-immune system checkpoint, that dominantly suppresses the emergence of a key population
of highly pro-inflammatory monocyte-lineage DCs during chemotherapy. If the suppression by this myeloid BTK
checkpoint can be overcome, then dying tumor cells now become able to spontaneously elicit large numbers of
inflammatory monocytic DCs, which drive robust and sustained anti-tumor immunity. Aim 1 will use genetically-
defined models to identify the specific myeloid-lineage cells in tumors that are suppressed by BTK. It will test
the hypothesis that when the BTK checkpoint is blocked during chemotherapy, these immature myeloid cells
now become able to rapidly mature into inflammatory DCs. These activated DCs reprogram the “cold” tumor
milieu into a “hot” pro-inflammatory microenvironment, and re-activate anergic CD8+ effector T cells. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that the BTK checkpoint is normally dominant in tumors, because it is constantly driven by
key tolerogenic signals such as tumor-induced Tregs and local TGFβ. However, if this repressive BTK pathway
is blocked, then immature myeloid cells in tumors become able to mature into inflammatory APCs in response
to signals from dying tumor cells. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the tolerogenic indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase (IDO) pathway is tightly coupled to the BTK checkpoint in myeloid cells. During chemotherapy,
IDO acts as a direct cell-intrinsic metabolic signaling pathway downstream of BTK, allowing BTK to suppress the
maturation-inducing mTOR pathway in DCs. IDO is also elicited by dying tumor cells during chemotherapy as a
paracrine pathway in plasmacytoid DCs and tumor-associated macrophages, which activate Tregs and produce
local TGFβ to reinforces the BTK checkpoint. Thus, blocking both BTK and IDO together creates potent
mechanistic synergy, and allows robust anti-tumor immune activation during even modest chemotherapy.
 Relevance: If the proposed strategies are successful, this will bring a novel, high-impact approach to
chemo-immunotherapy, focused on eliciting a crucial population of immunogenic antigen-presenting cells. BTK-
inhibitor drugs are approved, and IDO-inhibitor drugs are in clinical trials, so translation to the clinic would be
rapid and direct."
10835933,"Animals and humans display a vast repertoire of behaviors, many of which are generated by motor
networks in the spinal cord. This coordinated spinal motor activity is strongly regulated by descending
motor control pathways and sensory afferent feedback. Sensory feedback is essential for both
stereotypical protective reflexes, such as limb withdrawal, and for regulating ongoing motor behaviors,
such as walking, running, and reaching. Interestingly, many descending motor control pathways converge
on interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord that transmit sensory information, indicating a prominent role for
these cells in motor control. Currently, very little is known about how sensorimotor networks in the spinal
cord are organized at a cellular level. Efforts proposed here will use cutting-edge genetic manipulations
and sensitive behavioral assays to deconstruct the cellular composition and synaptic connectivity of these
sensorimotor circuits. The goals of this study are to functionally define the neuronal cell types that make
up the sensorimotor circuitry and to generate a connectivity map that can then be used to construct a
working model of how the sensorimotor circuitry is organized. Intersectional mouse genetics will be used
to target specific populations of spinal neurons and ask whether inactivating or activating them with
chemogenetic and optogenetic reporters perturbs specific sensorimotor pathways, including those that
generate corrective behaviors during ongoing movement and noxious mechanical pathways that induce
protective reflexes. Studies of protective and corrective reflexes will be complemented with an analysis of
the sensory circuitry for the control of forelimb reaching and grasping behaviors. These studies, when
completed, will provide new insights into the organization of the spinal reflex circuitry, and improve our
understanding of the cellular computations that underlie sensorimotor transformation in the spinal cord."
10835934,"Project Summary
In recent years, cancer treatment has dramatically shifted towards a centralized model of care,
whereby patients with cancer selectively receive complex treatment at regional referral centers, which
tend to be tertiary cancer centers. Centralization is associated with improved outcomes for the
patients who receive care at regional referral centers for a variety of reasons, including better
resources and personnel who treat high volumes of patients. However, the broader impact of
centralization on outcomes at the population level remains unknown. Of specific concern are the
patients who do not receive care at these centers, but instead continue to receive care at non-regional
referral centers, which generally treat lower volumes of patients. These “left behind” patients may
suffer poor outcomes due to decreased access to high-quality care. Moreover, to the degree these
patients represent traditionally underserved patients (i.e., sociodemographic groups that have long
experienced health disparities such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income individuals, and rural
residents), the trend towards centralized cancer care may inadvertently widen disparities in outcomes,
worsening care for those patients left behind. The overall goal of this project is to critically examine
the impact of cancer treatment centralization at the population level, with a specific focus on whether
the trend toward centralization is inadvertently widening sociodemographic disparities in cancer
outcomes. We will use a mixed-methods approach as well as an innovative dataset linking cancer
registry and administrative data in two large states (New York and Pennsylvania) over an 11-year
period. We will focus on patients with the most prevalent (i.e., bladder, breast, colorectal, lung,
prostate) and lethal (i.e., brain, esophageal, liver, lung, pancreatic) cancers—these cancers frequently
require complex treatments and have improved outcomes at regional referral centers. In Aim 1, we
will determine the patient characteristics associated with not receiving care at a regional referral
center. In Aim 2, we will examine whether receipt of care at a regional referral center mediates the
relationship between being a traditionally underserved patient (racial/ethnic minority, low-income
individual, rural resident) and quality of care. In Aim 3, we will identify strategies to minimize cancer
disparities in the context of centralization through interviews with key stakeholders. This study is
important because it will provide hospitals, providers, and policymakers with actionable new data on
the ways centralization may be both helping and harming patients, leading to new strategies to
minimize health disparities with implications for interventions and policy changes at multiple levels."

10836515,"Abstract
 The Biostatistics Core (RC3) is one of the four resource cores in the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans
Independence Center (OAIC) at the University of Florida (UF). The mission of the UF OAIC is twofold: 1) to
enhance late-life mobility and independence through interdisciplinary approaches to optimize physical
performance and mobility, and 2) to train new investigators in research on aging, mobility, and independence,
while developing their leadership abilities. The RC3 is a key cog in the interaction among scientists from
diverse disciplines to accomplish this mission. It provides research-design and statistical-analysis resources,
and helps construct data-collection forms and manage the data (including providing quality control) for both
preclinical and clinical studies conducted within the OAIC.
 The RC3 is involved in all phases of the OAIC studies, and it helps with initial pre-proposal study design and
sample-size calculations, development of randomization plans for data collection, and state-of-the-art statistical
analyses once the data are collected. It also helps with manuscript preparation for research dissemination. In
addition, the RC3 serves as a key resource to OAIC new faculty and Research Education Core (REC)
Scholars, by providing them consulting services and periodic special-interest trainings in topics, such as study
design, power analysis, data management, study implementation and management, and basic statistical
methods and tools. Finally, for OAIC studies where the existing biostatistical methodologies are inadequate,
the RC3 has assembled strong expertise for developing new biostatistical methods and tools that are beyond
the current practice."

The older population will more than double from 35 million in 2000 to 72 million in 2030 and comprise almost
20% of the U.S. population. To help preserve older Americans’ mobility and independence, the University of
Florida (UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Research Education Core (REC) promotes the
development of independent investigators in interdisciplinary research on aging related to “promotion of
mobility and independence.” This core emphasizes the competency-based development of research and
leadership skills for conducting high-impact research across the translational spectrum. Key to this approach is
our partnerships with UF’s NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the UF Center for
Advancing Minority Pain and Aging Science (CAMPAS), the Veterans Affairs (VA) Geriatric Research
Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), the Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), and all of
our University colleges. The REC leverages and contributes to other internal and external initiatives providing
career support, including UF resources and programs; NIH and other extramural career-development awards,
diversity supplements, research awards, and fellowships; and CTSI and VA support. The REC supports the
research training of REC Scholars who span the spectrum from beginning trainees (post-doctoral students) to
assistant professors who have not yet obtained funding for major (R01-level) research grants. REC Scholars
receive direct salary support from the REC to protect their time for career development and research. They
also benefit from REC mentorship and training activities, access to other OAIC Core support, and travel
resources. In our first year, we propose to support an interdisciplinary group of four REC Scholars from four
different UF departments (Physical Therapy, Surgery, Aging and Geriatric Research, and Neurology). Among
these REC Scholars, two have clinical degrees and responsibilities; one is a woman. The REC’s overarching
goal is to recruit, select, and train talented REC Scholars committed to advancing translational science and to
integrating clinical insights of health/disease and independence/disability in older adults. Using knowledge of
advances in basic and clinical research findings, REC Scholars will strive to find potential interventions that will
promote mobility and independence in older adults. To facilitate team science and a translational perspective,
we emphasize an interdisciplinary career-development plan supported by a diverse cadre of scientists (basic,
translational, social, behavioral, biostatistics, epidemiological, and clinical). Tailored career-development plans
for each proposed REC-supported Scholar include, but are not limited to: a) a research project integrated with
this OAIC’s theme; b) a formal training strategy that stresses the integration of basic and clinical research and
interactions across the OAIC research spectrum and exploits the resources of the other OAIC Core facilities; c)
a formal mentorship program that uses a team approach to foster translational science approaches; and d) a
monitoring process to evaluate trainees’ progress formally using specific milestones and achievements."
10851467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Microbes have been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis, but definitive knowledge awaits of
the identities of contributing microbes and their biologic effects. There is a critical need to fill this knowledge
gap, because advances in understanding the roles of microbes in CRC pathogenesis will offer new insights
into how CRCs arise and progress along highlighting potential new approaches to prevent and treat CRC by
targeting microbial pathways. It has been reported that selected oral microbes are enriched in the “gut” of
patients with CRC. This finding implicates a potential “oral-gut axis” in CRC. We previously found that oral
inflammation, such as periodontitis, induces aberrant expansion of oral pathobionts, which can translocate to
the distal gastrointestinal tract and ectopically colonize. Consistent with the potential pathogenic role of oral
inflammation in gastrointestinal disease phenotypes, a large human cohort study revealed that periodontal
disease is a risk factor for CRC. A key long-term goal of this project is to define specific oral microbes
associated with CRC and inhibit their contributions to CRC. We have examined the influence of periodontal
inflammation on the development of CRC, using mouse models addressing both periodontitis and CRC. Our
preliminary results demonstrate the following: (i) periodontitis facilitates colonic tumorigenesis in the AOM/DSS
colitis-associated CRC model; (ii) periodontitis leads to the aberrant accumulation of genotoxic bacteria
(colibactin-producing pks+ Escherichia coli) in the oral cavity; (iii) amassed oral genotoxic pks+ E. coli may
translocate to the gut and ectopically colonize; (iv) gut colonization by oral pks+ E. coli promotes the
development of CRC through colibactin; and (v) oral Streptococcus species that co-expand with pks+ E. coli
during periodontal inflammation promote gut colonization by oral pks+ E. coli. Based on these preliminary
results, the overarching hypothesis for this project is that poly-microbial interaction between oral microbes
promotes colonic tumorigenesis. We plan to further explore this hypothesis by pursuing the following two
specific aims: In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which oral bacteria associated with periodontal
inflammation cooperatively promote tumorigenesis in the colon. We hypothesize oral Streptococcus species
promote the colonization of pks+ E. coli in the colonic epithelium, thereby leading to enhanced tumorigenesis.
In Aim 2, we will clarify the role of colibactin in ectopic gut colonization by oral pks+ E. coli. We hypothesize
colibactin is required to maximize the fitness of E. coli during oral inflammation, stability of the bacterium during
niche relocation, and ectopic gut colonization of the bacterium. The completion of the proposed research will
yield impactful insights into how oral pathobionts contribute to CRC pathogenesis and the findings will clarify
how to develop new therapies for CRC prevention and treatment by targeting the oral-gut axis."
10858792,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Despite decades of research on reading disabilities, the efficacy of existing interventions for improving
reading in upper elementary students (Grades 3 – 5) remains limited. This is a significant public health concern
as reading is a strong predictor of lifetime earnings, general health, and overall wellbeing. One significant
limitation of the extant research has been the narrow focus on designing treatments that address solely students’
reading problems without adequately responding to other factors known to impact learning. To enhance the
effectiveness of reading interventions, we propose investigating the benefits of integrating approaches that hold
promise for improving reading outcomes. Attention difficulties are a critical target for such an integrated
intervention, as a substantial proportion of students with reading difficulties (25-40%) experience elevated levels
of inattention, which impedes their response to reading interventions. Despite substantial evidence linking
attention difficulties with reading problems, researchers have largely overlooked attention as a target in reading
interventions. This study is innovative in its approach of integrating evidence-based practices for attention and
reading within a single, unified intervention called Supporting Attention and Reading for Kids (SPARK) for an
understudied population, students with co-occurring reading and attention difficulties in Grades 3 - 5. Our study
will address three specific aims. The primary aim is to evaluate the effects of the SPARK intervention on reading
and attention immediately post-intervention and over time (two subsequent school years). We propose
conducting a randomized control trial with participants assigned to one of three-conditions: SPARK, reading-
only, and a documented typical practice comparison. This proposed 3-arm design will allow for examining the
relative effects of a researcher-provided integrated intervention (reading and attention supports) with a
researcher-provided reading only comparison and then also a typical practice comparison condition. Our second
and third aims will identify factors that influence the strength of the intervention (moderators) and the mechanisms
of action that drive changes in student outcomes (mediators). Collectively, these aims will contribute to
theoretical understanding of the relations between reading, attention, and other related factors (e.g., processing
speed, working memory). The findings will also have significant clinical implications that address a prevailing
and significant public health issue: reading disabilities."
10858816,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The objective of this proposal is to create a new surgical robot to enable women who currently face the life-
long consequences of hysterectomy to have minimally invasive, uterine-sparing interventions. The robot will
deliver needle-sized instruments through an endoscope, enabling independent tissue manipulation, electrosur-
gical probe movement, and visualization, facilitating more precise, accurate, and efficient intrauterine surgery.
Clinical significance comes from the fact that over 50,000 women per year will lose their uterus to fibroids
that elite surgeons have demonstrated can be removed endoscopically. Instrument dexterity limitations prevent
typical surgeons from offering uterine-sparing endoscopy to these women. This results in only 1 in 10 women
benefiting from the minimally invasive endoscopic approach while 2 in 3 face the lifelong negative consequences
of hysterectomy.
Our innovation is to provide the surgeon with two miniature robotic instruments delivered through the endo-
scope, to enhance dexterity and enable two-handed retraction and resection. These instruments are made
from telescoping, curved, elastic tubes. By axially rotating and telescopically extending the tubes, our robot
will provide the surgeon with two tentacle-like instruments small enough to be delivered through standard-sized
endoscopes. These instruments, combined with a variable view angle optic, will enable lateral dexterity and
visualization, countertraction, and accurate and efficient tissue resection.
Our approach consists of three Specific Aims. Aim 1 addresses the design of our new instruments, in con-
junction with the variable view angles provided by our optic, and endowing them with bipolar electrosurgery
capability. Aim 2 focuses on the design of a novel touchscreen-based user interface that enables the surgeon to
simultaneously control the endoscope and the instruments delivered through it. Aim 3 consists of ex vivo and in
vivo animal studies to demonstrate the robot’s ability to reach everywhere in the uterus, to enable surgeons to
perform the procedure who otherwise could not, and to resect FIGO type 0, 1, and 2 fibroids of various sizes from
all relevant locations (the fundal, anterior, posterior, lateral-left, and lateral-right zones) of the uterus efficiently.
The endpoint of this R01 is a device that has been fully validated in established clinical training scenarios and
live animals, setting the stage for clinical translation after the successful completion of this R01."
10858819,"Summary
A nanobody that recognizes immunoglobulin light chains, conjugated to a molecular entity that recognizes a
virus-infected or a cancerous cell, is an effective therapeutic: A single injection of fusion constructs comprising
an anti-kappa light chain nanobody (VHHkappa) and zanamivir, a small molecule that targets influenza
neuraminidase, protects mice from a lethal challenge with both A- and B-strains of influenza. In the model that
established protection by VHHkappa adducts against influenza, the underlying mechanism of action involves
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), but the
relative contribution of each is not known. We shall therefore use FcgR common g chain-deficient mice and C3-
deficient mice to assess the relative contributions of ADCC and CDC. The generation of Fc constructs of different
Ig isotypes and bearing FcR-engagement disabling mutations, similarly modified with zanamivir, will be used to
complement this analysis.
Having established proof-of-concept for influenza and optimized parameters for elimination of influenza virus-
infected cells, we will explore nanobodies that recognize other pathogens (Ebola virus, SARS-CoV-2, HIV) in
combination with VHHkappa in a series of collaborative experiments. The agents to be developed may inspire
novel immunomodulatory therapeutics, to be used as a stand-alone approach, or in combination with approved
drugs. The possibilities of post-exposure prophylaxis against viral infections (Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, HIV) in the
absence of pre-existing immunity, deserve particular emphasis. We shall further enhance the activity of the
proposed VHHkappa fusions through the generation of the corresponding drug adducts, using cytotoxic drugs such
as maytansinoids as compounds that have shown clinical utility. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, SARS-CoV-2)
export viral proteins to the surface of the infected cell during budding. Infected cells can thus be distinguished
from uninfected cells based on the surface display of viral proteins.
We now extend these in vivo observations to fusions of VHHkappa with anti-checkpoint (PD-L1, CTLA-4)
nanobodies. We generated maytansinoid-modified VHHkappa fusions with the anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 VHHs.
Our preliminary data show enhanced anti-tumor activity in the MC38 and B16.F10 mouse tumor models in
comparison with commonly used monoclonal antibodies. However, not all such fusions (examples: fusions of
VHHkappa with nanobodies that recognize Class II MHC or CD8) have shown the intended depletion efficacy in
vivo. This proposal seeks to establish the parameters -including biodistribution and surface expression levels of
the targeted molecules- that determine success or failure of VHHkappa fusions. The availability of VHHs that
recognize human kappa light chains suggest the possibility of clinical translation of this approach."
10861523,"The long-term goal of this project is to define the molecular mechanisms which regulate epigenome
stability during aging and the role of the mammalian sirtuin, SIRT6, in this process. Growing evidence indicates
that epigenome structure becomes compromised with age which may be the root cause of age-related decline
in cell and organ function. SIRT6 emerged as a critical regulator of multiple pathways related to aging such as
genome and epigenome stability, tumorigenesis, inflammation and glycolysis. Additionally, SIRT6
overexpression extends the lifespan of mice.
 Our laboratory has demonstrated that SIRT6 is an upstream regulator of DNA double strand break (DSB)
repair. We demonstrated that SIRT6 is phosphorylated by JNK1/2 in response to oxidative stress on amino acid
S10 and this phosphorylation is required for the stimulation of DSB repair. We have shown that, in addition to
controlling DSB repair, SIRT6 maintains genome stability by repressing transposable elements, and that
oxidative stress causes re-localization of SIRT6 from the promoters of transposable elements to the DNA breaks.
 SIRT6 has two biochemical activities deacetylase (deacetylase) and mono-ADP ribosylase. The function
of SIRT6 deacetylase activity is best characterized. In contrast, mono-ADP ribosylation activity of SIRT6 is much
less studied. Our work has implicated this activity in DNA repair and epigenome stability. Our recent unpublished
data analyzing biochemical functions of a SIRT6 variant found in centenarians, showed that centenarian SIRT6
has reduced deacetylation activity and enhanced mono-ADP ribosylation activity. This suggests that SIRT6
mono-ADP ribosylation activity is important for longevity. Therefore, we set out to identify the function and new
targets of SIRT6 mono-ADP ribosylation. Using mass spectrometry we identified novel targets for SIRT6 mono-
ADP ribosylation including histone H1, H2A, H2A.J, and chromatin remodelers BRG1 and SMARCC2.
Furthermore, we showed that SIRT6-mediated ribosylation of SMARCC2 is required for activation of Nrf2 target
genes in response to oxidative stress.
 Thus, we are ideally positioned to conduct further mechanistic studies of the role of SIRT6 mono-ADP
ribosylation activity in epigenome stability. We will pursue the following specific aims: (1) examine the role of
SIRT6 in maintaining epigenome stability in the context of cellular senescence and aging; (2) examine the
mechanisms of SIRT6 effect on epigenome; specifically, the biological function of H1, H2A, H2A.J, BRG1 and
SMARCC2 mono-ADP ribosylation; and (3) determine the role of SIRT6 mono-ADP ribosylation activity in
epigenome stability and longevity by analyzing the knock-in mouse model which expresses ribosylation deficient
SIRT6 mutation. The proposed research will delineate new pathways regulated by SIRT6, which are relevant to
epigenome stability and aging. As such, we expect that these experiments will reveal critical, new information
about the aging process, and will help to develop new strategies for treating age-related diseases."
10857356,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare cancer with poor prognosis. There have been no FDA-
approved therapies for MPM patients since 2003. Patients with MPM who present with high levels of cytotoxic
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have better survival. To promote TILs in MPM, we developed an adoptive
T-cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). We have developed and translated mesothelin
(MSLN)–targeted CAR T cells to phase I clinical trials (NCT02414269 and NCT02792114). MSLN is a cell-
surface antigen highly expressed in MPM, with very low expression in normal tissues. In our two clinical trials,
no on-target, off-tumor toxicities were noted among 28 patients treated so far. CAR T cells are
administered intrapleurally in NCT02414269, on the basis of our published data (Sci Transl Med 2014) that
established regionally administered CAR T cells potentiate antitumor efficacy by augmenting CD4 T-cell helper
function. Beyond safety, promising antitumor efficacy has been observed in our phase I trial of intrapleural
CAR T cells. Following administration of a low dose of CAR T cells, tumor cells upregulate PD-L1/L2 and
inhibit T cells via binding to PD-1. We have shown that administration of anti-PD-1 agents can overcome
tumor-mediated adaptive resistance and promote CAR T-cell functional persistence (J Clin Inv 2016).
Supported by these data, we treated 11 of 18 MPM patients with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 agent, and
noted no adverse events, and enhanced persistence of CAR T cells and antitumor efficacy.
 Building on these strong data, we propose an investigator-initiated phase I/II clinical trial combining
CAR T-cell therapy with pembrolizumab. We hypothesize that cancer antigen-targeted CAR T cells can
promote TILs and that anti-PD-1 agent can combat adaptive resistance by reversing exhaustion of both CAR
and endogenous T cells. We will determine the safety of adoptive transfer of genetically modified, autologous,
MSLN-targeted T cells into the pleural cavity of MPM patients (with previous administration of
cyclophosphamide), followed by treatment with pembrolizumab until tumor eradication or toxicity (Aim 1). The
primary endpoint is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MSLN-directed CAR T cells
in combination with pembrolizumab (phase I) and to estimate the response rate of the combination therapy
(phase II). We will analyze serially collected pleural fluid, tumor biopsy specimens, and peripheral blood to
assess the ability of PD-1 blockade to reverse CAR T-cell exhaustion (Aim 2) and activate antitumor
endogenous immunity (Aim 3), compared with treatment with pembrolizumab alone. Investigating regional
versus systemic endogenous and CAR T-cell immunity following activation with anti-PD-1 agent, compared
with anti-PD1 agent alone, is mechanistic, innovative, and translational. The ensuing results are directly
applicable to 150,000 patients with pleural metastatic tumors (from MSLN+ve lung and breast cancers) and
extendable to more than 2 million patients with MSLN-expressing solid tumors per year in the U.S. alone."
10857593,"The Pittsburgh Liver Research Center or PLRC was founded in 2016 through intramural support from the
institution and due to a high interest in bringing together scientists and physicians with the common goal of
addressing an increasing burden of liver disease. The long-term objective of PLRC has been to promote
impactful science in understanding the cellular and molecular basis of hepatobiliary injury and repair, with an
eventual goal of improving outcomes in liver diseases in both adult and pediatric populations. Since its inception
in 2016, and NIDDK-funding in 2019, the PLRC has brought together a constituency of individuals with strong
track records in basic and translational liver research. The PLRC is thus a multidisciplinary center that builds on
the historic strengths of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), a leader in the delivery of innovative
and cutting-edge clinical care, and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), a leader in research, discovery, education,
and innovation. Serving as a point of convergence for timely research in liver health and disease, the PLRC
promotes interactions, collaborations and intellectual exchanges between the researchers from various
disciplines as well as between researchers and clinicians to improve the comprehension of complex hepatic
diseases for improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The PLRC provides an integrated platform
to enhance, enrich, and synergize scientific interactions among investigators working in the field of liver
pathobiology who currently reside in diverse departments and institutions at the UPMC and Pitt. This is
accomplished by enabling and fostering multi-, trans- & inter-disciplinary collaborations, providing an optimum
infrastructure for liver research in three key areas, which also are the three Scientific Interest Groups of the
PLRC, i.e. Injury, Repair and Transformation. PLRC is currently composed of 79 all members that consist of 46
full members that form the research base, 4 Pilot & Feasibility members, 9 Leader members and 20 Associate
members. PLRC is administered by the Administrative Core, which enables a seamless integration of various
functions of the PLRC through optimal organization of the PLRC. The Admin Core has also formed alliances with
other centers and institutes within and outside Pitt to provide additional resources and opportunities to the PLRC
members. PLRC offers 4 state-of-the-art Biomedical Research Cores- the Advanced Cell and Tissue Imaging
Core, the Clinical Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core, the Genomics and Systems Biology Core and
the Human Synthetic Liver Biology Core. PLRC is highly invested in next-generation of liver-focused
investigators by providing research funding, mentoring and access to research infrastructure to help promote
their independent career in academic medicine. Eventually, PLRC serves as a platform for continued education
while promoting scientific exchange and collaborations among members to eventually bridge the void between
basic research and clinical practice. Thus, the PLRC serves its multi-faceted mission of discerning complex
tribulations in hepatic health and disease by enabling innovative, collaborative multi-disciplinary research in the
highly relevant area of cellular and molecular basis of hepatobiliary injury and repair. We firmly believe that
discerning fundamental cellular and molecular processes of common liver pathologies that remain major unmet
clinical needs through team or individual investigator led research, supported by optimal infrastructure, resources
and enrichment is critical for successful translation and impact."

In response to the expanding need for multiplexed high-resolution imaging in biomedical research conducted at
Massachusetts General Hospital, we are requesting funds to purchase a Leica Stellaris 8 Falcon confocal
microscope for the Imaging Platform of the Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases (CIID).
This instrument will modernize this Imaging Platform by replacing an aging LSM 780 confocal microscope that
is no longer fully supported by its manufacturer Zeiss as of 2022.
The CIID Imaging Platform is directed by Dr. Thorsten Mempel (since 2007) with support by the microscopy
equipment manager Dr. Natalie Andrew (since 2019). In addition to the LSM 780 and a Zeiss Axioscan slide
scanner it includes a Bruker Ultima IV multiphoton microscope and an Olympus MPE-RS multiphoton
microscope. The CIID is a nexus for investigators with interest in Immunology and its Imaging Platform has a
wide user base not only from CIID laboratories, but also research groups in other departments and centers
located on the MGH research campus, including Pathology, Cancer Center, Neurology, Cardiology, Pulmonary
Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Nephrology, Transplantation Biology, Systems Biology, Surgery, the Martinos
Imaging Center, and others. Collectively, its user base has outstanding expertise in a spectrum of imaging
modalities, including fluorescence lifetime imaging, which is an integral feature of the Stellaris 8 Falcon.
The Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscope incorporates a number of recent technological advances that extend
its capabilities to make it ideally suited to meet the demands of NIH funded research projects directed by the
user group described in this application. These include the pulsed white light laser providing 8 individual, freely
tunable laser lines which, together with the prism-based spectral detection system, allows for ultimate flexibility
and efficiency both in the discrete excitation and detection of a large number of spectrally similar
fluorochromes not achievable with any other current commercial system. The pulsed laser further endows the
Stellaris 8 with fluorescence lifetime imaging capability integrated into turn-key modalities for additional
channel multiplexing (up to 11) or for the FALCON dedicated fast FLIM imaging modality. Together with its
multicolor super-resolution capability achieved by adaptive image reconstruction (LIGHTENING), increased
spatial coverage, and the superior detection sensitivity of Leica's proprietary HyD detectors, the instrument will
have a transformative impact on NIH funded research at our institution. The long-term objective of this
application is to maintain the ability of the CIID Imaging Platform to provide cutting-edge imaging capabilities to
its user community and allow them to remain competitive at a time when advances in imaging technology
enable unprecedented insights into the organization of tissues at the molecular and cellular scale."

10843921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This study will use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling statistical framework to obtain rates of new
cancer cases and cancer deaths at the ZIP-code level, which will allow cancer control
researchers and practitioners to focus their efforts on populations at greatest risk. The Bayesian
hierarchical model will produce small area estimates by borrowing strength from neighboring
ZIP-codes as well as over time. Typically, the ZIP-code levels would need to be combined to
much larger regions to obtain sample sizes big enough to either de-identify individuals or
stabilize the variance, or both. We employ a zero-inflated model since many ZIP-codes will have
small and especially zero counts in a given year and age group. Given that the challenges of,
and needs for, calculating small area cancer estimates is greatest in rural areas, we will focus
on the largely rural states of Iowa, Kentucky, and New Mexico. We will then construct user
friendly maps and other interactive graphics that can be tailored and included on cancer
control/public health websites and develop communication and educational materials to promote
the use of these maps for cancer control purposes. The result is an interactive visualization
approach that displays age-adjusted cancer rates, risk of cancer relative to the state average,
and levels of confidence, all at the small area ZIP-code level even for rural areas with small and
zero counts. The probabilities and cancer risk estimates will be disseminated through a widely
available platform that is easy to use and understand."
10839880,"Project Summary 
Maladaptive fear exacerbates responses to aversive stimuli and enhances stress and anxiety. However, brain mechanisms that drive these aversive responses and enhance salience of aversive stimuli are not known. The excitatory peptide substance P produces a spatially restricted, glutamatergic long-term potentiation on a subset of Nucleus Accumbens core neurons that are known to promote aversion. Furthermore, this long-term potentiation occurs in the Nucleus Accumbens core following fear conditioning and can be suppressed by blocking substance P signaling. Glutamatergic inputs, particularly limbic inputs, to this sub-region are among several brain systems that encode salience to cues, suggesting substance P may drive integration of salience-related signals on these cells to promote learning about aversive stimuli that proceeds behavioral action. Using a multi-level approach including slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, and fiber photometry, this project aims to understand how substance P-mediated potentiation of saliencerelated inputs to the nucleus accumbens core promotes salience to cues predicting aversive outcomes and aims to develop brain stimulation paradigms to suppress fear responding."
10841847,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) is a particularly aggressive form of chronic rejection post-lung
transplantation, marked by an extremely poor prognosis (median survival of < 1 year) and little therapeutic
options. Pathogenesis of RAS remains elusive although association with donor specific antibodies and antibody
mediated rejection have been found in human studies. We have recently characterized a murine lung transplant
model which recapitulates the histologic changes of RAS and establishes the requisite role of humoral immune
response in its development. A unique feature noted in the murine RAS lung allograft was the presence of
activated B cells, plasmablasts, and fully differentiated plasma cell (PCs). PCs were also identified in human
RAS lungs suggesting that a rejecting lung serves as an inflammatory local niche for humoral immune responses.
These antibody secreting cells (ASCs) localized along the bronchovascular bundles (BVBs) and sub-pleural
space, lying in close association with expanding mesenchymal cells (MCs). The key role of specialized stromal
cells, via paracrine factors of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) and interleukin (IL)-6, in
establishment of a stable survival niche for ASCs is well recognized across a variety of lymphoid and
hematopoietic tissues. We have recently characterized the in situ niche of a subpopulation of lung-resident
mesenchymal cells which expand and contribute to fibroproliferation in a RAS allograft. This
Foxf1+/Gli1+/Scal1+/Col1+ mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) population forms a three dimensional network
along the bronchovascular bundle (BVB-MSCs). Our new preliminary data demonstrates that these cells are the
high CXCL12/IL-6 expressing population, and lie in close apposition to ASCs in the rejecting lung allograft. A
novel mechanism of upregulation of CXCL12 expression in BVB-MSCs by IL-6 transsignaling and downstream
JAK/Stat activation, with recruited monocytes contributing to the soluble IL-6R, was identified. In this proposal
we will investigate an innovative and novel hypothesis of paracrine signaling between this graft-resident
mesenchymal stromal cell population and immune cells and the role of IL-6 transsignaling/CXCL12 axis in
regulating the humoral inflammatory niche in a rejecting lung. The proposed experiments will utilize our ability to
identify and conditionally target the specific BVB-MSC subpopulation, and the novel orthotropic whole lung
transplant model of RAS to elucidate the spatial in vivo niche of APCs, its temporal regulation by CXCl12
expressing BVB-MSCs, and its functional significance in the pathogenesis of RAS (Aim 1). The role of IL-6 and
IL-6 trans-signaling in cellular communication between resident MCs and infiltrating immune cells within this
niche and the pathogenesis of RAS will be determined (Aim 2). The effect of specific drugs targeting humoral
cell responses and IL-6 signaling pathway will be tested in the murine lung allograft model of RAS (Aim 3).
Together these studies will offer novel mechanistic insight into lung allograft failure and provide pre-clinical
information regarding role of therapeutic modalities targeting humoral immune responses in RAS."
10841793,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Cation-coupled secondary active transporters play critical roles in many aspects of cell physiology,
and pharmacokinetics, and are also involved in many serious diseases. Based upon decades of effort in
structural biology and biochemistry, we now know the architecture, folding, substrate binding, and global
conformational change of many transporters. However, for many transporters, we still have a deeply
incomplete understanding of transport mechanisms. Critically, many important mammalian transporters
remain structurally and functionally uncharacterized. My laboratory has been working on fundamental
questions of cation-coupled sugar symport using a prototype bacterial transporter, the Na+-coupled
melibiose symporter MelB. In the past 5 years, we have achieved important milestones, including the
determination of MelB structures in two distinct kinetic states with bound sugar or Na+ and the
construction of novel mechanisms of symport utilizing structural, functional, biochemical, and biophysical
methods. By further applying and extending these successful methods in the next 5 years, we will expand
our research to include the study of the mammalian Na+-coupled epithelial amino acid co-transporter
SLC6A14, involved in several chronic diseases, including cancer. Significantly, we have made critical
breakthroughs and have succeeded in the expression, purification, and functional reconstitution of
SLC6A14. The use of purified SLC6A14 is a critical complement for validating the published data from
cell-based assays where other amino acid transporters may be present. For cryoEM-single particle
analysis, we will develop suitable fiducial tools to increase structure determination throughput; these tools
will be of great utility to the more general membrane protein structural biology community. Our SLC6A14
structures, combined with results from other approaches we regularly utilize, will provide insight into its
broad substrate specificity and inhibitory mechanisms by its inhibitor, an important input for potential
inhibitor development. For MelB, we will further examine our proposed cooperative binding-based core
symport mechanism by determining missing key structure(s) and analyzing conformational dynamics
using hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations. We will
stabilize MelB at specific state(s) using nanobodies or binding proteins obtained from different scaffolds
and will determine their structures by cryoEM. Biochemically, these stabilized states will uniquely enable
a better understanding of relationships between substrate binding and conformational dynamics. The
expected new structures and functional studies of both Na+-coupled nutrient symporters SLC6A14 and
MelB will provide critical novel knowledge about the molecular basis of ion-coupled transport and coupling
mechanisms. This research can significantly impact the development of new therapeutic strategies for a
broad range of chronic diseases including cancer.

For this P01, we have built frameworks for terabytes of data and built agile interfaces for the interpretation of
these data across five aims: (Aim 1) generate primary sequence data, run quality control (QC) assessment of
sequence data, perform alignment, and analyze the genomics and transcriptomic data generated in the projects,
(Aim 2) produce epigenomic data (RRBS, WGBS, Cut&Run, scATAC/RNA-seq, and hmC-profiling) and guide
analysis for clonality inference and interpretation using our open-source algorithms, (Aim 3) perform integrative
characterization of samples, organize and back-up data for public release, and provide a centralized server
environment for P01, (Aim 4) provide statistical designs, including experimental configurations, sample sizes,
and power calculations, for all research projects, (Aim 5) provide data analysis, generate statistical reports for
all projects, and assist project investigators in publishing scientific results.
Across all aims, we will help guide integrative analysis of the data, coordinate data release (SRA, dbGAP), aid
with manuscript and statistical interpretation, and create a Lymphoma Epigenomics Portal for the P01 and data
broader data access."
10845063,"Project Summary
 The Oklahoma ACE (OACE) aims to understand autoimmune disease biology through interdisciplinary,
collaborative research integrating clinical and basic questions. Prior OACE work as both a Basic and Clinical
ACE has significantly advanced our understanding of autoimmune disease genetics, development, flare, and
heterogeneity. The OACE has also contributed to eight ACE trials, serving as a Protocol Chair and/or a lead
recruitment site for five while also building unique patient cohorts and data/sample collections from diverse
urban, rural, and minority communities. Through this UM1 Clinical ACE submission, the OACE strives to
deconstruct the molecular heterogeneity of autoimmune disease to implement more effective clinical trial
designs, optimize biologically relevant treatment selection, and improve disease understanding.
 Our primary clinical project builds on our extensive prior work demonstrating a role for EBV reactivation
in SLE disease transition, disease activity, and activation of interferon pathways. Utilizing our innovative SLE
trial design that provides temporary steroids to allow background immunosuppressants withdrawal, we will test
the effectiveness of EBV vaccination in suppressing disease activity and interferon responses in biomarker-
selected SLE patients. Partnered mechanistic studies will test the impact of EBV reactivation on autoantibody
production and B cell and monocyte activation and function in patients. Preliminary data in our alternate
clinical project has found a critical role of the type I IFN pathway in neuromyelitis optica, a complex
autoimmune disease with up to 40% of patients have continual relapse and damage even with standard-of-
care treatment. We have found that high type I IFN signatures are associated with irreversible disability after
an NMO relapse and increased B and Th17 cell signature activation. This first-in-NMO study will assess the
effectiveness and safety of the type I IFN receptor antagonist anifrolumab in NMO. Mechanistic studies will
determine changes in type I IFN, B cell, and Th17 responses and autoantibody production. Our collaborative
project deconstructs molecular heterogeneity and associated pathogenic mechanisms of SLE. Building on
preliminary data using multi-omic machine learning to predict abatacept treatment response at baseline, we will
distinguish determinants of belimumab treatment in SLE patients initially using deep immunophenotyping,
epigenetics, and transcriptomics, evolving to include single-cell technologies as necessary, to capture the
biology that determines treatment response. New with this renewal, we propose our OMRF CAP-certified
Biorepository to serve as the ACE Biorepository Core, leveraging decades of experience as an autoimmune
disease biorepository, dedicated personnel, standard policies/procedures, and high biobanking standards. Our
Administrative Core will support an Autoimmune Disease Enrichment Program and Scholars Program and
assist with these clinical and collaborative projects. The OACE will also continue to recruit for ACE Network
trials and collaborate with other ACE Centers to advance scientific discoveries that improve patient lives."
10847994,"CORE 3_MULTIPARAMETER IMAGING AND PATHOLOGY: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One basic function of Core 3 includes the collection and distribution of specimens and patient samples to P01
investigators. Importantly, we have been acquiring blood and tissue samples from most diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with standard of care therapy at MDACC since 2007 and at WCMC since
1993. The two hematopathologists co-directing this core (Drs. Patel and Vega) will ensure proper tissue
collection, provide pathologic characterization of all lymphoma tumors, and will work closely with the project
investigators to address the needs of the projects. In addition, Core 3 has developed methods in both institutions
to ensure the optimal utilization of limited tissue resources by creating tissue derivatives (e.g. tissue microarrays,
RNA, DNA) that can serve multiple P01 projects. These tissue derivatives are suitable for the identification and
validation of molecular markers that may contribute to lymphoma progression and disease resistance. These
tissue resources will also facilitate establishing relevant clinical correlation necessary for prognostication and
identification of new biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.
The use of common specimens among multiple projects requires the services of an information system to contain
and organize results of tests performed on a given sample so that duplication of assays is avoided, and
multidisciplinary interactions are facilitated. Therefore, Core 3 is also responsible for generating a data repository
for all biospecimens collected, in collaboration with Core 1 (Lymphoma Model Systems) and Core 2 (Biostatistics
and Computational Biology), the information in which provides a detailed characterization of clinically annotated
tissue samples. The bank is fully annotated and linked to a lymphoma outcomes database in both institutions
that captures information on basic demographics, diagnosis, clinical prognostic factors, treatment history, and
treatment outcome for each patient. This allows selecting samples with any combination of molecular,
cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, clinical, and response data for laboratory studies.
In addition to providing the infrastructure for a uniform pathology review and classification of clinical specimens
used in the P01 projects - using conventional histomorphologic, immunohistochemical and molecular techniques
and generating a pathology image library available to all P01 investigators at both institutions - Core 3 will also
develop and provide a variety of imaging services critical to successful molecular analysis of mouse and human
LBCL. To this end, the Core 3 will perform routine and highly multiplexed immunohistochemical (IHC) and
immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and spatial transcriptomic profiling, with state-of-the-art technology.
Core 3 incorporates several innovative features including a secure database shared by both institutions
comprising comprehensive diagnostic pathologic information linked with individual patient clinical and molecular
data, and the establishment of novel technologies for cellular imaging. These features are among others that
will enable Core 3 to facilitate the P01 projects achieving their intended goals."
10844852,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Species-specific differences and the complexity of cellular interactions involved in human pain perception have
created challenges relying on conventional preclinical rodent models or simple human pluripotent stem cell
(hPSC)-derived nociceptor models for novel drug development. Pain signaling pathways comprise of multiple
neuronal, glial, and immune cell types within the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS), but the
contributions of these cells in pain sensation is still under investigation. Moreover, these cells and the circuits
they form exhibit region-specific characteristics, with unique positional identities along the body axis, and
require a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment with component parts—including end-organ tissues— to
establish appropriate connectivity, plasticity, excitability, and functionality.
Recognizing these challenges, the goal of this project is to bridge the gap by developing advanced
stem cell tools to facilitate the creation of comprehensive and region-specific models for studying
afferent pain circuitry. Building upon established technologies for region-specific spinal cord differentiation
within my lab, this project will pursue three main objectives. Objective 1 involves developing scalable and
systematic methods to generate region-specific sensory neurons and glial subtypes. Objective 2 focuses on
creating and characterizing region-specific somatosensory organoids that faithfully mimic the in vivo
microenvironment. Objective 3 aims to integrate hPSC-derived pain circuits into two tissue-engineered models
for women's health—breast cancer metastasis and endometriosis— to determine how region- and subtype-
specificity impacts innervation in the context of health and disease.
Altogether, we will produce a suite of region-specific cells, circuits, and tissues that will deepen our
understanding of the unique pain networks along the body axis and expedite the development of model
systems for high-throughput screening of targeted analgesics. Furthermore, as a new investigator with
multidisciplinary interests, this New Innovator Award will advance technologies in our lab that can be applied
beyond pain research to a broad range of applications in neurological diseases, tissue engineering, and
regenerative medicine."

10846062,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The University of Washington (UW) Molecular Biophysics Training Program (MBTP) is designed to
train predoctoral students to apply state-of-art physical and quantitative approaches to the
investigation of biomedically relevant systems at molecular and cellular levels. As manifested by the
COVID-19 pandemic crisis, basic and translational research in almost all biomedical areas
necessitate the adoption and implementation of rigorous and quantitative biophysical methods to
dissect the fundamental mechanisms of molecular and cellular biology and to develop effective
therapeutics against a variety of existing and emerging human diseases. This requirement calls for a
highly trained workforce proficient in research methods at the intersection of physics, chemistry,
engineering, and biology. The overarching objective of MBTP is to meet these needs by enhancing
the research experience and training of holistically selected UW predoctoral students interested in
molecular biophysics and preparing them for a productive career in health-related research in
academia, government, and the private sector. Each year MBTP trainees are chosen through a
rigorous selection process that identifies promising graduate students from a large pool of talented
and diverse applicants admitted to UW through five interdisciplinary programs and nine departmental
programs. During their graduate career, 10-12 MBTP trainees are provided with at least two years of
mandatory structured activities to expose them to a wide range of biophysical methods, techniques,
and research topics that go beyond their home graduate program. These training activities include,
but are not limited to, a structural biology and biophysics graduate level course, a bi-weekly student
research presentation series, a peer-organized student journal club and discussion group, an annual
retreat trainee-centered retreat, and interactions with a larger local biophysics community. These
activities are further supplemented with lectures and courses required or supported by MBTP and
related UW departments. MBTP plays a special role at UW by actively nucleating a cross-
departmental biophysics community. It fosters close interactions among trainees and their peer pre-
doctoral students, who share common interests in molecular biophysics, but are otherwise separated
by departments and graduate programs. By taking advantage of a growing body of UW faculty with
biophysics background, MBTP creates a unique platform, where trainees learn about modern
biophysical techniques, sharpen their communication skills, build and extend their professional
network, establish and enhance their science identity and self-efficacy. The training program has a
strong record of success and impact as evidenced by the diverse research-related career choices
trainees make after they leave graduate school."
10846155,"Project Summary
This goal of this R21 project is to jumpstart mechanistic research on the role in neuropathic pain of SCN1B, an
understudied druggable protein. Neuropathic pain is a debilitating, chronic condition that represents a major
medical burden in the US. Current standards of care are ineffective both for preventing pain chronicity after nerve
injury, and for providing long-term relief for neuropathic pain. Individuals show different susceptibilities to
neuropathic pain and experience diverse sensory symptoms; however, little is known about the genetic factors
that predispose individuals to chronic sensory dysfunction. Thus, there is a need to understand the mechanisms
that that underlie neuropathic pain, because such molecules are potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers of
susceptibility. In a screen for natural genetic variation among genetically distinct mouse strains, we identified
Scn1b as a top candidate susceptibility gene for tactile hypersensitivity in a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced
neuropathic pain (PIPN). The Scn1b gene encodes the auxiliary β1 subunit of voltage-gated Na+ channels,
which are key regulators of neuronal excitability because they mediate the upstroke of the action potential.
Scn1b expression is highly enriched in myelinated mechanosensory neurons that provide sensory drive for tactile
allodynia in persistent pain. Based on these results, this project’s central hypothesis is that SCN1B plays a key
role in the development of tactile allodynia in mouse models of neuropathic pain by governing the excitability of
mechanosensory neurons. This hypothesis will be tested with a combination of sensory neuron-specific Scn1b
knockout mice, electrophysiological studies and a battery of behavioral tests for somatosensory and motor
behaviors. Aims are to: 1) determine whether Scn1b is a susceptibility factor for neuropathic pain in a mouse
CIPN model; and 2) determine whether Scn1b is required for the development of neuropathic pain in a spared-
nerve injury model. If successful, this research will generate essential pilot data that will rapidly catalyze future
research to elucidate mechanisms through which Scn1b promote neuropathic pain, develop SCN1B as a new
therapeutic target, and validate Scn1b as a biomarker for neuropathic-pain susceptibility."
10847547,"Project Summary
The goal of Project 1 is to demonstrate that disturbed endothelial copper (Cu) metabolism drives endothelial
dysfunction and atherosclerosis by integrating excess glycolysis and mitochondrial (mito)ROS-epigenetic
crosstalk. Cardiovascular risk factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and diabetes contribute to
endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. By contrast, aerobic glycolysis regulated by glycolytic enzymes
including PFKFB3 is required for normal endothelial cell (EC) function and its dysregulation contributes to
endothelial dysfunction. However, the key mechanisms linking EC metabolism, ROS, and atherosclerosis remain
unclear. Cu, an essential micronutrient, is highly increased in human atherosclerosis, but its role is controversial,
based on Cu chelation and optimal dietary Cu intake studies. Since excess Cu is toxic, Cu bioavailability is tightly
controlled by Cu transporting ATPase (ATP7A). However, the role of endothelial ATP7A and its molecular
linkage with Cu metabolism, oxidative stress, and glycolysis involved in atherosclerosis are entirely unknown.
Preliminary data show that ATP7A expression was dramatically decreased in mouse atherosclerotic aorta or
human ECs exposed to pro-atherogenic disturbed flow. Unexpectedly, ATP7A knockdown in human ECs with
bulk RNAseq indicated induction of the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) which promotes EC
dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, loss of ATP7A in ECs increased [Cu]i, which in turn promoted
excess PFKFB3/glycolysis-ROS axis as well as mitoROS-mediated upregulation of histone demethylase
JMJD2B-TGF2-Snail axis to induce EndMT. In vivo, inducible EC-specific ATP7A-/-(iEC-ATP7A-/-)/ApoE-/- mice
showed induction of EndMT and enhanced atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that endothelial ATP7A
dysfunction drives EndMT by orchestrating the PFKFB3-glycolysis-ROS axis as well as epigenetic
reprogramming via mitoROS-JMJD2B axis in a Cu-dependent manner, leading to Snail induction, which
in turn accelerates atherosclerosis. Aim 1 will determine whether endothelial ATP7A dysfunction drives
EndMT in a Cu-, glycolysis- and ROS-dependent manner in cultured ECs and address underlying mechanisms.
Aim 2 will determine whether endothelial ATP7A dysfunction accelerates EndMT and atherosclerosis in a Cu-,
glycolysis- and ROS-dependent manner in vivo. We will use newly developed iEC-ATP7A-/-/EC-tracing mTmG
mice, highly innovative CRISPR/Cas9-generated knock-in mutant mice that reduce glycolysis in the endothelium
(iEC-Glyco-Lo), iEC-Cu importer Ctr1-/- or Pfkfb3-/- mice, carotid partial ligation to induce atherosclerosis,
compartment-specific redox-sensitive biosensors, and transcriptomics and metabolomics. Highly innovative ICP-
Mass Spec and X-ray fluorescence microscopy will be used to analyze Cu metabolism in cells and tissues. Our
proposal will provide new insights into targeting excess Cu-glycolysis-ROS (mitoROS) axis or enhancing
endothelial ATP7A function as new therapeutic approaches for treatment of various cardiovascular diseases.
Project 1 is highly dependent on the expertise and support provided by other Projects and Cores of this PPG."

10856815,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uveitis is an inflammatory eye disease that confers severe ocular morbidity and can cause long term blindness
if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Current challenges exist in the diagnosis of infectious cases due to
inadequate clinical laboratory methods to establish the exact cause and the current sample volume
requirement for multiple analysis. Technological advancements with high-throughput sequencing have
improved diagnostic strategies in medicine and are enabling the detection of several types of infectious
organisms. Additionally, biomarker discovery is lacking in uveitis. Herein we propose a collaboration with
stakeholders both local and international to enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of uveitis to
improve upon uveitis classification, diagnosis, biomarker identification, and deepen our understanding of the
host response with the following aims. In the first aim we will perform worldwide surveillance of pathogens
causing uveitis, identify geographic trends, and assess the effect of pathogen class and antimicrobial
resistance on visual outcomes. We expect we will identify known and unknown causes of infectious uveitis
using metagenomic sequencing and that the organisms will vary by geographic locale and seasonality. Visual
outcomes will vary by pathogen class. In the second aim we will characterize the host gene expression profiles
in infectious uveitis and determine what profiles predict clinical outcomes. We will identify host transcriptome
signatures that will vary by pathogen class and determine the profiles implicated in clinical outcomes. In the
last aim we will interrogate the tears for noninvasive biomarker discovery using the proteome and metabolomic
signatures. These aims combine the characterization of pathogens, host transcriptomes, and the tear
proteome and metabolite signatures to provide a comprehensive molecular approach to improve the diagnosis
of uveitis. We will leverage international collaborators to use newer laboratory techniques with unbiased RNA
deep sequencing and mass spectrometry. This will contribute to further our understanding of the eye as a
surveillance site for infectious diseases and is paramount for establishing disease causality and will impart
knowledge and data into public health priorities, programs, and policy."
10895491,"Emerging evidence suggests that individual differences in cognitive aging unfold across a lifetime; however,
relatively little is known as to how early life versus proximal influences accumulate to impact cognitive
functioning across midlife. The Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan behavioral development and
cognitive aging (CATSLife) seeks a greater understanding of the environmental and genetic factors that drive
increasing divergence in cognitive maintenance. CATSLife comprises the prospective Colorado Adoption
Project (CAP) and parallel Longitudinal Twin Study (LTS), now tested at ages 28-45 years (CATSLife1). We
propose a 5-year follow-up of 1400 adoptive and nonadoptive probands, siblings, and twins as they navigate
the transition to midlife at ages 33-50 years (CATSLife2). Whereas CATSLife1 established baseline
performance as participants prepare for transitions to midlife, CATSLife2 proposes to evaluate stability and
change across the midlife transition. Further, we propose to integrate the prospective Twins Early
Development Study (TEDS) with a new assessment of 5000 twins at age 28 years, allowing us to build on over
20 years of prior data collection, including genome-wide genotyping, to explore similar predictors of cognitive
maintenance. As participants transition to midlife, we will leverage powerful design features and a wealth of
prospective data collected from infancy through adulthood, including a full adoption design, to examine causal
implications of early environmental risk and protective factors, and a twin design to examine environmental
factors that may have causal influence on cognition, controlling for familial confounds. As we leverage data
from prior assessments with CATSLife1, the opportunity to investigate the transition across midlife with
CATSLife2 is ideal. We will use our twin/adoption design with polygenic score data (PGS), detailed cognitive
batteries, physical health, proposed biomarkers of accelerated aging that may participate in immune-
inflammatory and neurotransmitter pathways, and neighborhood features to shed light on risk-resilience factors
that account for midlife cognitive stability and change. This integrated follow-up study of CATSLife and TEDS
aims to: 1) Evaluate individual differences in stability and change of cognitive abilities in midlife, considering
cognitive reserve pathways vis-a-vis genetic and genetically mediated environmental influences; 2) Evaluate
genetic factors with lifestyle and health behaviors that predict cognitive stability and change, considering early
life reserve and genetic moderation; 3) Evaluate biomarkers of accelerated aging as predictors and mediators
of cognitive stability and change, uniquely characterizing biomarker patterns and change at the midlife
transition; and 4) Evaluate stressful and buffering contextual factors that predict cognitive stability and change,
addressing individual socio-demographics and neighborhood features, accounting for active (rGE) selection.
The findings from this proposed CATSLife/TEDS follow-up study could substantially increase our
understanding of the genetic and environmental etiologies of individual differences in cognitive aging."
10855751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging can be defined as the progressive gradual decline in physiological function. It is the major risk factor for
human pathologies that lead to disease, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a better understanding of aging and
the processes that affect lifespan at the molecular level remains an important problem in modern biology and
medicine. Recent observations have highlighted a potential new process as a possible driver of aging and age-
associated disease. As an organism ages, retrotransposon mRNA expression increases. What is lacking, at this
point, is an understanding of how this retrotransposon expression can cause aging and aging-related
phenotypes.
Drosophila has long served as a very useful model system to understand the molecular underpinnings of aging.
In addition to a relatively short lifespan, Drosophila has well-developed genetic tools and a long history of
observations of the effects of age on the organism. To complement this is a long history of work to understand
transposon biology in this organism. This makes Drosophila particularly well-suited to set up a new model to
understand the role of retrotransposon activity in aging and aging-related phenotypes. The goals of this project
are to set up and characterize a Drosophila system to understand whether transposon activity is a cause or effect
of aging."
10856163,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 The interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) secreted by photoreceptors (PRs) is large (135-kD)
and the most abundant soluble protein in the inter-PR matrix (IPM). Mutations and reduced expression of IRBP
cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP), childhood-onset retinal dystrophy with high-myopia (CRDHM), cornea curvature,
or increased susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy with unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Our newly generated
knock-in (KI) model of RP demonstrated that the equivalent mouse mutation (D1078N) abolished secretion of
IRBP from the PRs of the KI mouse. The D1078N IRBP was exclusively localized to the PR inner segments (IS)
including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and formed insoluble high molecular complexes (HMC) via the
disulfide bonds. The abundance of IRBP were dramatically reduced in the KI retina, possibly due to the ER-
associated degradation (ERAD) of the D1078N IRBP in the PRs. The KI mouse recapitulated many disease
phenotypes of the D1080N-caused RP patients, including progressive degeneration of rods & cones, aberrant
visual cycle, delayed rod dark adaptation, and significantly diminished visual function of rods, M- & S-cones.
Importantly, we were able to rescue the function of the RP (D1080N)- & CRDHM (E1152x)-associated IRBP
mutants in the preliminary studies. To capitalize on these findings, we will accomplish three specific aims in this
proposal. In Aim-1, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which D1080N mutation causes severe defect in
secretion & stability of IRBP. Through computational analysis, we have identified several amino acid (AA)
residues that may contribute to the secretory defect of D1080N IRBP. An AA substitution in one of these identified
AAs rescued the secretion & function of the mutant IRBP. We will test whether AA substitutions in the other
identified AAs can also rescue secretion, stability & function of the D1080N IRBP. We will also define the
mechanisms causing ERAD of IRBP and death of PRs in the KI mice. In Aim-2, we will further characterize and
expand our preliminary findings that can rescue the function of E1152x IRBP in cultured cells. Using a mouse
model, we will then analyze the pathological mechanisms of the truncated IRBP that causes early loss of cone-
& rod-mediated vision in children with the E1152x mutation. In Aim-3, we will test pharmacological interventions
that may alleviate retinal degeneration & vision loss in the D1078N KI mouse model of RP. Through preliminary
studies, we have identified small compounds that either rescue secretion & stability of D1080N IRBP in vitro or
improve survival & function of rods & cones in Irbp-/- mice. We will test if these compounds improve secretion &
function of D1078N IRBP as well as survival & function of PRs in the KI mice. To elucidate the in vivo action
mechanisms of the compounds, we will also analyze the visual cycle, bis-retinoid formation, unfolded protein
responses (UPR), oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death pathways in the KI retina. The results of these
studies will provide a knowledge basis for the development of safe & effective therapeutic strategy for patients
with IRBP mutations, aberrant visual cycle & oxidative or ER stress implicated in many forms of retinal diseases."
10856232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is largely determined by the accumulation of demyelinating lesions
in the spinal cord (SC), but conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods lack the sensitivity to
assess the full extent of SC pathology including sub-radiological tissue damage that occurs beyond MRI-visible
lesions. Recent studies have revealed that cervical SC pathology correlates with disability in MS and is
independent from MRI measures of disease in the brain. However, a lack of evidence on disease in the
lumbosacral spinal cord (LSC) has limited our ability to fully understand primary progressive MS (PPMS)
pathology and how LSC lesions and diffuse damage impact clinical disability and autonomic function, which
hinders the selection and evaluation of therapies for patients. Advancing multimodal MRI and developing
imaging biomarkers of PPMS targeting the LSC will deliver more accurate assessments of disease
progression, enabling and informing decisions regarding treatment with disease-modifying therapies or
symptom management strategies. Our long-term goal is to develop MRI biomarkers of MS pathology for the
complete SC. We predict that MRI measures of the entire spinal axis will better inform clinicians on the extent
of disease, which will likely dictate therapy. Our project objective is to identify and validate quantitative MRI
biomarkers in the lower SC that are associated with clinical disability in PPMS. Our previous work
demonstrated that advanced MRI methods (diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative magnetization transfer MRI,
and resting-state functional MRI) provide measures related to pathology in the cervical and lumbar SC in
relapsing-remitting MS, and we will now study the extent of imaging abnormalities in the LSC by applying these
advanced MRI methods in PPMS. We also extend advanced MRI to the conus and cauda equina to explore
associations between imaging indices and autonomic dysfunction seen in PPMS patients. Our specific aims
are: (1) Establish reproducibility and validate quantitative MRI indices in the LSC, (2) Characterize quantitative
MRI biomarkers of disease pathology in the LSC for PPMS in relation to clinical disability, and (3) Optimize the
resolution of quantitative MRI methods to extend their application to the conus medullaris and cauda equina.
This research is technically innovative because it refines advanced MRI methods for application in the LSC; to
our knowledge, this will be the first application of these methods to the conus and cauda equina. The resulting
novel, quantitative MRI biomarkers of PPMS pathology in these structures will complement existing brain and
cervical SC MRI in monitoring disease progression and treatment response. The results will improve our
understanding of the pathological substrates of disability in PPMS, which is expected to have a significant
impact on future studies of potential therapies. The MRI methods will also benefit studies of other neurological
disorders, and this research aligns with NINDS’s mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease by
developing imaging biomarkers that enable more precise assessment of disease biology."

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. Inhaled asbestos fibers
become embedded in the lining of the lungs, causing harmful inflammation of the pleura and resulting in MPM.
Most patients with MPM die within a year after diagnosis as MPM is quite resistant to therapy. Most patients
receive standard chemotherapy with cisplatin/pemetrexed combination which only extends survival by an
average of about 11 weeks. Alternative therapies have failed to significantly extend survival until 2021, when the
FDA approved the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), nivolumab and ipilimumab, as an
alternative first-line treatment for MPM. ICI’s harness a patient’s own immune system to fight MPM cancer cells.
ICI’s have extended the life expectancy of some patients by about four months compared to traditional
chemotherapy regimens. For patients with tumor limited to one side of the chest, surgical resection with
chemotherapy have the longest survivals. Our group recently completed a safety and feasible trial in which we
administered ICI then performed surgical removal of the MPM tumor. The patients did particularly well; therefore,
we are currently opening a larger trial in which we administer either ICI or chemotherapy and ICI then perform
surgery. However, despite the addition of ICIs to treatment options, treatment responses only occur in a subset
of patients and long-term outcomes of patients with MPM remain poor regardless of the treatment strategy. Thus,
finding novel effective strategies to increase the therapeutic response to ICI is a critically unmet need.
A well-known problem with treating cancer is that the cancer cells develop resistance to death when treated with
any drug. A part of the cell that is responsible resisting treatment is the mitochondria which acts like the engine
by providing all the energy for tumor to grow while protecting it from cell death. In our prior work, we found that
a specific protein, Myeloid Cell Leukemia (Mcl-1), attaches to the mitochondria to protect it from death. When
we used a drug that blocked Mcl-1 with chemotherapy, the mitochondria no longer prevented tumor cell death
and the tumor died. Mcl-1 is extremely unstable resulting in rapid expression and destruction which makes it
hard to treat. Therefore, targeting proteins that regulate Mcl-1 may be a clinically effective strategy. In our prior
ICI trial, we found that a specific pathway within the mitochondria called the methionine metabolic pathway was
increased. A protein in that pathway, Protein Arginine Methyltransferase (PRMT) 5, determines whether Mcl-1
will block cell death. In this proposal, we will study whether targeting PRMT5 or Mcl-1 with drugs will restore the
tumor cell’s sensitivity to drug treatment. The long-term goal of this proposal is to attack the mitochondria to
overcome therapeutic resistance so patients can beat this disease. This study is highly translational in that we
will rapidly perform clinical trials based on these results. The goal of this study is to accelerate the development
of more effective therapies to improve the survival of patients with MPM."

The goal of the University of Florida (UF) Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Pilot and Exploratory
Studies Core (PESC) is to help plan future independently supported studies that address the UF OAIC’s
overall research theme of promotion of mobility and independence in older Americans. To this end, the
PESC solicits and selects promising innovative pilot, exploratory, and developmental studies and secure
optimal infrastructure, environment, funding, expertise, and resources. Core leaders monitor study progress,
help analyze and interpret results, and provide guidance in translating these pilot data into high-quality and
original research study applications that successfully compete for independent extramural funding. The
provision of funds for pilot, exploratory, and developmental studies supports Early Stage Investigators in their
efforts to develop research careers in aging.
The PESC also allows accomplished investigators in aging to gather data that extend and broaden their focus.
In this capacity, it encourages and facilitates experienced investigators traditionally working in other research
fields, such as physiology, pathology, metabolomics, cancer, pain, and the behavioral sciences, to expand their
research to include aging. This widens the pool of talent that we believe will contribute to advances in the
promotion of mobility and independence and the OAIC as a whole.
In this application we propose five pilot studies that offer a wide variety of interdisciplinary approaches to
address the OAIC research theme. As we have proven over the past several years, we are highly successful in
translating findings from our pilot, exploratory, and development studies into extramurally funded grants (up to
94% success rates), and also in supporting our Early Stage Investigators through career advances including
the tenure and promotion process."

TRD 1
The overarching theme of TRD 1 is to develop powerful new tools for functional imaging: specifically, the devel-
opment of advanced post-processing methods to 1) enhance endogenous contrast in polarization-sensitive
OCT tissue polarimetry, and 2) transform OCT angiography from a pseudo- to a fully-3D technique by dramati-
cally improving its cross-sectional quality and depth resolution. Current post-processing in OCT polarimetry
(PS-OCT) and angiography (OCTA) imparts significant resolution loss—roughly one order of magnitude—gen-
erating contrast with poor spatial resolution compared to the originating OCT data. There is a need for process-
ing techniques capable of preserving spatial resolution to enable a broad range of applications that are
presently outside the reach of OCT technology. This project will develop a probabilistic processing framework
based on the physics of light scattering and OCT image formation that leverages from the similarity of func-
tional signals typically present in biological sample tomograms. This framework will allow for estimation of the
underlying structure and associated contrast—or function—without compromising spatial resolution.
Aim 1 addresses the need for high-resolution cross-sectional polarimetric imaging of the living retina. Proba-
bilistic PS-OCT offers a new pathway to preserve the originating hardware’s resolution, alleviating the need for
increased optical resolution, limited by pupil size in human and animals and accompanied by an impractical re-
duction in the depth of field. This novel capability, combined with PS-OCT hardware equipped with adaptive op-
tics, will enable the determination of polarimetric parameters of individual axonal bundles in the retina. It will
permit PS-OCT to sensitively track retinal axonal degeneration in vivo, thus accelerating the development of
neuroprotective agents for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that rely on rodent models of this disease.
Aim 2 addresses the need to improve the spatial resolution and quality of OCTA in both preclinical and clinical
applications by further extending the probabilistic framework to the OCT signal dynamics. OCTA is also show-
ing significant promise in ophthalmology for the potential use in the early diagnosis and monitoring of diseases
including glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy; preclinical use include imaging animal models to improve under-
standing of tumor biology. However, its poor cross-sectional quality and resolution restricts OCTA to a pseudo-
3D imaging technique, with a depth resolution most commonly four to eight times poorer than in the originating
OCT tomogram, thus limiting angiographic analysis to en face and layer projections in virtually all applications.
Probabilistic OCTA will improve the lacking depth resolution of conventional OCTA, overcoming the insensitivity
to small capillaries and the distortion of true vessel dimensions, which currently undermine caliber and vascu-
lar-network quantitative metrics of great clinical interest in ophthalmology. OCTA with high cross-sectional qual-
ity would amplify its utility in the understanding of the three-dimensional tumor microenvironment, and unlock
the power of volumetric vascular-network metrics in preclinical and clinical applications."

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a gradual loss of kidney function, which affects an
estimated 37 million American adults, resulting in 14.6 deaths per 100,000 population. Once
kidney damage occurs, it impairs removal of uremic toxins, leading to further deterioration of
physiological functions and progression of renal failure. Surprisingly, many uremic toxins are not
produced by the body itself, but rather derived from the gut microbiota. CKD is associated with
changes in the composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis), which is characterized by an
increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the fecal microbiota, a group of microbes known
to produce uremic toxins, such as indole. The objectives of this application are to understand the
ecological causes of dysbiosis in CKD on a molecular level and to determine whether dysbiosis
has a causative effect on CKD progression. Our central hypothesis is that elevated expression of
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the intestine fuels growth of Enterobacteriaceae by
anaerobic nitrate respiration. In turn, increased indole production by respiring Enterobacteriaceae
aggravates CKD disease progression. We will test different aspects of our hypothesis using the
logical and innovative approach outlined in the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine
the ecological causes of dysbiosis during CKD. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether dysbiosis has
a causative effect on CKD progression. The proposed work is innovative because it is among the
first to provide molecular insights into how changes in the microbiota composition occur in CKD,
and how microbiota changes are causatively linked to disease progression. Successful
completion of the proposed work will establish how CKD-associated host responses drive
changes in the ecology of the gut microbiota, which in turn set the stage for release of uremic
toxins by Enterobacteriaceae, thus accelerating CKD progression. This outcome will be of broad
significance for the rational design of new intervention strategies."

 Auditory deprivation during childhood has serious consequences on all aspects of development.
Otitis media (OM) is a highly prevalent condition in young children. It is principally important to examine
the relationship between OM, hearing loss, and listening development to understand the functional
sequelae of OM. Currently, it is difficult to ascertain the link between early childhood OM and
developmental alterations in perception and listening because the available evidence is limited and is
based on cross-sectional studies. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the residual
effects of early childhood OM on functional listening development. In Aim 1, we will examine the effects
of OM on the development of spatial listening skills after the OM is resolved. We will also examine the
effect of resolved OM on the development of energetic and informational masking. In Aim 2, we will
measure the sensitivity to frequency modulation and temporal gap detection to track the residual
developmental effects of OM on basic auditory perceptual skills. In Aim 3, we will profile listening and
communication abilities, and model listening development to define its trajectory following resolved OM
in relationship to several predictors (e.g., OM history, hearing, cognition, etc.) using machine learning.
In our approach, we will follow young children individually, with responses recorded longitudinally on
experimental measures, and routinely document the middle ear status. The proposed work combines
laboratory-based and real-world measures and carefully considers auditory, cognitive,
language/literacy, and other factors for measuring functional listening skills comprehensively. Since
listening is critical for language and learning in the classroom, the outcomes of this proposal
are essential to understand the residual effects of OM on childhood development. This will improve our
scientific and clinical knowledge about the developmental effects of OM, influencing the fields of
audiology, pediatrics, speech-language pathology, otolaryngology, neuroscience, and early
intervention."
10829533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This advanced-level short course will provide intensive training in innovative approaches for designing and
conducting randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of behavioral interventions. Currently there is insufficient evidence
from behavioral RCTs to inform public health campaigns, clinical guidelines, and insurance coverage for
behavioral interventions. A stronger evidence base will emerge from more rigorous and definitive efficacy and
effectiveness trials. In the field of behavioral medicine, the intervention development process is not
standardized or accepted as it is for pharmacotherapy and devices. Investigators require didactic training not
often included in medical and graduate programs, as well as mentorship, to implement best practices for RCT
design and conduct. Greater reliance on interdisciplinary team science and translational research models, and
wider adoption of advanced methodologies, will increase the impact of behavioral intervention research. This
course is designed for early- to mid-career scientists who are already planning or conducting a behavioral RCT
or who are conducting early-stage intervention development research that is expected to lead to an RCT. It is
designed to provide a longitudinal learning experience during which learners (hereafter “fellows”) acquire
foundational knowledge and apply it to a planned RCT. This hybrid course includes a four-day, in-person
meeting at which foundational concepts will be discussed, and five learning communities comprising two
faculty members and six fellows will be formed. Each learning community will engage in nine monthly, two-hour
video conference calls. Prior to each call, fellows will watch videos or listen to podcasts about selected RCT
topics. The program will employ a facilitated peer mentoring model in which two experienced faculty members
will work with six fellows, who in turn serve as peer mentors. During the virtual meetings, they will discuss how
to apply the didactic content to their planned RCTs. The core faculty members are leading experts in various
behavioral intervention research methodologies and have real-world experience conducting behavioral RCTs.
Adjunct faculty members and guest speakers will include rising stars who are developing cutting-edge RCT
methodologies and staff from funding agencies and payers. Course content will be organized by the NIH Stage
Model for Behavioral Interventions and focus on Stages II (efficacy) through V (dissemination and
implementation) to complement existing R25 offerings. In short, this course will train the next generation of
scientists to design and conduct programmatic, strategically-focused, interdisciplinary behavioral RCTs. In so
doing, we will contribute the rigorous evidence needed to change clinical guidelines, practices, and policies."
10830972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal aims to enhance diversity within the biomedical workforce by supporting the development of
seven recent baccalaureate graduates from underrepresented backgrounds to be competitive for PhD
programs in the best biomedical research-oriented universities in the country. The “Northwestern University
Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (NU PREP)” represents an interdisciplinary initiative with
leadership and participating faculty distributed across 14 departments and representing the four biomedical
sciences graduate programs at NU. Given the breadth of both participating departments and applicants, PREP
will create individualized plans for skill building tailored to each scholar's training objectives, thus providing the
best preparation for success in graduate school. Experienced PREP mentors, in collaboration with PREP
leadership will work with trainees to customize a one-year research program focused on developing critical
thinking skills, research techniques, data analysis, and scientific communication. Preparation for graduate
school admissions will include instruction on writing personal statements and interviewing skills, student and
faculty perspectives panels on aspects of the application and interview process, and an optional GRE
workshop. Coursework will include one advanced undergraduate course to complement the trainee's previous
coursework, mini-courses in cellular physiology and molecular genetics, and scientific communication
workshops. Intensive advising using Individual Development Plans will be done to ensure that skill building,
research training and graduate school applications are progressing. PREP scholars will integrate into the local
Northwestern Community through engagement with graduate students, postdocs, and faculty at seminars,
retreats, and training events in one of ten institutional NIH-funded training programs and informal activities with
graduate student mentors (NU Guides). Cohort building activities include participation in joint events and
socials with the NU Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program; two joint socials with University of Chicago (UofC)
and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) PREP trainees; and a joint scientific conference with PREP trainees
from the UofC, UIC, Mayo Clinic and University of Michigan. Broader community building and scientific
networking will be achieved through attending Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students
(ABRCMS) or the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science
(SACNAS). PREP will be administered by the Director, three co-Investigators, a Program Coordinator, and an
Advisory Committee. Program evaluation and fine tuning will be done annually through services provided by
Northwestern's Searle Center for Teaching and Learning and Office for Research. The milestones of NU PREP
are for at least 80% of trainees to be admitted to a top ranked biomedical sciences graduate program and for
at least 80% of trainees to attain their PhD degrees within 6 years of graduate school matriculation. The one-
year NU PREP program has been designed to achieve these milestones."
10830974,"Candidate: Gustavo Ares, Ph.D., is a Research-Scientist Instructor training in the integrative renal physiology
related to hypertension at Henry Ford Health system. In this revised application, Dr. Ares aims to determine
whether a high salt diet stimulates the E3 ubiquitin-ligase FBXL13-NKCC2 interaction, enhancing NKCC2
degradation, favoring NaCl excretion thereby preventing an increase in blood pressure. Dr. Ares' immediate goal
is to acquire the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an independent extramurally
funded investigator. His long-term goal is to establish his own research program with a focus on identifying novel
targets of loops diuretics and pharmacological interventions to treat hypertension. Dr. Ares' Career
Development Plan consists of improving his: 1) research skills; 2) Networking and collaborations; 3)
professional development through attendance of presentations at weekly journal clubs, seminars, course and
national scientific meetings; 4) mentoring skills; 5) writing manuscripts and grants. Dr. Ares' progress will be
assessed thru bi-weekly to monthly meetings with each member of the mentoring team. Environment: Dr. Ares
and his mentor, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors to guide him through the research
project. Primary mentor: Dr. Pablo Ortiz a NIH-funded scientist with strong records of successful in renal
physiology and hypertension. Secondary mentor: Dr. Jeffery L. Garvin is a professor of physiology at CWRU
Cleveland, with extensive experience in regulation of salt and water transport along the renal nephron.
Secondary mentor: Dr. Peter Kaiser, professor and Chair of Biological Chemistry at UC Irvine, has extensive
experience in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and the E3-ubiquitin ligases with special interest in the Skp1-
Cullin-FBox family complex. The supportive research team includes T. Pavlov, Ph.D. and Mariela Mendez, Ph.D.
working in renal physiology; Pamela Harding Ph.D., N-E. Rhaleb, Ph.D., Suresh Palaniyandi, Ph.D. working in
cardiovascular physiology/pathophysiology. Research: Hypertension is a highly prevalent condition involving
the kidney's inability to excrete excess salt. Abnormally enhanced NaCl reabsorption thru the apical Na+/K+/2Cl-
cotransporter (NKCC2) by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) is associated with salt-sensitive
hypertension in humans. NKCC2 inhibitors has many side effects, therefore they are not used. This project study
the role of a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL13 on NaCl reabsorption and blood pressure regulation under normal
or high salt diet. In Aim I, we study the effect of high salt on NKCC2 ubiquitination, surface phosphor (Thr96-101
and Ser126) and total NKCC2 expression and activity. In Aim II, we will study the FBXL13-NKCC2 interaction. In
Aim III We study the role of FBXL13 on NaCl reabsorption and blood pressure regulation. This application will
advance our knowledge which may lead to new strategies for the treatment of hypertension and promote the
development of novel and specific loop diuretics."
