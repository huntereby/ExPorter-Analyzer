We are interested in the dynamic interplay between the intracellular distribution of mitochondria and cellular
function. Mitochondria are important not only for cellular energy production but also play critical roles in cell cycle
progression, differentiation, immune responses, lipid and calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic cell death. These
diverse roles are intimately connected to mitochondrial shape and cellular position. Thus, it is not surprising
aberrant mitochondrial architecture has been implicated in an ever-increasing number of diseases. It is well
appreciated that mitochondrial division, fusion, and motility all contribute to the overall distribution of mitochondria
within a cell. However, the critical contributions of actively tethering the organelle to specific cellular sites and
structures, including other organelles, are becoming increasingly evident. While tethering plays a critical role in
mitochondrial positioning, interorganelle contact, and, consequently, cellular function in cells from yeast to
neurons, the molecular mechanisms and regulation are poorly understood. In the aims of this grant, we will
address this deficit by using a mitochondria-ER-cortex tether in yeast as a model to understand the mechanism
and regulation of mitochondrial tethers and the multifunctional mitochondrial membrane contact sites they create.
The proposed work will address the exciting and unexpected impacts mitochondrial tethers have on cellular
organization and function. The goals are to uncover fundamental mechanisms used by mitochondrial tethers to
position mitochondria and form interorganelle contacts and elucidate the functional and physiological
consequences of these activities. In doing so, this work will provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies for
a range of human disease conditions in which the manipulation of the position and the contacts made by
mitochondria can be used to positively influence cellular health and homeostasis."
10776545,"There is a fundamental knowledge gap in achieving maternal glycemic control sufficient to reduce maternal
and neonatal morbidity and mortality in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nearly all
pregnant individuals with T2DM experience either maternal or newborn morbidity, with disparities seen in
socially disadvantaged groups. The key to reducing these adverse outcomes, especially for the newborn, is
achieving maternal glycemic control; and the first step towards this goal is effective glucose monitoring.
Current self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) 4 times daily is burdensome and only provides snapshots of
glycemic status. Compared to SMBG, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was shown to improve maternal
glycemic control and reduce the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) pregnancies, but
the benefits in T2DM pregnancies are unknown. An additional challenge is that what constitutes adequate
glycemic control in T2DM pregnancies is also unknown. While there are established glucose targets for SMBG
and CGM, the percentage of glucose values that should meet these targets is not clear. Last, social
determinants of health must also be addressed as they create barriers to T2DM management and contribute to
up to 60% of disparities in outcomes. The overarching goal is to improve short- and long-term maternal and
child outcomes and achieve health equity among pregnant individuals with T2DM. The research objective of
this proposal is to determine the effectiveness of real-time CGM at reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity,
define an outcome-based definition for glycemic control and identify social and structural barriers to improving
outcomes. The central hypothesis is that real-time CGM provides patients and providers the necessary tool
to prevent maternal hyperglycemia and improve neonatal outcomes in T2DM pregnancies. Additionally, we
hypothesize that unfavorable social determinants of health interfere with T2DM management and result in
disparate outcomes. These hypotheses will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Determine
the effectiveness of real-time CGM at reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality in pregnant individuals with
T2DM, compared to SMBG, 2) Determine the effectiveness of real-time CGM at improving maternal glycemic
control and reducing maternal morbidity, compared to SMBG, and 3) Identify the biologic, personal, social and
ecological factors associated with morbidity and mortality of neonates born to pregnant individuals with T2DM.
Successful completion of the proposed study will determine if real-time CGM, compared to SMBG, improves
maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant individuals with T2DM and define what SMBG and CGM goals
constitute adequate glycemic control. Identification of the social determinants of health associated with
disparities in this historically disadvantaged population will lay the foundation for future intervention studies to
improve health equity. This project has the potential to revolutionize management of T2DM in pregnancy and
impact the lives of 100,000 pregnant individuals and their children in the U.S. each year."
10845565,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans can range from very mild or no symptoms to severe
respiratory failure. Although hyperactivation of various cellular components of the immune system have been
observed in patients with severe COVID-19 illness, the host genetic factors that determine susceptibility to
severe COVID-19 illness are not well understood. GWAS studies have reported several genetic loci that are
significantly associated with severe COVID-19 and defined several target genes based on their proximity to the
risk loci, although this approach does not accurately prioritize causal genes. We conducted one of the first
transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) in primary immune cells to define genes that are associated with
COVID-19 severity. In this R21 proposal, we will focus on defining functional COVID-19 risk variants linked to
top two candidate genes (OAS1 and IL10RB) from our genetic analyses.
In Aim 1, we will determine the functional COVID-19 risk eQTLs associated with OAS1 expression in non-
classical monocytes (NCM). Our TWAS study showed significant association of COVID-19 severity with reduced
expression of interferon-inducible gene (OAS1) specifically in NCM. OAS1 encodes for oligoadenylate synthase
family of proteins that degrade viral RNA and activate anti-viral responses, thus variants altering its expression
levels, especially in NCM, a cell type which has been implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis, are likely to have
an important role in host immune responses. Here, we will undertake experimental studies to define the functional
variant(s) in the dense OAS1 Neanderthal haploblock harboring >100 SNPs. Briefly, we will perform (i) CRISPRi
assays to determine functional enhancers that overlap COVID-19 risk SNPs, (ii) luciferase reporter assays to
determine the function variants in such enhancers, (iii) ChIP to determine allele-specific binding of the
transcription factor RXRα the binding of which is predicted to be disrupted by COVID-19-risk variants, and (iv)
HDR-mediated editing of prioritized COVID-19-risk eQTLs to definitively establish functionality.
In Aim 2, we will determine the function COVID-19 risk eQTLs associated with IL10RB expression in NK cells
and T cells. Our TWAS showed that increased expression of IL10RB in NK cells was significantly associated
with COVID-19 severity. IL10RB encodes for IL-10 receptor beta, and given the immunomodulatory role of IL-
10, it is likely that the higher expression on the IL10RB in NK cells and T cells may enhance their responsiveness
to IL-10. Here, we will perform experimental studies as described in Aim 1 to define the functional COVID-19-
risk variants that are predicted to perturb the binding of the transcription factors TCF12 and GATA-3 and their
role in the modulation of IL10RB expression in NK cells in T cells.
Overall, functional studies in this R21 program will provide important mechanistic insights into the genetic basis
of COVID-19 severity."

Skill for ENtrepreneurs for Elder Solutions (SENES) fellowship program
 Project Summary/Abstract
The University City Science Center (UCSC) will launch a 12-month immersive fellowship, “Skill
for ENtrepreneurs for Elder Solutions fellowship program (SENES).” SENES is Latin for
“elderly,” and the program will provide specific and meaningful support for PhD, Medical Doctor
(MD), or graduate-level students or recent graduates from an entrepreneurial education
perspective. SENES raises participants’ awareness and potential application areas of solutions
the founders may be developing related to the cognitive and functional impact of aging and/or
Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
SENES is a year-long educational experience that will provide a five-founder cohort (annually;
25 over five years) with six months of hands-on learning punctuated with an “elder solutions”
capstone project in month six. The second six months of the fellowship will be an active and
supported technology translation in one of tracks, all supported by medical faculty and aging-
focused advisors as well as the experienced commercialization team at UCSC.
Track 1: Entrepreneurial – Fellows build off their capstone project to begin hitting milestones in
developing their venture, raising venture capital, applying for SBIR.
Track 2: Non-Entrepreneurial – Fellows explore a non-venture research project related to
translation of research and development (R&D) or academic applications of lessons learned.
SENES has a focus on providing exposure and opportunity to convert the theoretical
understanding of entrepreneurial concepts (explicit knowledge) into applied and understood
entrepreneurship focused activities (tacit knowledge). We will expose founders to the aging
market for their solutions in a practical and material way. It is hypothesized that students
participating in the program will be better positioned for success in their commercialization
efforts, resulting in more successful technology-based startups from NIH-funded and supported
researchers. SENES will also leverage government investment by increasing the likelihood of
success of private capital conduct evaluation of fellows over a five-year period to measure
career trajectory and increases in entrepreneurial literacy and entrepreneurial success.
The overall opportunity for the SENES fellowship is to redefine the thinking about traditional
innovation and entrepreneurial training to create better outcomes for academic-based founders.
If successful, this model could become another tool in federal innovation and support
programming for scientific founders in the future."

The goal of this application is to address critical gaps in our understanding of the central DNA repair pathway in
humans by using new single molecule methods. In replicating mammalian cells chromosomal breaks are
repaired via two main pathways: the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is active throughout
the cell cycle, and homologous recombination (HR) that is mainly active during replication. Mutations in HR
proteins are associated with genome instability and predisposition to cancer, whereas mutations in NHEJ
proteins result in genome instability, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and IR sensitivity, the latter
relevant to patient hypersensitivity to therapeutic IR. Consequently, NHEJ and HR factors are recognized as
promising targets for inhibition to improve the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy. Additionally, the interplay
between these pathways has implication for the development of resistance to therapy in the treatment of cancer.
 Although the mechanisms that control NHEJ and HR also have key roles in normal human development, our
current state of knowledge regarding the organization and crosstalk between these pathways and their
correlations with the DNA damage response (DDR) is minimal. We especially know very little about the physical
nature of the repair complexes and how they are assembled/disassembled and regulated at DNA break sites;
this is because common biochemical, structural and cell biology approaches are limited in their capacities to
provide this information.
 In this study we will use an array of innovative single-molecule techniques and assays to address this
knowledge gap and to define the molecular mechanisms of DSB repair via NHEJ and at single-ended breaks in
replicating cells. We use single-molecule biochemical methods to determine the role of NHEJ filament proteins,
and reexamine basic mechanisms that link DDR and NHEJ repair. We will use single-molecule localization
microscopy and live cell imaging to map the organization of HR/NHEJ repair intermediates in-vivo and determine
their positional dependence, and study their regulation and the role of DDR factors in pathway choice. We will
define the nanoscale architecture of DSB complexes in cells and determine their association with cellular DNA
damage response (DDR) factors and characterize how these are modulated in different types of DSBs.
Combined, the proposed study will address critical unanswered questions with have enormous potential for
advancing the field of DNA damage research."
10756497,"The heme protein NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) is a transmembrane signaling enzyme which produces
superoxide in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels and is emerging as an exciting player in
immunity and the cardiovascular system. NOX5 is crucial for proper vascular contraction and appears to be
a nexus between cellular redox and calcium signaling, As the most recently discovered member of the
NOX family of enzymes, details of NOX5 regulation and its role in the cell remain poorly resolved. It has,
however, been implicated in numerous human diseases including cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular
disorders. Elucidating details of NOX5 regulation and its role in cardiovascular health and disease is crucial
to our understanding of normal cellular functions and how these become disrupted in disease. Based on
preliminary data from the K99 phase, the R00 phase will focus on investigating the role of NOX5 in
cardiomyocyte function and its contribution to the initiation and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) (Aim 1)
and to probe the significance of novel protein:protein interactions identified in the K99 phase which link
NOX5 and the actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, RNA regulation and stress response systems (Aim 2). Aim
1 will focus on understanding how NOX5 knockdown and overexpression affect gene and protein
expression, calcium flux, and cellular metabolism in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived
cardiomyocytes, and then using patient tissue from hearts in AF or sinus rhythm to test hypothesizes
generated from the iPSC derived cardiomyocyte system. Aim 2 will use a model cell system (HEK293 cells
and HEK293 cells overexpressing NOX5) as well as iPSC derived cardiomyocytes to probe the interactome
of NOX5 in response to stimuli and to understand how these interactions affect NOX5 activity and
localization, the actin cytoskeleton, calcium flux, cellular metabolism, gene expression and the stress
response system. This project will uncover crucial details about the role of NOX5 in the heart and in the
broader context of cellular homeostasis. It will also lay important groundwork for identifying molecular
factors responsible for the switch between physiological and pathological responses and identify
interactions and interaction networks ideal for further study using purified components for use in
reconstitution assays, structural biology projects, mechanistic studies using biochemical approaches and
drug discovery projects."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of ill health on a global scale and are responsible
for seven out of ten deaths. Epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in the developmental origins of NCDs
and can transfer information about maternal nutrition to offspring. Genomic imprinting is a mechanism of
epigenetic regulation that leads to monoallelic expression of genes based on parent of origin, without regard to
DNA sequence. Currently, a major obstacle in the genomic imprinting field is the total lack of longitudinal data
on human phenotypes. Such data are needed for understanding why there is so much variability in imprinting
between individuals and the functional significance of this variability. This study will test the innovative
hypothesis that natural variation in imprinting transmits maternal growth and life history phenotypes to
offspring. The researchers collected longitudinal phenotypic data on two generations of mothers and offspring
in Mali, West Africa (1998 to 2020). The maternal phenotypes of interest are relevant to NCDs and include
body mass index, height, stunting, height-for-age z-score (HAZ) trajectories in childhood, age at puberty and
menarche, as well as pre-pregnancy BMI and fat stores (buttocks circumference). The offspring phenotypes
include birth parameters, growth trajectories for BMI, height, and HAZ to age 5 years, age at weaning, and age
at attainment of developmental milestones for locomotion (sitting without support, standing alone, and walking
alone). When the offspring were born, the researchers collected 470 placentas, of which 385 passed quality
controls. This study has three specific aims. Aim 1: Test the effects of longitudinally measured maternal
nutrition, growth, and life history phenotypes on imprinting in 259 genes in placentas delivered at term. This
aim will require the generation of a high-resolution dataset on allele specific expression (ASE) in 385 placentas
using a high throughput sequencing technique called “targeted RNAseq.” The targeting region includes the
exons of all genes that are known to be imprinted in humans or that are closely associated with differentially
methylated regions (DMRs). Aim 2: Test the effects of longitudinally measured maternal nutrition, growth, and
life history phenotypes on methylation and hydroxymethylation of both ubiquitous and placenta specific DMRs.
Using targeted DNA-methyl sequencing, the researchers will determine the variability in methylation on 1,695
DMRs in 385 placentas. Aim 3: Test the effects of epigenetic read-outs (ASE and DNA methylation) on
offspring phenotypes. The results of this study will be significant for understanding why there is so much inter-
individual variation in imprinting and DNA methylation. This variability, which presently is of unknown
significance, has the potential to be at the crux of diseases that are rooted in deficits and surfeits of maternal
nutrition. In sum, this study will provide new insight into the developmental origins of health and disease."
10756467,"Melanoma Brain Metastasis (MBM) carries a dismal prognosis with a median overall survival of only 4-6 months.
If patients develop leptomeningeal disease, the overall survival is even lower. The incidence of MBM has been
reported to be up to 43% in clinical settings and up to 75% in the autopsy series. Although notions that Circulating
Tumor Cells (CTCs) act as “seeds” of intractable metastasis are established, there is no knowledge characterizing
MBM-colonizing CTCs. Single-cell CTC transcriptional profiling has also demonstrated that CTCs isolated from
patients are very distinct from cell lines that are widely used for drug discovery. This is even more compelling
considering that significant discrepancies of biomarkers among CTCs and corresponding primary and metastatic
tumors have been observed. Moreover, while the presence of CTCs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the
gold standard, the sensitivity of cytology is only 50-56% at time of the first CSF analysis. Therefore, the
development of effective therapy approaches - CTC-based tests - could have a tremendous clinical impact to treat
MBM. We hypothesize that the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR and Heparanase (HPSE), two markers implicated
in MBM models, are novel CTC biomarkers to predict clinical MBM and potential therapeutic targets to prevent
MBM. The objective of this application is to demonstrate that the p75NTR/HPSE axis is diagnostic in clinical
MBM; and that p75NTR and HPSE are novel therapeutic CTC targets to combat MBM. In aim 1, we will: a) isolate
and characterize p75NTR/HPSE CTC subsets from blood and CSF (multiparametric flow cytometry and
DEPArrayTM technologies among others), and compare the expression of p75NTR/HPSE combinations in CTCs
of melanoma patients diagnosed either with or without MBM; b) directly link patient-isolated CTC subsets,
possessing p75NTR/HPSE expression and combinations, to clinical MBM. In aim 2, we will assess effects of
regulating functions of p75NTR/HPSE CTC subsets on MBM development by using small-molecule p75NTR and
new HPSE inhibitors along with CTC xenografts; and complement these effects with regulatory p75NTR/HPSE
gene expression (pINDUCER lentiviral toolkit). In aim 3, we will: a) determine roles of CTC-expressed Merlin as
an important integrator of p75NTR/HPSE pathways altering CTC proliferation vs. growth arrest; b) delineate
HPSE-induced, syndecan-mediated modulation of Merlin/Hippo signaling to affect CTC properties driving MBM.
Uncovering MBM CTC phenotypes offers the opportunity to modify treatment by extending studies directly to
human melanoma. This project lead by an inter-disciplinary and well-integrated team will study and validate new
and specific CTC biomarkers responsible for CTC-induced MBM. It has high therapeutic impact and is paradigm-
shifting. We are uniquely positioned to perform this study not only for having access to an extensive cohort of
blood/CSF samples from melanoma patients but also for the extensive expertise interrogating the entire CTC
spectrum by combining multiple and complementary CTC technologies unlike other groups in the country."
10777035,"Top-down regulation of cortical processing is critical for learning, attention, figure-ground separation,
multisensory integration, contextual-modulation and many other processes associated with cognition. However,
the biological mechanisms supporting top-down computation remain elusive. A popular and compelling
hypothesis is that top-down computation is implemented via the engagement of apical tuft dendrites in layer 1.
This hypothesis is indirectly supported by convergent anatomical and functional evidence, including observations
in patients with disorders associated with disrupted top-down processing, but more direct evidence linking
dendritic integration to top-down mechanisms is limited. To address this gap, we developed a novel imaging
approach that allows simultaneous recording of somas and dendrites in large populations of neurons during
learning, without signal contamination. We will combine this approach with two complementary behavioral tasks:
a highly controlled Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm and a comparatively naturalistic virtual navigation
task. Through the set of proposed experiments, we aim to test the overarching hypothesis that top-down
computation is implemented via the engagement of apical tuft dendrites in layer 1, and that these signals are
responsible for guiding learning in networks of neurons. We will do this by: (1) Establishing the relationship
between single-neuron dendritic integration and circuit dynamics and studying the principles governing the
changes in this relationship over the course of learning; (2) Interrogating the relationship between dendritic
activity and behavioral variables, how this relationship is modified over the course of learning, and how dendrites
instruct changes in their corresponding somas; and (3) Testing the hypothesis that dendrites receive vectorized
error signals consistent with an efficient solution to the credit assignment problem. Results from these
experiments will catalyze a new ways of thinking about cortical computation and learning principles in biological
systems, propelling the field into new directions with impactful scientific and translational potential."
10782974,"The estimated heritability of kidney disease is around 50%. Common variants, that are almost always
non-coding, account for much of the predisposition to prevalent, later-onset kidney diseases such as diabetic
and hypertensive kidney disease (DKD, HKD). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided a
comprehensive inventory of these variants, each variant with modest impact on disease risk, but in aggregate
they can explain most of disease heritability. Despite the remarkable success of GWAS, it has not translated
into improved disease diagnostics and therapeutics as we fail to understand how non-coding variants
cause kidney disease.
 The generally agreed model is that disease causing variants are on gene regulatory (open
chromatin) region, alter transcription factor binding strength and quantitatively change the expression
of a target gene in a cell type specific manner. Causal variant identification is impeded as DNA sequences
that are close to each other are inherited together making it difficult to pick from the many linked variants. Due
to secondary chromatin structure the nearest coding gene is not always the causal gene. The genotype effect
may be cell-type specific explaining organ specific disease development.
 During the last award cycle, we catalogued genotype-driven gene-expression variation (eQTL;
expression quantitative trait loci) in the glomerular and tubule compartments of human kidneys. Integration of
the kidney GWAS and eQTL catalogues has been successful in identifying putative disease-causing genes
and in a follow-up mouse gene knock-out study we showed that Dab2 is such new disease-causing gene.
Kidney single cell gene expression analysis pointed to enrichment of disease associated genes in proximal
tubules."
10779862,"Project Summary
For children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), resective surgery is the most effective treatment to achieve
seizure-freedom. Its success depends on the resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). The gold standard to
estimate the EZ is by recording seizures with intracranial EEG (iEEG) and localize their onset, namely the seizure
onset zone (SOZ). Yet, the SOZ does not always predict outcome, and its delineation often requires several
days of recordings to capture seizures. Moreover, iEEG presents limitations due to its invasiveness and often
leads to erroneous results. Noninvasive electrophysiological techniques, which can record interictal spikes from
the whole brain, could overcome the iEEG limitations. However, spikes suffer from low specificity to the EZ
mostly because they propagate across large brain areas forming epileptic networks. These networks are often
larger than the EZ and thus may overlap with eloquent areas that should be preserved. Understanding of the
functional architecture of the epileptic networks may allow for selective disruption (or modulation) of key
components of these networks to halt seizures without removing the entire network. This approach could
potentially improve the post-operative seizure control and help prevent post-operative functional deficits. This
application aims to construct normative functional and effective connectivity brain maps from typically developing
children, assess whether functional and effective connectivity deviations from normative predict the EZ and
surgical outcome in children with DRE, and reveal the relationship between propagating interictal activity and
information flow among spikes onset and areas of spread. We hypothesize that: (1) hubs with deviated functional
and effective connectivity (i.e., high functional connectivity and outwards information flow) from normative identify
the EZ in children with DRE; (2) resection of pathological hubs disrupts the epileptogenic network predicting
outcome better than the SOZ; (3) information flows outwards from spike onset to areas of spread; and (4) hubs
with deviated (from normative) functional and effective connectivity values overlap with the onset of spike
propagation. To test our hypotheses, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) construct normative maps
from noninvasive data and compare with data from children with DRE; (2) assess whether functional and effective
connectivity deviations from normative maps predict the EZ and surgical outcome; and (3) reveal the relationship
between information flow and epileptiform propagating activity. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG
and MEG data from 70 children (4-18 years old) with MRE and 70 age- and gender-matched typically developing
children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments and innovative
signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a
direct impact on the life of children with DRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that
would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, prevent post-operative functional
deficits, and improve the surgical outcome, particularly children who were previously ineligible for neurosurgery."

Despite the use of aggressive chemo-radiation therapy, children with high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)

multimodality therapies are associated with life-long life-threatening sequelae. This project focuses on
developing less-genotoxic, targeted therapy for RAS-mutant ERMS. Preliminary data support rapid translation
of vertical targeting of the MAPK pathway as a therapeutic approach in ERMS. The proposed aims are based

RMS PDX/CDX models, thus directly impacting clinical trials design for RAS-driven ERMS."

10781973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and debilitating clinical problem that negatively impacts the health and
quality of life of millions of people. A common and relatively effective strategy to provide acute relief to chronic
pain patients is through prescription of opioid compounds. However, opioid analgesics carry substantial abuse
and overdose liabilities, contributing heavily to the ongoing opioid epidemic. These negative consequences of
exogenous opioids result from their diffuse action at endogenous mu opioid receptor-expressing (MOR) brain
regions beyond the pain-encoding neurocircuitry that they are intended to modulate. To meet the pressing
demand for effective and safe analgesics, new, targeted pain therapies must be developed that emerge from
focused research on the endogenous opioidergic cell types and neural circuits involved in pain perception (i.e.,
nociception) and opioid-induced analgesia. The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is critical in this regard
as it can produce robust antinociception through MOR and the enkephalin peptides expressed by the cells and
afferents it contains. Yet, long-standing questions remain concerning the endogenous opioid signaling dynamics
in the vlPAG that are recruited by acute and chronic pain conditions. This proposal will begin to fill these gaps in
knowledge with a combination of novel tools: genetic recombination in defined neural populations, MOR specific
promoter viruses, and a fluorescent enkephalin sensor. Combined, these approaches allow for unprecedented
in vivo access to the pre- and postsynaptic components of endogenous opioid transmission in the vlPAG. Thus,
I will test my central hypothesis that the vlPAG contains a functional nociceptive MOR-expressing ensemble
that is modulated by enkephalin release from forebrain and local interneurons to produce antinociception. In Aim
1, I will use classical pain assays to identify the molecular identity and calcium signaling activity patterns of the
nociceptive MOR-expressing neural ensemble in the vlPAG (vlPAGNoci/MOR). I will further determine the functional
role of vlPAGNoci/MOR neurons in antinociception through optogenetic inhibition during acute and inflammatory
pain states. In Aim 2, I will identify and manipulate two putative enkephalinergic inputs to the vlPAG, local vlPAG
interneurons and long-range medial nucleus of the central amygdala (CeM) projections, to determine their
respective contributions to nociception. How these enkephalingeric afferents interact with the MOR-expressing
neurons in the vlPAG will also be determined. The results of these proposed experiments will advance our
understanding of endogenous opioid signaling processes that are engaged and altered by acute and chronic
pain conditions. By elucidating the components of the endogenous opioid circuitry of the vlPAG that produce
analgesia, relief from chronic pain may be realized by future therapies that target this system while lacking the
harmful addictive properties of current opioid drugs. Completion of this Fellowship proposal will achieve my
training goals to expand my experimental expertise and establish myself as an expert in pain and opioidergic
neurocircuitry."
10781977,"Abstract
Ascribe Bioscience is developing a novel technology to prevent foodborne outbreaks caused by the
consumption of edible sprouts. Sprouts are highly vulnerable to infection with human enteric bacterial
pathogens at the seed stage. These pathogens then grow exponentially in the warm and humid conditions used
for sprouting. Even low initial bacterial counts on seeds can result in unsafe microbial loads by the end of sprout
production and processing. Moreover, the internalization of contaminating bacteria into seed tissues
contaminates the sprout tissues from inside, rendering the application of antimicrobials largely ineffective.
Sprouts have emerged as a significant source of foodborne illness and have become a public health hazard.
Between 1996 and 2017, the U.S. experienced 58 foodborne illness outbreaks associated with sprouts,
encompassing at least 1,953 illnesses, 212 hospitalizations, and 5 deaths. According to the FDA, no single
treatment so far has been shown to eliminate pathogens on seeds or sprouts that cause foodborne
illness. Ascribe Bioscience will use a natural, microbiome-derived molecule that activates and/or prime plant
defenses at the seed stage, thereby conferring to sprouts an enhanced resistance against contamination by
disease-causing bacterial pathogens. Ascribe's proposed treatment technology has the potential to
dramatically improve the safety of edible sprouts by addressing both external and internal bacterial
contamination. In Phase I, Ascribe has established the feasibility of the technology for the prevention of outbreaks
related to human consumption of sprouts by demonstrating that treatment with our molecule can prevent
Salmonella growth during the sprouting process in alfalfa. In Phase II, we will finalize the sprout seed treatment
formulation and expand testing to a broader spectrum of sprout-pathogen systems. To support
commercialization, we will perform toxicity and residue testing for regulatory approval, and refine synthesis
methodologies to enable large-scale production of the active ingredient. The specific aims of this Phase II project
are 1) Refine treatment formulation, including optimized formulation development, determination of the minimum
effective dose and treatment duration, comparison of the effectiveness of the formulation versus the sprout
industry-standard treatments, and measuring the effects of the formulation on germination, growth and sprout
quality; 2) Test the efficacy of treatments against other illness-causing pathogens on a variety of sprout types,
and evaluate it's role in altering bacterial abilities to form biofilm; 3) Demonstrate safety via toxicology studies
and residue testing to support EPA approval; 4) Develop methods to scale the synthesis of active ingredient to
pilot scale, and 5) Investigate the ability of the molecule to provide post-harvest protection to leafy greens. The
proposed research is expected to yield commercial products that will prevent or dramatically reduce the
incidence of sprout-related foodborne outbreaks."

The remarkable ability of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to give rise to a plethora of fully functional somatic cell
types becomes progressively impaired upon ex vivo culture by aberrant gain or loss of DNA methylation marks
at essential developmental gene loci. This pervasive epigenetic instability represents a significant hurdle for
biomedical applications using PSCs, but the underlying molecular reasons remain almost entirely unknown. An
important example for epigenetic instability in PSCs is loss of genomic imprinting, an essential gene regulatory
mechanism in mammals. By combining transgenic reporter alleles for imprint stability with mouse genetics, we
found that imprint dysregulation in PSCs is caused by identifiable genetic variants that affect trans acting
chromatin regulators. The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive molecular understanding on
how specific genetic variants affect the stability of vital epigenetic marks in PSCs. To work towards this goal,
we will first functionally dissect the causal variants within a genomic susceptibility region that we discovered
and which drives locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and loss of developmental potential. This will allow us to
pinpoint gene regulatory features that predispose imprinted and other genes to aberrant gain of DNA
methylation (Aim 1). We will then use genetic mapping in hybrid PSCs to discover quantitative trait loci that
can protect against detrimental DNA hypomethylation and validate the function of associated gene products in
both mouse and human pluripotent cells (Aim 2). Finally, we will model the genetics of imprint stability in a
panel of PSCs with highly diverse yet well-characterized genomes. This will enable us to dissect the molecular
regulation of epigenetic stability in complex genetic backgrounds resembling the human population and help us
to establish new biomarkers for the identification of culture conditions that preserve developmental potential in
PSCs of unknown genetic background (Aim 3). Our work will establish novel conceptual and mechanistic
frameworks for the detrimental epigenetic vulnerability of pluripotent cells, which will aid the safe and reliable
use of these cells to study developmental and disease processes. In addition, our findings will have relevance
for a wide range of human diseases and developmental syndromes characterized by epigenetic instability."

 These studies are focused on developing new catalytic approaches and strategies to improve the
availability of cardiotonic steroids, bioactive terpenoids, and glycosylated natural product-based molecules of
therapeutic value. Due to the importance of steroidal hormones for the regulation of vital biological processes in
the human body, many members of the terpene family of natural products possess a wide spectrum of biological
activities. In particular, cardiotonic steroids have many centuries-long history of serving as effective drugs for the
treatment of various heart conditions. In addition, many recent studies suggest that these compounds hold great
potential as the therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, immune and metabolic diseases,
and in various important health-related areas such as contraception. The developed in these studies new
synthetic approaches could significantly improve the availability of otherwise difficult-to-access stereoisomeric
cardenolide scaffolds with unusual substitution or oxidation patterns, and one of our objectives is to conduct the
medicinal chemistry exploration of various natural and unnatural cardiotonic steroids. The techniques developed
in this project will also improve the accessibility of related natural products such as bioactive plant- and bacteria-
derived glycosylated steroids, and diterpenes of grayanotoxin, isopimarane and kuarane families. Finally, these
studies will result in new catalytic techniques and strategies that will enable a direct and straightforward
glycosylation of complex natural products. One of the important objectives of these studies will be developing
new methods and catalysts for the asymmetric reactions that will enable the synthesis of natural products and
therapeutic agents."
10761738,"Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) predisposes to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, including
Alzheimer’s Disease. Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific disorder with acute hypertension and placental
SVD, is emerging as a sex-specific risk factor for dementia later in life. How PE is implicated in the etiology of
dementia is not known. Women with PE have SVD also in other vascular beds, including the brain, after
pregnancy and worsening with older age, suggesting this process evolves over time. However, studies on SVD
in midlife are sparse. Midlife is an ideal time to assess this risk as PE-differences in cognition are already
detectable, and yet there is time to mitigate progression to dementia. Cerebral SVD (cSVD) in midlife may hold
the key to understand how PE is implicated in cognitive impairment.
Placental SVD, known as maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) predicts worse short-term pregnancy
outcomes. We find MVM and PE combined predict long-term worse maternal vascular health in cardiac,
sublingual, and cerebral beds. In our pilot study (n=24) MVM and PE combined predicted lower
cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR, an early stage of cSVD), especially in fronto-parietal areas; in turn, lower CVR
in these regions was associated with, and appeared to explain, PE-related worse cognition.
Importantly, these
findings were independent of hypertension, suggesting PE has direct and lasting vascular effects
. PE and
MVM may be early indicators of a future cerebrovascular phenotype, manifesting in midlife as lower CVR, and
may explain how PE affects cognition. We propose to study midlife women with and without prior PE to: 1)
Characterize the neural basis of PE-related poorer cognitive performance, 2) Assess whether placental SVD
(MVM) predicts cSVD and cognition, and 3) Explore whether sublingual SVD and circulating markers of SVD
are markers of cSVD and cognition.
We propose a neurocognitive study to capture early stages of cSVD and cognitive status in a racially diverse
cohort of
450
women (1:1 PE and non PE) from our ongoing WINDOWS study, mean age=45, 15 years post-
pregnancy, 30% black, with existing data on PE, MVM, and sublingual SVD 10 years after pregnancy. We will
use our advanced multimodal neuroimaging protocols to quantify cSVD (including CVR, blood flow,
connectivity), standardized validated protocols to measure cognition, and non-invasive markers of SVD
(sublingual SVD, and
circulating biomarker profiles)
. Our project is uniquely positioned to identify a previously
occult high-risk group that can be identified at delivery by placental pathology, and who may benefit from risk-
stratification for dementia, to mitigate or delay disease progression."

Over 150 drugs are linked to significant hearing loss, leading to hearing impairment in over one million
people per year. For many drugs, ototoxicity is primarily based on individual case studies, so the true
ototoxic burden is largely unknown. Further, medication use is heavily skewed towards elderly patients
who often have pre-existing hearing loss. We are unlikely to detect a specific ototoxicity in these patients,
nor should we use patients as a testbed for harmful side-effects. We propose a rapid, low-cost solution to
detect ototoxicity during pre-clinical drug development. We developed an innovative machine learning
(ML) model that uses proprietary algorithms to compare chemical and molecular features of new drugs to
a curated database of known ototoxins and non-ototoxins to predict the relative ototoxic potential of
these drugs. Our strong pilot data show that this model categorizes ototoxins vs. non-ototoxins with 87%
accuracy, within the range of similar models that predict toxicity in other organs. The long-term goal is to
develop an online portal with a user-friendly interface for customers to incorporate our ototoxicity
prediction model into their early-stage drug development pipelines before they invest substantial time
and capital in a lead compound. The goal of this Phase 1 STTR proposal is to improve and
experimentally test our ML ototoxicity prediction technology. We will accomplish this goal with two
Specific Aims: 1) Optimize and apply our ototoxicity prediction model, and 2) Experimentally validate
model predictions in the zebrafish lateral line. For Aim 1 we will use semi-supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and transfer learning approaches to further optimize our model to achieve 90%
accuracy, then apply our model to a database of FDA-approved drugs. For Aim 2 we will determine the
accuracy of model output using the zebrafish system, which is an ideal platform for rapid in vivo
ototoxicity validation. We plan to build upon our zebrafish experience to build a Contract Research
Organization (CRO) as a value-add for customers who use our ML service. The FDA recognizes that the
lack of preclinical ototoxicity testing presents a danger to patients and that there is a need for cost-
effective, sensitive nonclinical ototoxicity assessment options, providing an exciting opportunity for our
technology. Further, the new NIDCD Strategic Plan calls for application of ML algorithms to prevent
auditory disorders. Our unique combination of experts in ototoxicity, preclinical drug development,
machine learning, and commercialization of AI-based technologies ideally positions us for success in this
Phase 1 project."
10927446,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
For the >330,000 Americans that are hospitalized for hip fractures yearly, rapid treatment of pain and surgical
intervention is critical to recover mobility and reduce the risk of death. Parenteral opioids are the standard of
care to manage acute hip fracture pain but increase the risk of adverse events and outcomes, including
delirium and recurrent opioid use. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) techniques, such as the
pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block, are an effective alternative to opioids that could be used for > 300,000
patients annually to decrease consumption of opioids and improve outcomes. However, utilization of UGRA in
the emergency department (ED) is primarily limited by ED-specific workflow challenges and lack of access to
the training required for competency. Thus, there is a clear need to increase utilization of opioid-sparing UGRA
for hip fracture pain, and it is likely that a technological advancement that reduces the training and workflow
requirements of administering UGRA is required to meet this need.
 During this project, an ultrasound-based hip regional anesthesia guidance system will be developed
under a quality management system (QMS) certified to ISO 13485:2016 and 21 CFR Part 820. The key
technological innovations underpinning the development of this product include the following: 2D and 3D
imaging algorithms that highlight bony anatomy and soft tissue landmarks, anatomical recognition capabilities
that automate injection site selection, a novel dual-array ultrasound probe that enables ‘through-the-probe’
needle trajectories, a single-use sterile consumable designed to simplify workflow, and a needle-visualization
imaging mode that highlights the advancing needle to the user. The primary technical tasks during the early
stages of the project period include the execution of end-user clinical usability studies to guide technical
specification development and implementation of machine learning networks to guide the PENG block.
Successful completion of these technical aims will result in the fabrication of pre-production systems for pre-
clinical validation studies that will be conducted later in the project period.
 Pre-clinical product validation activities will include cadaver and human-imaging studies performed in
collaboration with clinical experts who will verify that the system meets the requirements for the clinical
application. The primary endpoint for the pre-clinical cadaveric studies is a direct measurement of the accuracy
of needle placement for the PENG block, as confirmed by CT imaging. Additionally, a second pre-clinical study
using cadaveric specimens will characterize the learning curve required to reach competency with the system
by studying the needle placement accuracy achieved by 25 ED physicians over multiple simulated procedures.
 Completion of this research project will result in the development and fabrication of a human clinical-
trial-ready 3D-capable ultrasound-imaging system to support facile administration of UGRA for hip fracture pain
by minimizing training and workflow barriers to utilization."
10779945,"Myeloid neoplasms such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) may
over time transform from a chronic phase (CP) into, respectively, blast crisis (BC) or secondary acute myeloid
leukemia (sAML). Both of these conditions are poorly responsive to currently available therapies and novel
approaches are urgently needed. To this end, we have studied distinct mechanisms of BC/sAML transformation
to discover new targets and develop corresponding therapeutic approaches that prevent and cure disease
transformation. A common goal of all these studies is to eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that drive leukemia
growth and BC/sAML transformation. In addition to mechanisms of BC/sAML transformation intrinsic to LSCs,
we have recently gained insight into those that are extrinsic to LSCs and that involve transformation of the normal
bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (or niche) into a “leukemic” one. Herein, we focus on leukemogenic
mechanisms that induce T cells' loss of activity and exhaustion and that ultimately drive LSCs' escape from T
cells' antileukemic immune surveillance. To this end, microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that
target messenger RNAs and regulate levels of the corresponding proteins. MIR142, a highly conserved “gene”,
encodes miR-142, which is involved in the development and regulation of hematopoiesis and native and adaptive
immunity. In humans, MIR142 has been found mutated in lymphoma and AML, but not in CML or MPN. We
recently showed that miR-142 downregulation (deficit) occurs in CD34+CD38- LSCs from BC CML patients
compared with those from CP CML patients, leading us to postulate its contribution to the evolution of CP-LSCs
into BC-LSCs. While investigating these findings in mouse models, we observed that compared with the
Mir142+/+BCR-ABL mouse (a CP CML model), the Mir142−/−BCR-ABL mouse (a BC CML model) presented with
a profound T cell lymphopenia, and a significant reduction of T cell activity. To this end, we also observed: a.
reduced miR-142 level and activity in T cells from BC CML patients compared with those from CP CML patients;
b. an association of miR-142 deficit with increased PD-1 expression and T cells' exhaustion; and c. correction of
miR-142 deficit with a novel synthetic miR-142 mimic (CpG-M-miR-142), which restored the antileukemic activity
of T cells from both human and murine BC/sAML models. Thus, we hypothesize here that miR-142 deficit is
acquired by T cells during BC/sAML transformation and contributes to the phenotypic evolution of CML/MPN into
BC/sAML via mechanisms that allow LSCs to escape from T cell antileukemic surveillance. To prove our
hypothesis, we propose three specific aims (SA): SA#1: To determine the role of the T cells' miR-142 deficit in
BC/sAML transformation. SA#2: To dissect the molecular mechanisms through which miR-142 deficit mediates
T cells' loss of activity during BC/sAML transformation. SA#3: To target miR-142 deficit in T cells in order to
prevent and/or cure BC/sAML transformation. Our ultimate goal is to obtain IND-enabling evidence that CpG-M-
miR-142 is a novel targeting therapeutic that restores T cells' immunity, and in turn eliminates BC/sAML LSCs."

This K24 proposal will provide protected time for Dr. Grijalva to deliver high-quality mentoring to post-doctoral
and junior faculty investigators as well as to expand his studies of influenza transmission and disease
prevention. Dr. Grijalva proposes a comprehensive and dedicated mentoring plan that will facilitate the
effective transition of his mentees into independent academic careers. The application includes a detailed
description of plans to augment Dr. Grijalva’s own training through acquisition of advanced skills in mentoring,
and modelling of transmission of infectious diseases and causal inference. His current research projects are
thematically linked through their focus on acute respiratory infections, especially influenza infections, with a
strong emphasis on identification of modifiable risk factors to inform subsequent interventions. Influenza
remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The primary strategy to attenuate the impact
of influenza epidemics is vaccination, but vaccine effectiveness is suboptimal. Alternative methods to prevent
the spread of influenza are needed. Little is known about the transmission of influenza in US households and
communities in our modern lifestyle. Our understanding of influenza transmission is largely based on
household studies that were done in the 1960’s and 1970’s. Diagnostic tests have changed, and current
molecular and sequencing techniques allow accurate identification of influenza transmission. Similarly, contact
patterns within households and communities have likely changed during the last decades, and widespread use
of electronic devices may have further modified those dynamics. Understanding the contemporary drivers of
influenza transmission within US households and communities is the foundation for preventative interventions.
The NIAID strategic plan to prevent influenza infections and design a Universal influenza vaccine has identified
modern studies of influenza transmission as an important research priority. Although a large proportion of
influenza infections are acquired at home, the role of household environment, contact patterns, and disease
severity on influenza transmission have not been well studied. Contemporary household case-ascertained
studies are efficient designs to quantify transmission parameters and to study the role of these and other novel
modifiable factors. The research aims are: 1) Test the hypothesis that modifiable factors, including household
temperature, relative humidity, and within-household social interactions are independently associated with the
risk of influenza transmission in households; 2) To provide a comprehensive assessment of the use and
effectiveness of antivirals in the prevention of influenza transmission in households; 3) Test the hypothesis that
the disease severity in the index case (first patient infected in the household), and the household exposure
intensity and duration modify the risk of influenza transmission in households. These studies will inform the
design and evaluation of new prevention strategies, and will provide extensive opportunities for mentoring
junior investigators in patient-oriented research in influenza infections, transmission and prevention."

Social isolation is associated with a host of negative outcomes including increased rates of depression and early
mortality. Critically, social isolation can lead to maladaptive choices such as substance use as a coping strategy
for negative affect. Importantly, perceived connection with others can ameliorate adverse consequences of
isolation, potentially mitigating maladaptive coping mechanisms (i.e., substance use). Indeed, close connections
with others satisfy basic needs of belongingness and are associated with enhancing the reward value of social
experiences as reflected in reward-related neural circuits. While evidence in rodents suggests that the potential
for social interaction decreases the likelihood of substance use, there remains a critical gap in treatment
approaches in enabling substance-dependent individuals to form healthy social connections. This is in large part
due to: 1) neurobiological models of substance abuse have yet to widely integrate social context; 2) dynamic
social interactions are difficult to study in laboratory settings; and 3) a current lack of mechanistic understanding
how social rewards facilitate the development of social bonds.
Our proposal aims to delineate the mechanisms underlying the formation of social bonds as a precursor to
understanding how they may help sway maladaptive behaviors. We suggest that a critical aspect to forming a
social connection is developing a shared interpretation of reality, in which individuals begin to share similar
perspectives and preferences. We test this idea across 3 aims by first characterizing the basic mechanisms
underlying social reward-seeking behaviors using ecologically-valid stimuli (e.g., posting personal photos on
social media). We then use a naturalistic paradigm to create shared affective experiences and examine the role
of communicating shared preferences in forming social bonds in Aim 2. Finally, we recognize that shared
preferences may also make it difficult for behavior to change if such preferences converge on maladaptive
behaviors such as nicotine use. We explore this idea in Aim 3 by examining mechanisms underlying social
reward-seeking in a nicotine-dependent population, while also considering how shared preferences may impact
behavior. Taken together, the proposed studies will use ecologically-valid stimuli and naturalistic paradigms to
delineate the mechanisms of how social rewards, which signal shared preferences, shape social reward-seeking
behaviors, facilitate social connection and may mitigate (or promote) cravings for substances in nicotine users.
Importantly, this work will lay the groundwork for future proposals to investigate the role of the dynamics of social
connection in substance abuse."

During pregnancy, zinc deficiency is associated with an increased risk of infection. Streptococcus agalactiae,
also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), colonizes 20-30% of pregnant women. GBS vaginal colonization
increases the risk for stillbirth, preterm labor, and neonatal sepsis. One strategy that GBS may use to stably
colonize the reproductive tract is to produce biofilm, and we have found that GBS biofilm production is
suppressed in the presence of zinc. This proposal tests the hypothesis that GBS biofilm production is
negatively regulated by zinc, and this biofilm contributes to stable colonization of host tissues by limiting innate
immune responses against GBS. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will use mutagenesis and transcriptomic
approaches to identify genetic pathways regulating GBS biofilm. Aim 2 will define the impact of zinc-regulated
biofilm at the host-microbial interface by evaluating GBS mutants lacking cadD, a zinc efflux transporter, which
results in impaired biofilm production. We will examine these interactions using in vitro models of human
vaginal epithelial cells, explanted human fetal membranes, and an Instrumented Fetal Membrane Organ on a
Chip (IFMOC) model under conditions that modify zinc availability. Aim 3 will use a mouse vaginal colonization
model to define how the zinc transporter, cadD, impacts vaginal colonization in settings of zinc deficiency or
supplementation. Completion of these Aims will shed new light on how zinc impacts GBS-host interactions that
culminate in colonization (and infection) of the reproductive tract.
Dr. Ryan Doster is an Instructor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
His past work investigated gestational tissue innate immune responses to infection. This project will expand his
research focus to mechanisms of GBS colonization. This project complements Dr. Doster’s clinical training in
pediatrics and adult infectious diseases medicine. Under the mentorship of Dr. David Aronoff, Dr. Jennifer
Gaddy, and a multidisciplinary Scholarship Oversight Committee, Dr. Doster will master techniques including
bacterial mutagenesis, transcriptomics, and modeling infection within the reproductive tract to determine how
zinc alters bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Vanderbilt offers cutting-edge technology and expertise in
these areas through Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics and other shared research core
facilities. These studies and a strong career development program will prepare Dr. Doster for transition to an
independent researcher investigating the pathogenesis of bacterial infections during pregnancy."
10782522,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of effective self-regulation skills is one of the most important achievements of early
childhood. During infancy, key interconnected domains of self-regulation include emotion (i.e., distress
regulation) and feeding (i.e., caloric intake regulation). An important foundation for infants’ developing
capacities for self-regulation is caregivers’ sensitive responsiveness to infant behavioral cues, especially during
feeding. However, given the ubiquity of portable technologies (e.g., smartphones), it is likely that many
caregivers are distracted by technology while feeding their infants, which may lower sensitive responsiveness
to infant cues. Surprisingly few studies have examined possible effects of technological distractors on the
quality and outcome of early feeding interactions. The primary aim of the proposed research is to examine
impacts of maternal technology use on early feeding interactions and change in these impacts across early
infancy. We also aim to test the hypothesis that greater habitual maternal technology use will predict poorer
infant emotion and intake regulation when infants are 6 and 12 months of age, greater socioemotional and
behavioral problems at 12 months, and greater infant weight gain between birth and 12 months. In addition, we
aim to describe levels of and changes in habitual maternal technology use from the prenatal and early
postpartum periods and examine predictors of habitual technology use patterns. We propose a 15-month
longitudinal study with nested within-subject experimental studies and bursts of daily passive sensing of device
use and time diaries. Pregnant women will be recruited and assessed during their 3rd trimester of pregnancy,
then mother-infant dyads will be assessed when infants are 2wk, 4mo, 6mo, 9mo, and 12mo of age. At 2wk
and 4mo, mothers and infants will be observed feeding under 3 counterbalanced within-subject experimental
feeding conditions: 1) Control, 2) TV Use, 3) Mobile Device Use. Videos of these feeding interactions will be
coded to obtain a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of maternal technology use on maternal
attention, sensitivity to infant cues, and engagement of the infant, and on infant clarity of cues, attentional
responsiveness to the mother, and intake. Infant emotion and intake regulation, and related socioemotional
and behavioral problems, will be assessed via a combination of established behavioral protocols and validated
questionnaires. To describe patterns of habitual maternal technology use, we will integrate passive sensing
(via an app) of maternal technology use with time diaries; hypothesized predictors include maternal depressive
symptoms, stress, emotion regulation, feeding styles, and reflective functioning, and infant eating behaviors
and temperament. In sum, the proposed research is an innovative, multi-level examination of potential impacts
of maternal technology use on the quality and outcome of dyadic interactions during feeding. Findings from this
study will provide a foundation for further research aimed at understanding how to balance potential benefits
vs. drawbacks of technology use within family contexts."
10782523,"The CLC chloride channel family is a class of membrane proteins that controls the flux of
chloride ions across cell membranes. Nine unique CLC homologs are differentially expressed in
mammalian tissue and function in diverse physiological roles, ranging from electrical excitation
of muscles and neurons to regulation of electrolyte balance. One subtype, CLC-2, is a voltage-dependent channel expressed broadly in the brain. Although the presence of CLC-2 in the brain
has been known for decades, the role of this CLC homolog in neuronal signaling and proper
brain function remains poorly understood, in part due to the absence of potent and selective
small-molecule tools that enable studies of the molecular physiology of this channel. A recent
breakthrough in our laboratories now opens the door to developing small molecule tools specific
to CLC-2. Through a compound-library screen, we identified 'hit' compounds that inhibit CLC-2
activity. We developed one of these into a potent and selective CLC-2 inhibitor, FA44, which
has an IC50 of 18 nM for CLC-2 and no off-target effects on the closest CLC homolog or on a
panel of 65 CNS channels, receptors, and transporters. The efficacy and selectivity of FA44 for
CLC-2 is further supported by our electrophysiological recordings of brain slices from wild-type
versus CLC-2 knock-out mice. In this project, we will continue our collaborative efforts to
develop, characterize, and use chemical tool compounds for studying CLC-2. In Aim 1, we will
identify the mechanism of action and molecular determinants for inhibition of CLC-2. In Aim 2,
we will develop novel probes, including small-molecule activators and fluorescent imaging
probes for localizing channel expression. In Aim 3, we will leverage our tool compounds to
query the role of CLC-2 in excitatory synaptic transmission and network excitability in the
thalamus and to evaluate the potential causative link between CLC-2 malfunction and epilepsy.
Our team's combined expertise in synthetic chemistry (Du Bois), ion-channel structure-function
(Maduke), computation (Dror), and cellular neuroscience/epilepsy (Huguenard) ideally positions
us to advance this research program."
10782525,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are glutamate-activated, cation-selective ion channels that mediate the
majority of millisecond-time scale signaling in the nervous system. The iGluR family of receptors is composed
of three major subtypes, the AMPA, NMDA and kainate receptors, each of which plays a crucial role in nervous
system development and function. The disruption of normal glutamatergic signaling underpins multiple
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, depression, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Accordingly,
iGluRs are the targets for numerous therapeutic agents to treat seizure and mood disorders, as well as
schizophrenia. Several immunological disorders of the nervous system also involve iGluRs, with the most
prevalent being NMDA receptor encephalitis, a severe autoimmune disease for which there are few promising
treatments. Despite the widespread distribution of iGluRs throughout the human nervous system, and even
though they are involved in many debilitating neurological diseases and disorders, the molecular mechanisms
of iGluR function are not yet fully elucidated. Moreover, iGluRs are not isolated at their sites of function,
typically the synapses, but rather are found in complexes with multiple auxiliary proteins. Indeed, the
organization and molecular function of these auxiliary proteins also remains to be fully elucidated. Thus, the
major focus of the research proposed in this grant application is to elucidate the molecular structure and
mechanisms of function for AMPA and NMDA receptors, alone and in complexes with key auxiliary proteins.
Here we will develop methods to isolate native AMPA receptors from whole brain and from the hippocampus
and cerebellum, as complexes with their auxiliary proteins. We will then elucidate the structures of these
receptor complexes by single particle cryo-EM, using subunit specific antibody fragments to tag subunits. With
the structures in hand, we will design mutants to test important aspects of structure and mechanisms, carrying
out biochemical and electrophysiological experiments to probe receptor function. In parallel, we will also study
the NMDA receptors, here focusing on a structure-based mechanism for receptor gating, investigating the
structure of the GluN1/GluN2A receptor in complexes with the agonists glycine and glutamate, as well as with
allosteric modulators and ion channel blockers. Through these studies we aim to answer the question of how
neurotransmitters activate the receptor and how allosteric modulators increase or decrease receptor activity.
In parallel with AMPA receptor studies, we will also isolate native GluN1-containing NMDA receptors from
rodent brain tissue, with the aim being to elucidate the first structure of native NMDA receptors, mapping the
positions of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits in the receptor complex. Taken together, our studies will define
structure-based, biochemical mechanisms for iGluR function and they will lay the foundation for development
of new therapeutic agents."
10777858,"Abstract
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Angle closure, which impairs aqueous humor
outflow and leads to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), is the primary cause of 23 million or nearly one third of
all glaucoma cases. Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is three-fold more visually damaging than primary
open angle glaucoma (POAG), afflicting 6 million people with blindness. While most cases of PACG are
preventable with early intervention, current practice paradigms are severely limited in predicting which patients
with early angle closure, termed narrow angles, will develop PACG. Among key barriers hindering the care of at-
risk patients is reliance on gonioscopy, the current clinical standard for detecting angle closure. Gonioscopy is
subjective, qualitative, expertise-dependent, time-intensive, and uncomfortable. These limitations contribute to
underperformance of gonioscopy by clinicians, delayed detection of PACG, and blindness in a quarter of
diagnosed cases. Some racial groups in the United States are more vulnerable to PACG-related blindness;
Blacks and Hispanics are at 50% and 30% higher risk compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Recent landmark
studies also show that current disease definitions based on gonioscopy are weakly predictive of which patients
will develop PACG; over 100 “at-risk” patients require treatment to prevent a single case of PACG. This limitation
leads to poorly defined practice guidelines and confusion among clinicians regarding prophylactic treatment for
PACG, which, unlike POAG, is largely preventable. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more convenient
and precise clinical tool to prevent PACG-related blindness and mitigate disparities in disease burden. Anterior
segment OCT (AS-OCT) is a non-contact, reproducible, quantitative alternative to gonioscopy for evaluating the
angle. Our research group have been pioneers in clinical applications of AS-OCT for angle closure. We showed
AS-OCT measurements are predictive of elevated IOP, disease course, and treatment response, whereas
gonioscopy is not. More recently, we developed custom software to automate quantitative analysis of AS-OCT
images, thereby removing the barrier of manual analysis and unlocking the full potential of AS-OCT for clinical
care and scientific research. In this proposal, we seize the momentum of recent research findings and
methodological advances to shift practice paradigms and establish quantitative AS-OCT as the new clinical
standard for evaluating and risk-stratifying patients for PACG. Specifically, we will: 1) elucidate the anatomical
basis of disparities in angle closure using biometric data from a large multi-racial cohort; 2) establish quantitative
OCT-based definitions of narrow angles based on 3-year risk of elevated IOP and PACG; 3) identify novel
dynamic biometric risk factors to predict disease outcomes. Our proposed studies will address urgent needs by
clinicians for fundamental knowledge about disparities in angle closure disease and precise tools for delivering
care to patients at risk for PACG. Ultimately, these studies will help clinicians prevent PACG-related vision loss,
mitigate disparities in disease burden, and optimize utilization of healthcare resources."

at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako (USTTB) and leverage on existing
NIAID collaborative research programs in the two countries. The existing D43 training program has a focus
on malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), but does not include training and other capacity-building
in surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, and control of viral pathogens such as Ebola Virus Disease, COVID-19
and Lassa Fever. With maturation of our training and research on malaria and NTDs, and an increased supply
of highly qualified mentors and trainees in Mali, we propose an increased emphasis on training on EIDs in
Mali and Guinea and mentoring by Malian, Guinean and US researchers. This training program will
provide a curriculum for training doctoral and master’s students in advanced field epidemiology and
laboratory practices, as well as non-degree certifications (professional skill enhancement) in
translational clinical research, public health emergency management and genomic surveillance of
emerging infectious pathogens, preparing Guinea and Mali to better handle potential future
epidemics. This program is a south-south collaboration effort between Guinea and Mali, supported by Johns
Hopkins School of Public Health (JHSPH), to have researchers from both sides collaborate more closely on
these cross-border diseases for more coordinated and efficient public health responses. The training program
will support six doctoral students and 15 master’s students. Dissertation of Doctoral and Master thesis
research will include research questions related or applicable to Ebola and other EIDs. Supported students
will take courses from, and be mentored by, faculty from the University of Conakry, USTTB, and JHSPH.
Selected students will have the opportunity to take online courses at JHSPH that are not offered at the
University of Conakry or USTTB. The program will also provide faculty enrichment through training and
coursework for eight faculty members, which may include trainings or online coursework at JHSPH and
will provide laboratory training for five research scientists (students or faculty). Short courses will also be
offered twice per year, training 120 public health professionals and young scientists in topics related
to the control of EIDs. This support will greatly enhance capacity in Guinea and Mali to respond to and
control impending outbreaks of EIDs in their own countries, and in the West African region."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemoglobinopathy associated with severe bone abnormalities including
osteoporosis. Eighty percent of SCD adults have low bone mineral density (BMD) that is independent of risk
factors such as age, gender, and menopausal status, suggesting the etiology of osteoporosis in SCD differs from
the general population. Proposed contributing factors to bone loss in SCD include marrow hyperplasia secondary
to chronic anemia, inflammation, ischemia, and vitamin D deficiency. However, the mechanisms of bone loss in
SCD subjects has not been fully investigated, and there are no targeted therapies. Hormonal fibroblast growth
factor 23 (FGF23), which controls phosphate homeostasis and has direct and indirect effects on bone
mineralization, is reported to be increased in human anemia. Based on our exciting preliminary data showing
that increased serum FGF23 and hypophosphatemia in humanized Townes SCD mice, which are anemic
but not in renal failure, and that in vitro and in vivo FGF23 blockade partially rescues impaired
mineralization and improved reduced BMD in SCD mice, we posit that cross-talk involving bone marrow
erythropoiesis, kidney, and bone contributes to osteoporosis in SCD mice. Specifically, we posit that 1) sickling
of red blood cells and the resulting anemia causes increased erythropoietin production by the kidney, which
increases bone FGF23 production that impairs phosphate reabsorption; and 2) anemia-induced FGF23 results
in impaired osteoblast differentiation, mineralization, and bone strength in SCD mice due to hypophosphatemia
and pyrophosphate abnormalities via impaired sodium phosphate transporters PIT1 and PIT2 signaling in bone.
Furthermore, increased FGF23 reduces PIT1 signaling that can interfere with erythrocyte differentiation, further
perpetuating the anemic state. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine
the molecular mechanisms by which FGF23 contributes to phosphate wasting in SCD Mice; Aim 2: Assess the
molecular mechanism by which FGF23 contributes to impaired bone mineralization in SCD mice; and Aim 3:
Determine whether FGF23 neutralizing antibody modulates the anemia phenotype of SCD mice. Our proposed
studies may identify FGF23 as a novel contributor to the pathogenesis of bone loss and anemia in SCD mice.
Since the FGF23Ab is now FDA approved for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia, it may also be a
useful therapy to prevent bone loss and improve anemia in human SCD in the future."
10781949,"Project Summary/Abstract
Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium, affects 40
million girls and women in Africa. Parasite eggs migrate through mucosal tissue, inducing a host immune
reaction that leads to erosions and mucosal breaches of the female genital tract with symptoms including
genital discharge, bleeding, pain, and infertility. Chronic genital tract damage and symptoms persist after
praziquantel therapy in ~70% of women, even though praziquantel effectively kills parasite worms, reduces
excretion of eggs in urine, and resolves most tissue pathology in the bladder. In contrast, parasite eggs remain
trapped in genital tissue post-treatment where, from autopsy studies, they are known to induce a mucosal
immune response characterized by granuloma formation and fibrosis. FGS is a neglected tropical disease and
there are important knowledge gaps in our understanding of its cellular and molecular pathophysiology. We do
not know the profiles or functions of immune cells that respond to S. haematobium eggs in genital tissue, the
effects of FGS on the epithelial cell barrier, and if FGS-related cellular and molecular changes increase
susceptibility to viral genital tract infections. The rationale for this proposal is that addressing these knowledge
gaps could lead to targeted immunomodulatory, tissue reparative, or viral suppressive interventions to restore
damaged genital mucosa. Based on our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that S. haematobium eggs
in the genital mucosa modulate cervical immunity and decrease anti-viral immune cells, cause breakdowns in
the epithelial barrier, and increase recurrences of HSV-2, resulting in the morbidity and persistent symptoms of
FGS even after praziquantel therapy. To test this hypothesis, we will study 90 women with S. haematobium
infection and 90 controls without. Women with S. haematobium will receive praziquantel treatment at baseline
and during 12 months of follow up if persistent or recurrent S. haematobium is detected. We will pursue three
specific aims: 1) Define the genital mucosal immune cell composition in S. haematobium infection, before and
after praziquantel; 2) Determine the molecular mechanisms linked to breakdown of genital epithelial integrity in
women with S. haematobium infection; and 3) Quantify the effect of S. haematobium infection on the
frequency, intensity, and duration of genital HSV-2 reactivation. In the first aim, we will collect cervical cells by
brush and characterize cells by flow and mass cytometry. In the second aim, we will isolate epithelial cells
collected by cervical brush and perform RNA-Seq to elucidate genes and pathways specific to epithelial
integrity. In the third aim, we will quantify HSV-2 viral shedding over one month in women from the cohort who
are HSV-2 seropositive (n=90). In an exploratory analysis, we will also examine the vaginal virome by
metagenomic sequencing. The proposed research is significant because it may identify new therapeutic
targets for millions of girls and women with FGS. Further, it advances novel studies of parasites and viruses to
expand our understanding of interactions between helminths, mucosal immunity, and viral infections."

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated lung
pressure, right heart failure, and premature death. Current therapies fail to prevent disease progression due to
their inability to suppress and reverse obliterative lesions resulting from vascular remodeling. Previous studies
have centered on large arteriolar remodeling in vessels with a diameter >100 µm. However, the role of the
capillary bed (vessels <10 µm) in remodeling remains largely ignored. Pericytes (PCs) are indispensable mural
cells for maintaining capillary integrity and homeostasis. Our preliminary data showed that the loss of PCs
induced excessive capillary and arteriolar remodeling and manifested hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension
and right ventricular hypertrophy in transgenic animals. Additionally, human idiopathic PAH (IPAH) PCs showed
high proliferation and motility, and human IPAH induced-pluripotent stem cells (IPAH-iPSC) derived mural cells
lost PCs but gained more smooth muscle characteristics. Vascular organoids derived from IPAH iPSCs further
demonstrated a reduced number of endothelial cell (EC) tubes and increased smooth muscle coverage, which
recapitulated abnormal vasculature development without PCs. Single-cell RNAseq revealed upregulated
expression of the Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) in the IPAH PC cluster, which was validated in IPAH
PCs isolated from explanted lungs, hypoxic mouse PCs, and explanted IPAH lung tissues. Thus, we
hypothesize that RGS5 overexpression mediates PC dysfunction (detachment and migration) and, in
turn, capillary remodeling in IPAH. We proposed to 1) Characterize the impact of PC dysfunction on EC
dysfunction, vascular integrity, and remodeling in PC-depleted transgenic animals; 2) determine how RGS5
signaling regulates PC detachment, proliferation/migration, and EC interaction in clinical IPAH samples; 3)
Characterize the impact of RGS5 depletion on PC/EC cell-cell interactions in IPAH iPSC vascular organoids.
This project will provide novel insight into PC pathobiology in capillary remodeling and establish RGS5 as a
potential therapeutic target in PAH, for which the first drugs to treat this devastating disease may be found."

 Surgical sites infections (SSIs) are the most common hospital-acquired infection and result in 2 to 11-fold
increased mortality, an additional 9.7 days of hospital stay, and annual costs of 3.5 – 10 billion U.S. Dollars.
There are myriad techniques implemented to reduce rates of SSIs focusing on reducing skin pathogens.
However, if pathogenic bacteria arise from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract rather than skin flora, these preventive
interventions may be inadequate to reduce or eliminate SSIs. A lack of knowledge of the source of bacterial
pathogens limits our ability to personalize approaches to SSI prevention.
 There is a growing body of evidence linking the host microbiome to SSI development. Current evidence
suggests that skin and GI microbiota diversity may be more predictive of SSI development compared with
more traditional SSI predictors. These microbiomes represent a meaningful opportunity to target skin and GI
tract dysbiosis as a strategy to prevent SSI.
 The overarching goal of this research aims to prevent SSIs through interventions targeting the specific
source of pathogens and optimizing the host microbial environment. The central hypothesis is that the diversity
of the skin and incisional microbiota is predictive of SSI pathogenesis. The hypothesis will be tested through 2
specific aims. 1) First, the study aims to determine if diversity in microbial communities at the incision site is
associated with development of SSI by measuring the diversity and microbial community composition of the
incisional microbiome at different time points during surgery. Samples will be collected from 300 patients
undergoing open GI surgery. A case-control study will be performed comparing alpha diversity using 16S RNA
sequencing in 30 patients who develop SSI compared with 30 age-, sex-, diagnosis-, and wound class-
matched control patients who do not develop SSI. 2) Next, the study aims to determine if pathogenic strains of
bacteria causing SSI are present in the skin or GI microbiota at the time of operation. The strain of bacteria
isolated from a subset of 20 patients who develop SSI (from samples collected in Aim 1) will be identified using
shotgun metagenomics. Next, shotgun metagenomics will be used to determine whether that specific strain of
bacteria was present in the skin and/or GI tract immediately prior to operation.
 This is innovative and collaborative research assessing the association between SSIs and the microbiome.
As SSIs are a global concern, these findings with have global implications and impact. The results from this
study will provide important mechanistic details regarding SSI pathogenesis and whether pathogens are
present at the skin or GI tract at the time of operation. These results will be used to guide interventional studies
targeting modifiable microbiota features that influence SSI development. This study is the first necessary step
before performing prospective, interventional clinical trials which can be designed to underscore targeted SSI
prevention based on microbial communities."
10919820,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoporotic fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and their U.S. economic burden
is projected to reach $20 billion by 2025. Aging accelerates the decline of both muscle and bone, increasing
fracture risk. Understanding how muscle and bone interact anatomically, mechanically, and biochemically to
reduce bone strength could profoundly advance fracture prevention by identifying new fracture risk screening
and intervention targets to diagnose and treat age-related musculoskeletal decline. Computed tomography
(CT) scans hold great promise for assessing regional muscle and bone phenotypes to identify older adults at
high risk of fracture. Specifically, bone strength – a CT and finite element modeling assessment of 3D bone
morphology, bone mineral density (BMD), and cortical thickness – is a stronger predictor of fracture risk than
BMD alone. Building on the Study of Muscle, Mobility & Aging (SOMMA), the proposed SOMMA-CT ancillary
study is uniquely positioned to explore how thigh and trunk muscle properties from CT (via automated and
radiomic analysis), D3Cr muscle mass (D3-creatine dilution), muscle performance, as well as circulating muscle-
bone crosstalk biomarkers, relate to changes in bone strength at the hip and spine (2 clinically-relevant fracture
sites). SOMMA is a prospective study examining aging-related muscle biology contributions to mobility disability
(R01 AG059416). This ancillary study in 360 SOMMA older men and women (ages 70-94) will employ an
efficient and cost-effective longitudinal design that adds: 1) a 4th-year follow-up CT scan and blood draw, and
2) advanced processing of baseline and 4-year CT scans and blood samples to extract new longitudinal
muscle and bone phenotypes. Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine if muscle quantity and composition (CT-
derived thigh and trunk muscle area, muscle density, intermuscular fat, and radiomic texture features of muscle
heterogeneity; D3Cr muscle mass) are associated with changes in hip and spine bone strength over 4 years of
aging. 2) Determine if muscle performance (leg extensor specific power; 4-m gait speed; time to complete 5 chair
stands) is associated with change in hip and spine bone strength over 4 years of aging. We will also explore
how biomarkers of muscle-bone crosstalk (myokines: aminobutyric acids; osteokines: CTX-1, P1NP) relate to
bone strength both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and test if these biomarkers mediate the muscle-bone
associations in Aims 1-2. The scientific premise is that thigh and trunk muscle degeneration will be associated
with declining hip and spine bone strength, and that circulating biomarkers will offer mechanistic insights on
muscle-bone crosstalk contributors to bone strength. This investigation in an aging cohort will increase our
knowledge of the dynamic interrelationships and crosstalk between muscle and bone. New discoveries in this
area could impact over 158 million older adults worldwide who are at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This
work has strong potential to shift clinical practice paradigms by improving predictive power in fracture risk
screening and identifying new phenotypes in muscle and/or bone which could be targeted to prevent fracture."
10744808,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Program
The Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Program at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC) was
created in 2003 and received a merit rating of Outstanding to Exceptional in 2015.The mission of this program
is to discover basic mechanisms that control the interactions between cancer cells of viral and non-viral
etiology and their microenvironment, leading to the identification of molecules or pathways that can be
targeted for therapeutic interventions. The program has three scientific aims: 1) To investigate the
fundamental mechanisms underlying cancer cell, immune cell and stroma cell interactions & communications;
2) To investigate the pathogenesis of cancer viruses and their immune escape mechanisms; and 3) To
investigate the mechanisms underlying tumor immune escape and develop new approaches for cancer
immunotherapy. The TME Program continues to be co-led by W. Martin Kast PhD who brings expertise in
cancer virology & cancer immunology. The strategic recruitment of new co-leader Rongfu Wang PhD in 2019
expanded expertise in cancer immunotherapy, innate immune signaling, and immune cell epigenetics. Together,
they promote intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations through Program meetings, retreats, seminars, and
pilot funding mechanisms. The TME Program brings together 35 members from 10 departments in four schools
at USC with expertise and research interest in tumor-stroma interactions, metastasis, inflammation,
angiogenesis, cancer computational modeling, cancers induced by viruses (HPV, KHSV, HCV), and cancer
immunology and immunotherapy. A unique aspect of this basic science Program is its commitment to clinical
translation. In the current funding period, basic science discoveries by TME members led to four investigator-
initiated clinical trials in the TACS and CCR programs. Research by the members has a unique impact on specific
populations of the LA County catchment area, particularly children (neuroblastoma and childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)), Asians (liver cancer), and Hispanic women (breast cancer & HPV-induced
cervical cancer). Also noteworthy is the collaboration with NCCC’s Cancer Research Training and Education
Coordination (CRTEC) Program to provide TME-led cancer education of a very diverse group of students ranging
from elementary school to junior faculty mentoring. During the current funding period, Program members have
published 283 papers, of which 23% are intra-programmatic, 27% are inter-programmatic, 34% are multi-
institutional and 29% are published in high impact journals including Nature Medicine, J. Clinical Investigation,
Nature Communications, PNAS, JAMA Oncology, Cancer Discovery, Cell Metabolism, Hepatology, J Extracell
Vesicles, ACS Nano, Cancer Res and Clinical Cancer Res. Program members hold $13.1M in cancer-related
funding (direct costs); $11.2M is peer reviewed, of which $4.4M is from NCI, representing increases of 34% for
overall and 49% for peer-reviewed (NCI funding remains strong and stable in this grant period)."
10744809,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Community Outreach and Engagement (COE)
The Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center
(NCCC) addresses the cancer-related community health needs for our catchment area of Los Angeles County
(LAC), where 84% of NCCC patients reside. COE supports NCCC’s mission to reduce the cancer burden in
our catchment area and beyond through research, education, outreach, and dissemination. To establish
and align NCCC strategic priorities with the cancer burdens and unique disparities in our catchment area, COE
leveraged data from the NCI-funded Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP), our ongoing Community Needs
Assessment, a community environmental scan, and input from our Community Advisory Board (CAB). NCCC
priorities include: prostate, breast, lung, liver, and colorectal cancers, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia
as well as behavior change priorities, including obesity, tobacco/vaping, and HPV/cervical cancer
prevention. NCCC COE has the following Specific Aims: 1) to define, assess, and monitor cancer-relevant
needs of our catchment area; 2) to foster catchment-relevant research, education, and outreach; 3) to enhance
enrollment of diverse, underrepresented community members across the lifespan in cancer-related research,
including clinical trials; 4) to elevate the impact of NCCC research through policy/advocacy for our catchment
area; and 5) to extend our reach beyond the catchment area. Signature achievements include: 1) in 2019
alone, we partnered on initiatives with 30 community-based organizations and disseminated educational
materials to 290 community-based, patient-centered, and government organizations throughout LAC; 2) led or
participated in 162 events, reaching a total of 519,782 individuals; ~80,000 individuals were engaged through
social media, and over 600,000 were reached through Univision COE Spanish language television
appearances; 3) fostered the new NCI U54 CaRE2 Health Equity Center (U54CA233465) as co-director of a
COE Core; 4) contributed to the new NCI U19 prostate cancer RESPOND study in African American men by
fostering recruitment (U19CA214253); 5) catalyzed and contributed to several cancer-related R01-level peer-
reviewed grants and seven of eight NCI CCSG P30 supplements awarded in the current grant period; 6)
developed six cancer-specific mini-monographs to monitor the cancer burden in the catchment area; 7) fostered
recent major NCI grant submissions including an NCI Moonshot grant on engagement of Hispanic colorectal
cancer patients in genomics research and an NCI P20 on liver cancer disparities in Hispanics (October 2020);
8) fostered strong accrual of underrepresented minorities and individuals across the lifespan to clinical trials;
and (9) impacted public policy by participating in tobacco control coalitions in Los Angeles, Long Beach and
Pasadena, testifying to pass bills on restricting electronic cigarette flavors and on prohibiting access to electronic
cigarettes where combustible cigarettes are prohibited. COE extended its reach to the Toiyabe Tribe in Monyo
County (CCSG Supplement) and to Amerindian tribes living in Los Angeles and the Central Valley."
10744810,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation
At the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC), overall responsibility for planning and evaluation
rests with the Director, Caryn Lerman PhD, who sets the vision and strategic processes to intensify the growth
and impact of NCCC’s cancer research, training, and community impact. Lerman transformed the Senior
Leadership team with well-defined roles and responsibilities, enhancing the culture of engagement, input, and
continuous improvement. Advisory bodies include the Executive Committee, Research Leadership Council,
Strategic Planning Steering Committee, External Core Advisory Committee (new), Community Advisory Board
(new), and the External Advisory Board. Program, Cross-Program, and Center retreats foster team science and
drive the impact of NCCC research to address the cancer burden and disparities in our highly diverse catchment
area. Informed by these committees, Senior Leaders led several evaluation and transformation processes during
this cycle, including: 1) development of a new NCCC Strategic Plan (SP); 2) reassessment of NCCC membership
to improve cancer focus; 3) restructuring of Research Programs to achieve the goals of the SP and foster
transdisciplinary collaboration and impact; 4) evaluation of Shared Resources, resulting in closure of three
facilities and addition of two new Shared Resources (one newly implemented and one in development); 5)
creation of new Offices for Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) and Cancer Research Training and
Education Coordination (CRTEC); and 6) introduction of a Cancer Service Line Executive Committee and a new
Funds Flow model to NCCC. Building upon the prior strategic plan, Senior Leaders led a Center-wide process
culminating in the NCCC Strategic Plan (2020-2025). Selected achievements in aligned initiatives include: 1)
recruitment of 40 new leading scientists in the current grant period; 2) greater Senior Leadership involvement in
clinical trials, with growth in interventional accruals to 1171 in 2019 (increased from 816 in 2015) and strong
enrollment of minorities (61.6% of interventional trial accruals); 3) integration of catchment-relevant research into
all NCCC research programs and attainment of $10M of funding for cancer disparities research; 4) investment
of $8M in a new Translational Team Science Accelerator Program to catalyze paradigm-changing cancer
science; 5) deployment of a process to prioritize advancement of novel potential targets and biomarkers, with
ten novel potential therapeutic targets now in various stages of development; 6) procurement of a $20M+
investment to construct and staff a cGMP facility to fuel immunotherapy research; 7) development of a new
Population Research Shared Resource and expansion of the Data Science Shared Resource to include
bioinformatics; and 8) creation of a new translational cancer genomics platform and enhancements to the
Molecular Genomics Core, now an NCI-designated Genome Characterization Center. These processes
have catalyzed the NCCC’s strategic growth (18% increase in overall cancer research funding and 11%
in peer reviewed funding), cancer focus (22% increase in NCI funding – direct costs), and capability to
reduce cancer burdens in our catchment area and beyond."
10744811,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Developmental Funds
Developmental Funds (DFs) add significant value to the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC)
members who conduct basic, translational, clinical, and population research. Specifically, we utilized CCSG DFs
in the current grant period to recruit 11 new faculty members, to support seven CCSG pilot projects, and to
catalyze a restructuring of our bioinformatics platform, leading to the expansion of the NCCC Biostatistics Core
into a full-service Data Science Shared Resource (SR). Notably, DFs were utilized, in part, to support the cluster
recruitment of John Carpten PhD and colleagues from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)
who competed successfully for several new grants including a new NCI U54 Center for Health Equity which
integrates faculty across all five NCCC Programs. CCSG DFs were augmented by substantial institutional
investments to foster high impact collaborative research with emphasis on addressing cancer burdens and
disparities in our catchment area. The return on investment (ROI) for CCSG DFs in the current period is 21:1
and contributed to the increase in NCI funding by 22%, peer-reviewed funding by 11%, and overall cancer
related funding by 18% (direct costs). The process for awarding DFs is led by Administration with final
decisions made by the NCCC Director with input from Senior and Program Leaders. There are notable
improvements in this process during the current grant period. First, based on the NCCC Strategic Plan,
targeted areas for DF-supported faculty recruitments are identified by the Executive Committee and faculty
are recruited through a systematic search process. Second, the new Director refreshed the Scientific
Review Committee for DF-supported pilot projects; this committee reviews and scores all applications for
internally-funded pilot award opportunities. Further, the new Associate Director for Administration enhanced
the pilot awards process, from the distribution of RFAs, to review and decision-making, and finally to the
tracking of metrics of success for DF-supported members. Tracking of metrics of success for faculty recruits
and pilot grants has been enhanced substantially through the recruitment of a seasoned research
administrator. In this application, we request ($1,375,000) to support strategic faculty recruitments ($1M)
and developmental pilot projects ($375K), to be supplemented by institutional investments, as we did in the
current project period. The new NCCC Strategic Plan, “Shaping the Future of Cancer Science 2020-2025”,
will guide these future investments, with a focus on specific priorities: interventions to reduce cancer
disparities, cancer therapeutics/drug and biomarker development, and translational and clinical
research in immune-oncology. As in the current period, we will maintain a sharp focus on recruiting faculty
who are underrepresented in medicine."
10744812,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Shared Resource Management
The USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC) has a long tradition of providing innovative and cost-
effective Shared Resources (SRs). NCCC Administration manages all SRs with Senior Leadership oversight
to ensure alignment with the NCCC Strategic Plan and a sustained scientific impact. An integrated set of
oversight processes, combined with the annual core survey, fosters continued improvement and SR evolution
to meet members' needs. In response to these mechanisms, we have transformed NCCC SRs in the current
grant period, including expansion of the Biostatistics SR into a Data Science SR, creation of a new Population
Research SR, and transition of three SRs that had relatively lower use by NCCC members to the Keck School
of Medicine. Accordingly, the six CCSG Shared Resources proposed in this application include: Flow and
Immune Monitoring Core (FCIM), Liquid Biopsy Core (LBC), Translational Pathology Core (TPC),
Molecular Genomics Core (MGC), Data Science Core (DSC), and Population Research Core (PRC). We
also propose a developing Preclinical Core to provide NCCC members with customized preclinical services to
generate robust preliminary data for grant proposals and to provide a rationale and information to inform the
design of novel early phase clinical trials. Notably, we have made substantial investments in our SRs, with a
strong return on this investment as exemplified in our annual usage metrics and annual core surveys.
Specifically, 168 (of 187) full NCCC members utilized at least one NCCC SR in FY19 (80% of these 168
members had peer reviewed funding), and 77% reported that their satisfaction with the overall quality of the
services was either outstanding or very good (top two categories). Use of NCCC SRs directly contributed to
642 publications. The CCSG budget contribution to NCCC shared resources is only 24% of the total SR
operational budget over the current period, with the remainder supported by institutional funds and
chargebacks or grant support. The institutional investment to NCCC SRs in the current grant cycle was over
$5.2M."
10744813,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM)
At the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC), the Clinical Investigations Support Office (CISO)
serves as the centralized clinical trials office for all cancer trials, independent of originating department or disease
team. The senior CISO leadership includes Anthony El-Khoueiry MD who serves as the Medical Director,
Kevin Kelly MD who serves as the Assistant Medical Director, and Zeno Ashai MBBS MPH who was appointed
as Associate Director in 2019. CISO has three units: the Quality Assurance and Compliance Unit, the Regulatory
Unit and the Research Operations Unit. CISO also supports the four clinical research oversight committees
(Clinical Investigations Committee, Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, Quality Assurance Committee, and
Phase I Committee). In the current period, CISO created a role for Disease Team Managers who supervise
research staff and support the ten Disease Teams in Step 1 of Disease Team protocol reviews. Notably, CISO
also expanded and enhanced services to support investigator initiated trials (IITs) over this grant period,
including: new protocol development support (design and feasibility consultation meetings), addition of a protocol
writer, Medidata Rave database development for interventional protocols, and multisite coordination services
(enabling NCCC to serve as a coordinating site for multi-site IITs when appropriate; 14 such trials coordinated
in 2019). Additional accomplishments over the grant period include: 1) an extensive CISO reorganization with
addition of 20 full time employees (FTEs), enabling expansion of services cited above; 2) full implementation of
the OnCore clinical trials management system; 3) a 43.5% increase in interventional trial accruals from 816
patients in 2015 to 1171 in 2019 (of which 223 (29%) were IITs); 4) a 57% decrease in time to activation from
42 weeks in 2015 to 18 weeks in 2019; 5) improvement in the quality of IITs that reduced the disapproval rate at
the initial PRMS review from 35% in 2015 to 17% in 2019; and 6) substantial accrual of minorities in interventional
trials (61.6% of 2019 accruals are from minority groups underrepresented in clinical trials). Despite the COVID-
19 pandemic, 659 patients were accrued to interventional trials from 1/1/2020 to 11/30/2020."
10744814,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)
At the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC), PRMS functions are performed by the Clinical
Investigations Committee (CIC) which serves as the Center's scientific review committee. The CIC is co-chaired
by Drs. Syma Iqbal (TACS) and Ann Mohrbacher (TACS). All cancer protocols undergo a two-step review prior
to submission to IRB. Step 1 is a standardized Disease Team (DT) review coordinated by the Clinical
Investigations Support Office (CISO) DT managers. In the current grant period, we revamped the Stage 1
process to standardize the reviews and enhance interactions between DTs and NCCC Research Programs,
particularly the Translational and Clinical Sciences (TACS) Program. If the protocol is approved by the DT, it
proceeds to Step 2, the scientific review by the CIC. Only protocols that receive approval by the CIC can be
submitted and reviewed by IRB. The accrual of women, minorities, and patients across the lifespan is considered
at each step of the process as an evaluation criterion, as is catchment area relevance. In 2019, CIC reviewed
117 clinical trials, 25 of which were institutional or externally peer-reviewed. Important new PRMS developments
in the current cycle include: a new mandatory “design and feasibility consultation meeting” for investigator-
initiated trials (IITs) which ensures early input from biostatisticians and CISO leadership; usage of a newly
updated standardized protocol template; and more rigorous DT oversight. In addition, a rapid activation pilot
program for select high priority early phase trials was instituted in 2018-2019 with time to activation of 8-10
weeks. Once protocols are activated, they are monitored for accrual and scientific progress by the Scientific
Progress and Accrual Monitoring Subcommittee of the CIC based on an established NCCC accrual monitoring
policy. Key accomplishments resulting from these process improvements include: 1) activation timelines have
decreased by 57% from 42 weeks in 2015 to 18 weeks in 2019; 2) average time from new protocol CIC review
meeting to completion of CIC review decreased by 80% (from 5 weeks in 2015 to 1 week in 2019); and 3) a
dramatic increase in the number of interventional trials closed for poor accrual (from 11 in 2015 to 20 in 2019
and 40 in 2020). Low accruing studies that were permitted to remain open met specific criteria, such as an
adequate remedial plan that resulted in improved accrual on subsequent monitoring or prior strong overall
accrual that slowed down due to cohort closures. Future plans include: a) further efforts to reduce time to
activation; b) expansion of support for IITs including protocol writing support (initiated in 2020) to enhance the
quality and speed of trial development; and c) a new CIC mentorship program to train junior faculty to become
CIC members and reviewers."

10744818,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Translational Pathology Shared Resource
The mission of the Translational Pathology Core (TPC) of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center
(NCCC) is to facilitate high-impact cancer research by providing high-quality human tissue procurement,
processing, and banking resources to NCCC investigators working on all aspects of cancer research. Continuing
as the Director of TPC since its inception in 1998, with oversight from NCCC Administration, Sue Ellen Martin
MD PhD ensures that services are provided in a timely and cost-effective manner and that TPC meets the needs
of NCCC members. TPC team members work with investigators in all NCCC Research Programs on the
planning, design, and feasibility of cancer research studies requiring human biospecimens and procure tissue
for NCCC clinical trials. A unique service offered by TPC is the acquisition of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded
(FFPE) tissue from patients enrolled in population-based studies, including non-USC hospitals. In addition to
retrieving blocks from specific patients for population-based studies, TPC collects FFPE tissue blocks that are
donated by regional hospitals to TPC's Residual Tissue Repository (RTR) and linked to the NCI-funded Cancer
Surveillance Program (SEER registry) at USC/NCCC. The ethnic and racial diversity of the biospecimens
available to investigators fosters NCCC's mission to reduce cancer disparities. For example, TPC has ~1,800
and 2,800 annotated breast cancer tumor blocks from African Americans and Hispanics, respectively, and the
RTR includes over 60,000 multiethnic cancer patient specimens. New developments in the current period
include: 1) deployment of a centralized bioinformatics tool, OpenSpecimen; 2) enrollment for CAP/CLIA
certification; 3) launch of an automated investigator database queries for specimens to decrease turn-around
time; and 4) implementation of a universal consent process in collaboration with the NCCC Oncologic Research
Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) program. During the current grant period, 84 NCCC full members across
all five NCCC Programs utilized TPC resulting in 82 publications and $19.4M in direct cost grant funding related
to TPC usage. For example, TPC supports ORIEN at NCCC, providing annotated FFPE tumor tissue blocks
from over 2,471 consented adult patients for whole genome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq)
with matched whole blood samples for germline WES. TPC also provides essential pediatric tissues not
otherwise available to investigators, including fresh Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, and sarcoma tissues as well
as over 5,000 leukemia samples. TPC is also critical for the NCI UM1 (National Clinical Trials Network) and UG1
(Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network) at NCCC. The anticipated annual budget of TPC in the first
year of the next grant cycle is $991,870 yet the CCSG request is $403,984. Accordingly, TPC leverages

10744820,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Population Research Shared Resource
The mission of the newly proposed USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCC) Population Research
Shared Resource (PRC) is to maximize the impact of NCCC's research on priority cancer burdens and disparities
in the catchment area and beyond, by consultation and coordinated access to unique local and national
population-based data resources and assessment tools. The NCCC strategic planning process and 2018 annual
core survey identified member needs for a state-of-the-art Shared Resource (SR) to provide consultation,
access, and support for leveraging population-based data resources. To respond to this need, NCCC created
PRC in February 2019, overseen by NCCC Administration and led by Myles Cockburn PhD, recruited to NCCC
and appointed Director of PRC. As PRC Director, Cockburn advertises to and ensures access by NCCC
members; oversees and evaluates the effectiveness, timeliness, and impact of PRC services; and ensures
integration with other NCCC SRs. Key services provided by PRC this grant cycle include: 1) surveillance study
consultation and access to data on catchment area cancer burdens; 2) geospatial linkage and analysis to assess
recruitment feasibility, target interventions, and monitor intervention effects at individual/neighborhood level; 3)
access to and interpretation of medical claims data (in SEER Medicare) and California's prescription and hospital
discharge data (linked to LA CSP); and 4) consultation on collection, preparation, and analysis of novel individual-
level naturalistic data (ecological momentary assessment (EMA), accelerometry and UV dosimetry). In response
to feedback from NCCC members and aligned with the NCCC Strategic Plan, in the next grant cycle, PRC will
run training sessions for clinical investigators on the use of EMA and other technologies in clinical research
studies, including studies to improve survivorship (i.e., physical activity, reducing obesity, and assessing mood).

10771855,"This “G-RISE at The University of Mississippi” seeks to establish an interdisciplinary biomedical sciences
training program at the University of Mississippi (U-Miss). The DIRECT (Diversifying Interdisciplinary drug and
device development Research Expertise through Community building and Training) Program aims to increase
diversity in the biomedical research workforce and to prepare strong Ph.D. graduates who are well-prepared
to enter a career in the biomedical field. The doctoral programs of the participating departments have
successfully placed graduates in a wide range of career paths. However, overall, less than 9% of the admitted
students belong to underrepresented minority (URM) populations, which is consistent with the percentage of
URM’ students admitted into STEM fields at U-Miss. The relatively low number of applications received from
domestic students, considering the diversity in the state of Mississippi, and the current degree completion
rates, demonstrate the need to seek out and foster a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for
our trainees. Currently, there are no T32 predoctoral training programs at U-Miss; thus, the DIRECT program
will develop a critical infrastructure to support graduate students from diverse backgrounds pursuing degrees in
the biomedical field. The proposed Program builds on the expertise of a diverse group of expert faculty
mentors who are significantly invested in graduate student mentoring. They have research expertise in drug
discovery, product development, device design, safety and efficacy testing, and evaluation of efficiency. In
addition to mandatory Program-specific didactic courses, training activities will include several nondidactic
components. Through career and professional development activities, trainees will be equipped with the
necessary skills to work in a diverse environment, interact with role models to gain insights into career paths,
and build self-confidence. The Program will provide holistic, evidence-based, and team-oriented learning
opportunities in this multidisciplinary scientific area. The Program will recruit and enroll three new trainees from
underrepresented groups (URGs) every year and support them financially for three years through program
funding. All trainees will be supported to degree completion through institutional funds after program
completion. Trainees selected for this Program will be chosen competitively based on academic excellence
and their interest and motivation for careers in the biomedical field. Thus, the specific objectives of this
Program are to i) Recruit and enroll a diverse pool of trainees from underrepresented groups through
active and targeted recruitment activities, ii) Develop trainees' ability to create, assimilate, analyze, and
think critically, iii) Enhance trainee professional skills and career readiness, and iv) Retain and
graduate trainees in an appropriate timeframe. In summary, this training program is designed to develop a
diverse group of scientists with the resources and skills needed for successful careers as independent
scientists and educators in the biopharmaceutical workforce."

This is a competing renewal application for the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA)-
Neuroimmune consortium (Notice# RFA-AA-20-011, RFA-AA-20-013) to integrate multidisciplinary research
projects based on the genomic, cellular, and behavioral neuroadaptations related to excessive alcohol
consumption. This consortium has identified gene networks and pathways associated with excessive alcohol
drinking in humans and animals and focuses on potential drug targets within neuroimmune and
neuroinflammatory signaling pathways. In the next phase of this initiative, our collective proposals will address
several documented NIAAA goals which include: 1) understanding the genomics, electrophysiology, and
pharmacology of brain immune signaling systems in neurons and glial cells and their role in causes and
treatments of alcohol dependence; 2) using new technologies such as single cell and spatial transcriptomics,
proteomics, and multimodal functional and structural imaging to study these systems; 3) promoting
reproducibility and translation of data through testing in multiple laboratories and in multiple assays; 4) guiding
investigators in determining the translatability of their findings for preclinical and clinical studies by NIAAA-
supported units outside the consortium. The overall hypothesis for INIA-N is that systematic analysis of
neuroimmune mechanisms will inform strategies for treatment of excessive drinking associated with Alcohol
Use Disorder. Ten Research Components and an Administrative Core comprise the consortium. INIA-N will be
directed by the Administrative Core in cooperation with the Executive and Steering Committees and guided by
a distinguished Scientific Advisory Board. The Administrative Core will provide leadership, oversight of
scientific projects, and integration and translation of project data. INIA-N has six goals: 1) expand gene
expression datasets with results from single nuclei sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to generate cell-type
specific and anatomical transcriptome maps and integrate human cellular transcriptome data with human
genome wide association studies; 2) define the contribution of specific non-neuronal cell types (astrocytes and
microglia) to the molecular and behavioral effects of excessive alcohol consumption through a collaborative
investigation of immune related cells of the brain; 3) examine alcohol-induced changes in perineuronal nets
and in the abundance and post-translational modifications of extracellular matrix proteins as mechanisms for
glial-neuronal cross talk that impact brain circuits regulating alcohol consumption; 4) pursue biochemical and
electrophysiological studies of cytokine signaling to understand innate immune mechanisms by which
excessive alcohol consumption changes brain function; 5) apply systems-level, connectomics approaches to
identify mechanisms by which excessive alcohol consumption changes whole brain function, with emphasis on
the role of our top neuroimmune genes; and 6) propose and prioritize drug targets and compounds for
advancement to testing in animals and in humans by NIAAA supported entities outside the INIA-N consortium."
10774263,"Abstract
The routine use of cross-sectional imaging has resulted in a dramatic increase in the age-adjusted incidence of
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) over the last decades. However, this has not translated into a decrease in cancer
specific deaths, which suggests over treatment of potentially indolent renal tumors. Thus, active surveillance
(AS) of RCC is now accepted as a management option for renal tumors, particularly in patients with
comorbidities. Although AS in larger tumors has been reported to be safe (i.e. very low risk of metastasis), the
natural history of these tumors remains unknown and percutaneous biopsies may be limited in assessing tumor
grade due to intrinsic heterogeneity. Tumor angiogenesis and lipogenesis have been correlated with prognosis
and metastatic potential in clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common and aggressive type of RCC. Inactivation
of the VHL gene, HIF upregulation, and VEGF over-expression form the molecular basis of the enhanced
angiogenesis associated with ccRCC. More recently, progress has been made in recognizing the distinct role of
HIF-1 and HIF-2 transcription factors in tumor progression and inhibition of HIF-2, the main driver of
angiogenesis, is now been tested in humans. Similarly, upregulation of lipogenic enzymes has been recognized
as an aggressive metabolic phenotype in ccRCC. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) method for measuring blood flow by manipulating the signal from inflowing arterial blood. ASL blood flow
correlates tightly to vascularity in ccRCC. Dixon-based techniques have been extensively validated for
quantification of hepatic lipids. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) provides an indirect non-invasive estimate of
tumor cellularity. We seek to identify cellularity, vascular, and lipid MRI measures in ccRCC in vivo that correlate
to spatially-co-localized molecular alterations promoting angiogenesis and lipogenesis and predict aggressive
behavior. The spatial co-localization of various tissue-based analyses with in vivo alterations in tumor perfusion
and lipogenesis may help develop more robust imaging biomarkers to predict the biologic behavior of ccRCC. If
successful, these imaging biomarkers will be immediately applicable to clinical practice and will help selecting
patients for active surveillance thus decreasing the number of unnecessary surgeries."
10774265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder (prevalence 1 in 250) that requires lifelong
sustained medical care. Evidence-based guidelines for screening and treatment for FH exist. These include
universal screening of children ages 9-11, of adolescents ages 18-20, and of adults ages 40 and above;
approved diagnostic tools including lipid panels and genetic testing; and recommendations for initiation of lipid
lowering medication. FH diagnosis is currently made too late in life, often after a premature heart attack has
occurred creating a care gap that results in excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diagnosing FH in
the primary care setting would optimize treatment for individuals with FH and close this care gap. Utilizing tools
from implementation science and human centered design, and by considering uptake, acceptability, and
sustainability of programs related to FH care should improve earlier diagnosis. Implementation strategies that
include insights from patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems are necessary. Our long-term goal is to
create an effective FH diagnosis program that is practical and sustainable in the real-world setting. The main
objective of this project is to determine the uptake of an FH diagnosis program integrated into primary care
practices to promote early identification of adult and pediatric patients that is generalizable to other healthcare
settings. Our research question is, does using a multi-level implementation strategy package, designed to
address the specific needs of patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems, improve the diagnosis and
activation of care management for individuals with FH. Our specific aims are to: 1) to design a clinical trial to
assess multi-level implementation strategies for improving FH diagnosis in an integrated health system, 2)
compare FH diagnosis rates among primary care clinicians who receive the implementation strategy package
versus those who do not, 3) to measure implementation success of an organized FH diagnosis program, and
4) to explore patient-related service and health outcomes related to an FH diagnosis program."

bioethics, and participation diverse seminar series that will include me giving presentations, interacting with
visiting outside speakers, and attending journal clubs.
 The overarching hypothesis of this project is the following: The Hippo pathway is a central regulator of
gastric epithelial homeostasis and response to injury. We propose to address these Specific Aims with regards
to the role of the Hippo pathway in the gastric epithelium: 1) To address the sufficiency/necessity of the Hippo
pathway in maintaining normal, mature gastric epithelium cell identity during homeostasis and following injury
and the molecular pathways the interact with the Hippo pathway in driving acute dedifferentiation phenotypes
(gene expression, cell shape, cell proliferation). 2) To describe the role of the Hippo pathway in gastric
organoid growth and stemness. We will also address discovery of novel regulated and direct targets of
YAP1/TAZ in this in vitro metaplasia model."

 Various cellular processes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide, which are key mediators of signaling pathways. Dysregulated redox
homeostasis and ROS generation are hallmarks of diseases including cancer and age-
associated degeneration. Primary cellular targets of ROS are cysteine thiols that form sulfenic,
sulfinic, and sulfonic acids, as well as disulfides. ROS generation is localized to specific cellular
regions, and are short-lived, necessitating spatiotemporal methods to study cysteine oxidation
events. We have developed a chemical-proteomic strategy, termed isoTOP-ABPP, to study
diverse oxidative cysteine modifications. To provide the necessary spatiotemporal readout, we
will expand our current isoTOP-ABB platform by: (1) utilizing caged cysteine-reactive probes
that can be activated rapidly by light for temporal control of cysteine labeling; and, (2) adapting
the TurboID proximity biotinylation method to spatially localize our analysis to specific regions of
the cell. We will apply these spatiotemporal readouts to two ROS-generating systems in the cell:
(1) growth-factor mediated activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX); and, (2) inhibition of the
electron transport chain (ETC) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase.
 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to EGFR, activates ROS release via NOX2. We
aim to identify cysteine oxidation events proximal to NOX2 and characterize the role of these
oxidation events on growth-factor signaling. In early studies, we identified a redox-active
disulfide bond in a fatty-acid binding protein, FABP5, which is formed upon EGF stimulation of
A431 cells. We will investigate the effects of disulfide-bond formation on the lipid-binding
properties of FABP5, and downstream signaling pathways mediated by growth-factor
stimulation.
 The mitochondria are highly redox-active organelles, and we aim to provide a
comprehensive view of oxidation targets during mitochondrial dysfunction, by selectively
enriching mitochondrial proteins prior to analysis. We will apply our optimized mitochondrial
methods to interrogate cysteine oxidation in a C. elegans SOD-2 mutant with elevated
mitochondrial ROS, and extended lifespan."
10782980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. Phages have been shown to play
important roles in the life cycle of many bacterial pathogens, particularly water-borne pathogens that cause
gastrointestinal tract infections. For example, the lysogenic phages, which integrate their DNA into the host
genome, can play positive roles by providing virulence factors such as toxins that enhance the virulence of
their host bacterium. Other phages known as lytic or virulent phages can play negative roles by infecting and
killing their host bacterium, thus reducing the number of the pathogen below the threshold needed to cause
disease. Vibrio cholerae is a water-borne pathogen that infects the small intestine to cause the severe
diarrheal disease cholera. Although it is well known that a lysogenic phage called the CTX phage enhances
virulence by providing the genes encoding cholera toxin, our recently published and preliminary data indicate
a pervasive negative role for several virulent phages that are commonly found in cholera endemic areas
around the Bay of Bengal. These virulent phages appear to reduce the virulence, transmission, and potentially
dissemination of V. cholerae. However, there is much we still do not know about these phages in terms of
their ability to kill V. cholerae in the environment, to inhibit fecal-oral transmission of cholera such as occurs
frequently within households, and their impact on the emergence of new V. cholerae strains. In this project,
we will investigate each of these areas. In addition, we will study the importance of another lysogenic phage
called Kappa in the virulence of V. cholerae."

Our competing renewal proposal seeks funds to continue to support attendance of Trainees and Young
Investigators (YIs) at the Annual Meeting of the Perinatal Research Society (PRS). The PRS provides career
development through two separate, but interrelated endeavors. One is a two-day grant writing program funded
by R13HD079163 which occurs immediately preceding the Annual Meeting of the PRS. The second is the PRS
YI Program funded by R13HD036244. It is the second program that we seek continued NIH R13 support. The
Specific Aims of the Annual Meeting of the PRS that foster career development are based in its design and
execution as follows: Aim 1) YI acknowledgement and interactions with PRS Members. PRS members are
typically experienced faculty and mentors, with many leaders in the field of Reproductive Biology. Numerous
activities are designed to encourage interactions between the YIs and PRS Members. Aim 2) The speaker
program. Speakers present the latest research in their field. All presentations are in one room and there are no
“concurrent” sessions. Aim 3) The early career speaker program. Three or four YIs give presentations at the
Annual Meeting. Aim 4) Ongoing mentoring through the Associate Membership process. In recognition of the
long career path to independence we realize failing to support the YI's after the end of the meeting is not the
best path to success. We follow up with a Council review of all YI attendees and offer continued mentorship by
Associate Membership of the society. This allows attendance and full participation in future years. We also
follow up at least twice a year with email contacts to monitor career progress for workshop attendees. We have
invested in the PRS Associate Member Paper Prize, which is given to the top three papers published by an
associate member in the preceding year. Winners are provided complimentary registration to the next PRS
meeting. Finally, as Associate Members obtain their independent grant funding, they transition to Regular
Membership in the PRS. The need for this kind of opportunity for early career development is significant
because of the challenging current academic and funding environment. The impact of our YI program is that it
allows participants to make tangible and immediate progress in developing and expressing their research ideas
and then translating that into scientific presentations, collaborations, and new mentor-mentee relationships. It
is in the Main Meeting that they become integrated into the society."

The development of site specific nucleases for precise gene engineering has advanced basic understanding of
genes and their connection to phenotype-causing mutations and physiologically relevant endpoints and
treatment strategies to cure human diseases and medical disorders. It is critically important to mention that the
safe and efficient delivery approaches ensure the utilization of these programmable nucleases, thereby
improving the therapeutic potential of gene therapy. There are some terrific delivery systems and vesicles that
include viruses and viral captives that take advantages of their ability to target particular cell types. Nanoparticles
such as lipid nanoparticles, peptide nanoparticles, and gold nanoparticles can allow encapsulation of the
molecules for the delivery. However, still clever ways to try to address challenges in delivery of molecules are
required. We propose a revolutionary approach to realize controlled delivery of Cas9-ribonucleoprotein

effectively, and safely for cell engineering in vitro and in vivo. The goal of this project is to develop a gas
vesicle (GV) and ultrasound based delivery approach (GVUS) to improve cell viability and cargo delivery
efficiency by conjugating GVs and purified RNP and monomeric streptavidin fusion protein (RNP-mSA-bioGV) to
form protein clouds for precise delivery using optimized ultrasound excitations after the investigation of
ultrasound parameters to induce stable oscillations and cavitation of GVs. GVs are biocompatible and intact for a
long time due to their stability while immediate clearance is available upon brief sonication. Stable oscillations
and cavitation of GVs under ultrasound excitation will be used for controlled disruption of cell plasma membrane
for intracellular delivery. In specific aim 1, we will investigate GV dynamics under different ultrasound excitations
and find optimized ultrasound parameters to generate stable oscillations and cavitation of GVs. We will test
various delivery modes using optimized parameters. We will develop RNP-mSA-bioGV protein clouds for
controlled delivery of RNP for gene editing, followed by the characterization of the protein clouds in specific aim
2. Primary mouse T cells will be engineered using developed protein clouds delivered by GVUS to study gene
editing precision and in vitro anti-tumor activities of engineered T cells to assess the feasibility of the proposed
approach in specific aim 3. An innovative approach to use protein clouds controlled by ultrasound will
revolutionize the current delivery techniques to engineer cells for research in laboratories and clinical
applications. Although many cell therapies have significant challenges in manufacturing and cost, we expect that
GVUS approach combined with protein clouds will contribute to realize simpler and cheaper patient-specific and
cell-based therapy."
10780832,"Asthma affects 8% of the United States population >60 years and causes considerable harm: older adults are
4 times more likely to die from asthma and have twice the risk of hospitalization. The burden of asthma is
notably greater among minoritized older adults. Research suggests that perception of expiratory airflow
limitation may be a major determinant of asthma outcomes in older adults, and that older adults are
substantially less aware of airway obstruction than younger adults. These observations suggest that perception
of airflow limitation is a potential target for improving outcomes of older patients with asthma; however, there
has been very limited research in this area. We completed a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an
intervention that trains older adults with asthma to better perceive expiratory airway obstruction through
feedback via peak expiratory flow (PEF) prediction and couples this feedback with motivational interviewing
(MI) to promote change in asthma self-management behaviors. Compared to an attention control, the
intervention improved PEF, perception of airflow limitation and asthma control. In this project, we propose to
conduct a fully powered RCT to test the intervention’s efficacy in a large cohort of older adults with asthma and
understand the mechanisms underlying improvements in asthma control and objective measures of expiratory
airflow. The Specific Aims are to (1) Test the impact of the intervention on perception of expiratory airflow
limitation in older adults with asthma, (2) Examine the efficacy of the intervention for improvements in lung
function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and PEF), self-reported asthma control (Asthma
Control Questionnaire [ACQ] scores), quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] scores), and
emergency department and hospital use, (3) Test the intervention’s impact on mean daily ICS dose used (daily
maintenance and as needed) and illness beliefs. We will conduct a RCT of 300 older (≥60 years) patients with
uncontrolled asthma who are on controller medications (daily maintenance or as needed) recruited from
underserved inner-city practices and randomize them to an intervention consisting of PEF feedback training
and MI (with or without a booster session at 6 months) or a time-matched attention control group. The
intervention will be delivered for 3 sessions over 6 weeks. Control patients will receive supportive counseling
related to their asthma and standardized, untailored asthma education during 3 individual sessions. Data will
be collected at baseline, 1-month, 6-months (primary analyses of effectiveness) and 12-months post-
intervention. In secondary analyses, we will test the sustainability of treatment effects with vs. without the
booster treatment session (active booster vs. attention control booster) delivered immediately after the 6 month
assessment on outcomes at 12-months. The project addresses a significant public health problem in a
vulnerable patient population. The innovative intervention addresses a significant public health problem among
patients who are rarely the focus of interventions to improve asthma outcomes."
10779022,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Worldwide, over a billion people each year experience high morbidity and/or mortality from the effects of
human fungal pathogens. People with AIDS, chemotherapy patients, and transplant recipients are at highest
risk of acquiring life-threatening infections, but many fungi also cause disease in apparently healthy individuals.
Among these is the spore-forming yeast, Cryptococcus, which is ubiquitous in the environment. Like many
pathogenic fungi, Cryptococcus causes disease when it is inhaled into the lung. From the lung Cryptococcus
can disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS) and cause fungal meningoencephalitis that is fatal ~25%
of the time, even with state-of-the-art treatments. In the United States the case mortality rate overall from
invasive fungal diseases is ~50%, indicating the dire need for improved therapeutic strategies. To develop new
antifungal therapeutics, we need to identify novel fungal-specific molecules or pathways. Thus, it is imperative
that we gain a better understanding of the fundamental biology of pathogenic fungi, especially the development
and growth of spores. Our long-term research goal is to understand how infectious spores survive in new
environments, including the mammalian lung, and use that information to identify fungal-specific targets for
therapeutic interventions. To accomplish this goal, we have developed the Cryptococcus system as a model
for the study of infectious spores. The objective of this proposed project is to determine the molecular
processes by which infectious spores transition into vegetatively growing yeast (germinate) and how this
process influences disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that determining the molecular mechanisms of
germination will identify key pathways in spore-mediated infections that can be targeted for inhibition. To test
this hypothesis, we will carry out three Specific Aims: 1) Determine the molecular pathways and processes
required for spore germination, 2) identify the molecular processes and events that promote germination
competence of spores, and 3) determine the effects of spore germination kinetics on host-pathogen
interactions and disease progression. We will combine molecular and classical genetics, gene expression
analyses, chemical genetics, protein composition analyses, and quantitative germination assays to reveal the
developmental and regulatory mechanisms that facilitate spore survival in diverse environments. At the same
time, we will use in vitro tissue culture models and a mouse intranasal model of infection to determine how
spores infect and escape the mammalian lung. These innovative experiments will result in an in-depth map of
spore pathways and insights into how spores invade the host. Understanding pathways and processes
associated with spore germination makes significant contributions to the long-term objective of this work to
identify new and diverse molecular targets that can be exploited for novel antifungal therapeutics and
strategies to prevent and/or treat cryptococcosis and other fatal human fungal diseases."

A large and increasing number of people in the US are impacted by neurological disorders, such as major
depression, anxiety, autism, Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit disorder; moreover, the global burden of
disease attributable to drug addiction continues to rise. Decades of research and drug development have shown
that these diseases and disorders can be treated using drugs that modulate neurotransmitter availability. Many
of these therapeutics block neurotransmitter reuptake or antagonize receptor signaling by acting on plasma
membrane transporters and receptors. Unfortunately, many highly addictive substances such as amphetamines
also bind to these proteins, but their mode of action is poorly understood and thus we are unable to combat their
deadly effects. Synaptic vesicles (SVs) store neurotransmitter in presynaptic neurons, which are released into
the synapse to propagate neuronal signaling. SV transport proteins are also required for neurotransmitter release
as they load neurotransmitter into SVs, rendering them fundamental components in the regulation of
neurotransmitter signaling. Despite their importance, we still know very little about the underlying molecular
mechanisms of SV transporter function. Our work aims at providing a detailed and comprehensive understanding
of the molecular mechanisms of SV transporter function. Unfortunately, nearly all SV transporters have been
recalcitrant to biochemical and biophysical characterization and thus far, most have eluded high-resolution
atomic investigations by any structural methodology. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is the only
transporter expressed in the central nervous system that loads biogenic amine containing neurotransmitters such
as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine into SVs. To tackle SV transport-associated diseases head-on, we
will perform detailed structural and functional analysis on VMAT2, revealing its structure in several
conformational states representing key intermediates in the transport cycle. The studies proposed here will
illuminate the molecular mechanisms of VMAT2 in neurons and reveal the structural basis for how inhibitors and
substrates bind. We will address these objectives by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Structural studies of VMAT2
in complex with the inhibitor tetrabenazine; 2) Determine the structural basis of reserpine inhibition; 3)
Demonstrate how neurotransmitter and amphetamines are transported by VMAT2 by determining structures in
various substrate-bound and apo conformational states. Our anticipated results promise to deepen our
understanding of neurotransmitter binding and membrane transport mechanisms and provide necessary atomic
information about this family of proteins, localization of the molecular determinants, and modes of drug
interaction to guide the development of new inhibitors with fewer side effects and greater specificity."

All pathogens require proteins to cause disease. Protein abundance reflects a delicate balance
between synthesis and degradation critical for pathogenesis and antibiotic tolerance. Protein
degradation must be tightly controlled because its effects are irreversible. We aim to determine
how related bacterial species, including the human gastroenteritis- and murine typhoid-causing
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, deploy proteolysis as an essential virulence strategy.
We will investigate how the master virulence regulator PhoP controls the abundance, activity, or
specificity of all five ATP-dependent proteases: Lon, HslUV, ClpAP, ClpXP, and FtsH. We will
examine how the PhoP antagonist EIIANtr is proteolyzed in a phoP- and lon-dependent manner
and identify the role that proteolysis of PhoP and EIIANtr plays in the expression kinetics of
virulence genes when bacteria are inside macrophages. We will uncover proteins and behaviors
controlled by the poorly understood virulence-promoting protease HslUV; critically test the role
that proteolysis of gene silencer H-NS plays in expression of foreign genes; and solve the
mechanism(s) by which protease adaptors prevent protein degradation during infection. We will
identify the signals governing expression of virulence proteins CspI and IraP via their 5' leader
mRNAs and define the domain(s) of the virulence protein MgtB mediating growth in very low
Mg2+ and survival in Slc11a1+/+ macrophages. The proposed research program takes a
comprehensive approach, including technical and conceptual innovations, to reveal significant,
broadly applicable principles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis and new therapeutic
interventions that overcome antibiotic resistance."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) contributes to high morbidity and mortality in children with diverse
cardiopulmonary and systemic diseases. Efforts to define optimal treatment strategies for pediatric PAH have
been limited by the absence of multicenter randomized controlled trials (MRCTs) and the lack of well-defined and
proven endpoints for studies in children. Pediatric PAH remains understudied and relatively little is known about
long-term outcomes, age-appropriate clinical endpoints and optimal therapeutic strategies for children. Drug
treatment remains suboptimal as MRCTs are rare in children with PAH and current decision-making is dependent
on data from adult studies or small case series in children. Based on recent success of MRCTs in establishing a
new standard of care for adult PAH patients, we propose to study the potential role for initial up-front combination
treatment of PAH in children consisting of two PAH-specific oral therapies that have been shown to be well-
tolerated in children as monotherapies: sildenafil (a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and bosentan (an
endothelin receptor antagonist). Recent studies in adult PAH suggest that initiation of combined therapy with a
phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor and an endothelin receptor antagonist at the time of diagnosis, rather than
sequential combination therapy, improves pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise tolerance and quality of life when
compared with monotherapy. Children with PAH often require additional therapies over time in the setting of
disease progression or incomplete responsiveness to monotherapy, however, there are no data regarding the
potential benefits of greater and more sustained clinical improvement over time with the more aggressive
combination therapy approach from the time of initial diagnosis. Studies of pediatric PAH have been further
limited by the lack of well-coordinated and experienced care programs and the relative rare nature of these
diseases. With the collaboration of the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet), a highly interactive
and multidisciplinary group of academic PH programs, we propose to test the hypothesis that initiation of
up-front combination therapy with sildenafil and bosentan at the time of PAH diagnosis will result in
improved WHO Functional Class (FC) at 12 months in comparison with the current standard approach,
which is sildenafil therapy alone. Overall, this study addresses critical gaps in pediatric PAH by testing a clinical
strategy with strong potential for broad impact, and by defining useful study endpoints or novel surrogates that will
facilitate evidence-based decision-making and enhance the care of children with PAH."

Although >11 million family/friends are caregivers to >6 million people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-
Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), they do not typically receive personalized education, strategies and support to
manage their own wellbeing and complex dementia-related symptoms. Lack of personalized care contributes
to $321 billion annually in AD/ADRD care costs. In response, our company, Plans4Care, Inc, proposes a Fast-
Track SBIR (PAS-22-196) to build and test a digital platform that delivers personalized care plans to caregivers
on a smartphone, tablet or computer. To generate a personalized care plan, caregivers select a care challenge
(from >50) they seek to address, and respond to brief, easy-to-answer questions (assessment). A novel clinical
algorithm, developed by Plans4Care, maps the challenge and assessment results to the company’s database
of >1,000 evidence-based strategies. A resultant personalized care plan contains education about the care
challenge and specific strategies modifying the environment, communications, tasks, and/or activities.
Caregivers also have access to trained dementia specialists (care advisors) for one-on-one tele-support as
needed. Phase I will develop and evaluate a prototype. Phase I specific aims include: Aim 1: Develop a
clickable prototype with clinical algorithms that map 5 common care challenges to brief assessments and
evidence-based strategies to generate tailored care plans; and Aim 2: Determine feasibility (able to use
platform to identify challenge/generate care plan), acceptability (appeal, appropriateness), and usability (able
to navigate), using focus group and survey methodologies involving validated measures with 25 diverse
caregivers (racially, ethnically, age, relationship, geography). At the conclusion of Phase I, quantitative
milestones (go-no go) to transition to Phase II are: 1) 25 caregivers enrolled; 2) 75% complete assigned
Plans4Care task: onboard, identify care challenge, generate care plan (feasibility); 3) 75% rate Plans4Care
acceptable; and 4) 75% rate navigation easy-to-use (usability). During Phase II, we will ascertain if embedding
Plans4Care into large geriatric primary care practices (part of accountable care organizations) results in
improved caregiver wellbeing and reduced acute care utilization by people with AD/ADRD, and a commercially
viable product. Phase II specific aims include: Aim 3: Incorporate Phase I feasibility feedback to complete
the build out of the platform to address all 50+ care challenges, and develop our solution into a commercial
product; and Aim 4: Conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial (n=160) to evaluate if Plans4Care
improves diverse caregivers’ wellbeing and reduces acute care utilization of people with dementia. This aim
will formally provide evidence for the platform and its implementation in primary care/ACOs. Our company was
competitively selected to participate in the NIA Healthy Aging Start-Up Bootcamp. The commercialization
potential of an easy-to-use tool providing personalized care that is integrated into ACOs is unique and
desperately needed in the marketplace."

“Phase 1 Trial to Assess Safety and Immune Effects of Xenon Gas in Healthy Human Subjects”
ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging evidence
shows that homeostatic dysregulation of the brain immune system, especially that orchestrated by microglia,
plays a significant role in the onset and progression of the disease. Microglial function is maintained in healthy
brain and is pathogenically dysregulated in AD brain. The prominent genetic risk factor, APOE, is involved in
microglial function. We have recently identified a unique molecular signature for homeostatic microglia and have
developed robust tools to investigate microglial biology in health and disease. We also identified a role for the
APOE-signaling in the regulation of a new microglial subset associated with neurodegeneration and in microglia
surrounding neuritic Ab-plaques in human AD brain, which we have termed MGnD. The major question relates
to microglia-based approach to treat AD is how to modulate microglia phenotype and function. Preservation of
neuronal cells from Aβ-induced apoptosis as well as restoration of resident microglial homeostatic function is
critical for the restoration of brain function.
 The goal of this proposal is to perform Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of Xe inhalation in
healthy normal volunteers given at increasing durations of exposure: 20, 40, 60, and 90 minutes. Xe is currently
used in human patients as an anesthetic and as a neuroprotectant in treatment of brain injuries. Xe penetrates
blood brain barrier, which can make it effective therapeutic. Our preliminary data demonstrated that Xe delivered
through inhalation: 1) modulates microglia from an MGnD to homeostatic phenotype in an acute
neurodegeneration model and in AD mice; 2) ameliorates AD-like pathology associated with decreased Ab-
plaques in APP/PS1 mice; 3) reduces APOE4-induced neurodegeneration and decreases brain atrophy in
P301S mice and 4) decreases monocyte infiltration and suppresses their proinflammatory response.
Mechanistically, we found that Xe treatment polarizes homeostatic microglia toward an intermediate state
(MGiS), via induction of microglial responses to IFNg signaling. Importantly, we identified the optimal PK/PD of
Xe inhalation treatment in an acute model of neurodegeneration and in AD mice. Successful completion of this
clinical trial proposal will be the first step of evaluation of xenon inhalational therapy in humans and will allow to
move to its evaluation in AD patients for safety and efficacy, leading to raising private-sector capital and initiation
of Phase 2 clinical trials in AD. Thus, we propose the following specific aim:
Aim: To evaluate the safety of Xe inhalation in healthy normal volunteers given at increasing durations

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a major neglected tropical disease that is associated with clinical manifestations
ranging in severity from relatively benign lesions to chronic highly ulcerated lesions to metastatic disease.
Optimally, drug treatment would eliminate the parasites, but drugs developed to date fail to induce sterile
cure and are often woefully inefficient at controlling the disease. Our new data strongly suggests that
optimal control of cutaneous leishmaniasis requires a response that not only effectively eliminates the
parasite, but also reduces the potential for immunopathology. In a series of publications, we have outlined
the role of CD8 cytolytic T cells in driving inflammation by upregulating the inflammasome and inducing the
release of IL-1. Thus, our studies indicate that an immunopathologic pathway involving the inflammasome
and IL-1 production is a major driver of disease. We further found that blocking NLRP3 or IL-1 in
experimental models of severe cutaneous leishmaniasis ameliorates pathology mediated by CTLs without
blocking protective immune responses, suggesting that either would be excellent targets for host-directed
immunotherapy that could be used in conjunction with conventional anti-parasitic treatments. However,
significant gaps in our knowledge of this pathologic response remain. Here we will utilize a combination of in
vitro and in vivo approaches that will identify the cells undergoing inflammasome activation, determine the
proximal signals that activate NLRP3, and define the chemokines that maintain this chronic
immunopathologic response. To accomplish this in Aim 1 we will determine which cells contribute to NLRP3
dependent pathology during cutaneous leishmaniasis disease progression by defining when
inflammasomes are activated following infection, identifying the cells involved and determining which cells
are required for disease-promoting inflammasome activation. In Aim 2 we will identify the triggers of NLRP3
inflammasome activation in cutaneous leishmaniasis. Finally, we found that the chemokines CCL3 and
CCL4 are associated with treatment failure in patients, and therefore in Aim 3 we will determine if these
chemokines drive the chronicity of cutaneous leishmania lesions by promoting CD8 T cell or regulatory T
cell recruitment to leishmanial lesions. Our proposed experiments have clear translational significance since
they are founded upon substantial data obtained from leishmaniasis patients and are designed to identify
the essential cells and signals required for disease. Such information will allow for a more specific targeting
of immunopathology in leishmaniasis and identify additional targets for host-directed therapies in this
chronic infection. Finally, these studies will be of more general significance, as this pathologic pathway is
not unique to cutaneous leishmaniasis."
10760261,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Characterized by progressive cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia,
primarily affecting the aging population. Inflammatory activation of microglia is an early pathological feature of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and contributes to brain damages. However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate
microglial inflammatory activation in Aβ-rich milieus are not completely understood. Stimulator of interferon
genes (STING) is an innate immune adaptor protein that is abundantly expressed by cells of myeloid origin
including microglia. Despite its roles in interferon-based antiviral immunity, recent studies have revealed an
important contribution of STING signaling to inflammatory damages in non-communicable disorders. cyclic GMP-
AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor and signals through STING to promote interferon
signaling and production of inflammatory mediators. Cytosolic accumulation of endogenous DNA especially
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments constitutes an important source of endogenous “sterile” activator of
cGAS-STING signaling. In our preliminary study on patients and an AD animal model with AD-like
amyloidopathy, we observed increased microglial STING activity, which contributed to early microglial activation
in 5xFAD mice. In addition, microglia from patients and 5xFAD mice demonstrated cytosolic mtDNA
accumulation; and deficiency of cGAS attenuated microglial STING activation in 5xFAD mice, implicating an
association of cytosolic mtDNA sensing by cGAS with STING activation. Finally, our data suggest that microglial
mitochondrial stress in Aβ milieus may contribute to mtDNA instability and leakage into the cytosol. We therefore
hypothesize that microglial STING signaling triggered via cytosolic mtDNA sensing by cGAS contributes to Aβ-
induced microglial activation, culminating in neuroinflammation and neuronal stress in AD. Here, we aim to
establish a link between microglial STING activity and microglial activation in 5xFAD mice. Next, we will
determine the contribution of microglial STING activation to microglial deregulation-associated brain damages
in 5xFAD mice. In addition, we will address the mechanisms that mediate microglial mtDNA release in Aβ-rich
milieus and determine the importance of mtDNA leakage for the activation of microglial cGAS-STING signaling
in Aβ-rich milieus. Taken together, the results from this study will answer important questions about STING in
shaping microglial phenotype, and will suggest a novel mitochondrial mechanism of microglial activation and
new avenues for the treatment of AD."

Through this K22 Career Development Award proposal, I seek further mentored research training while
developing career skills to facilitate a successful transition to research independence. Therefore, this proposed
plan is tailored to extend beyond my skillset developed during my postdoctoral fellowship at the NHLBI beyond
metabolic studies and into immunology. This proposal takes advantage of the outstanding scientific environment
in my mentor’s lab and at the NHLBI to learn new techniques, including next-generation sequencing analysis,
advanced flow cytometry, histopathology, and proteomics. To train in these methods and assist with the research
aims, I have established collaborations with other labs and several NHLBI core facilities. Furthermore, a career
development plan is included to ensure thorough preparation for an academic position by cultivating my oral and
written communication, mentorship, and lab management. Advisory Committee has been assembled consisting
of my primary mentor and several other prominent scientists, who not only have extensive scientific experience
in fields related to the T cell biology and cellular metabolism, which are proposed in this grant, but have also
committed to guiding presentations, job applications, and negotiation strategies. This training will help me to
secure a tenure-track position at an extramural institution.
 The research goal of this proposal is to dissect the roles (Aim 1) and the detailed mechanisms (Aim 2) of
mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in CD4 T cell differentiation and functions and to further evaluate the
translational applications of altering FAO levels in T cells (Aim 3). T cells are central to cell-mediated immunity.
The dysregulation of T cell differentiation and related functions leads to a variety of immune-related diseases,
such as cancer, infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The differentiation of T cell subsets is
associated with metabolic rewiring. Metabolic rewiring is a bioenergetic adaptation to different conditions and a
hallmark of T cell differentiation is FAO, a major catabolic process that degrades long-chain fatty acids. I have
recently generated conditional knockout mice with an endothelial FAO deficiency, and have demonstrated that
FAO is a critical regulator of endothelial cell fates both in vitro and in vivo. Another genetic mouse model with a
T-cell-specific FAO deficiency has also been produced. Using this novel model, combined with cutting-edge
biochemical techniques, I seek to fill the gap in our knowledge of the molecular basis of FAO in the regulation
of T cell differentiation and related functions (Aims 1 and 2). Furthermore, the goal of Aim 3 is to evaluate the
translational potential of altering FAO levels in T-cell-associated disease models. This proposal is of profound
significance because, by answering the fundamental questions of how FAO controls T cell differentiation and
functions, it will lay a solid foundation for the development of new metabolic-based therapeutic approaches for a
wide range of immune-related diseases. Upon transition to independence, the findings from the proposed
research will be used to prepare an NIH R01 grant application."
10761798,"Abstract: Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is caused by BCR-ABL1, a constitutively active
fusion kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the ATP site of BCR-ABL1 are effective in treating
chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) yet minimally effective at treating blast-phase CML and Ph+
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the 20 years since the approval of the first TKI in all of medicine, imatinib, TKIs
have dramatically improved survival of patients with CP-CML, resulting in a projected increase of CML
prevalence from 70,000 Americans in 2010 to 180,000 in 2050. Despite this progress, TKI-resistant CML remains
a challenge, with >1,000 deaths annually in the U.S. At least 50% of TKI treatment failure arises through
mutations in BCR-ABL1. Laboratory studies on the five FDA-approved BCR-ABL1 TKIs have established their
mutational profiles against the >30 mutations observed in patients. In aggregate, these TKIs cover the clinical
spectrum of BCR-ABL1 single point mutants. Ponatinib is the only TKI that is clinically effective against the T315I
gatekeeper mutant. However, BCR-ABL1 compound mutants, defined as 2 mutations in the same BCR-ABL1
allele, that include T315I with any second mutation are resistant to all approved TKIs, including ponatinib, leaving
these patients with no further treatment options. Asciminib is the first inhibitor in clinical development that binds
the BCR-ABL1 myristoyl site, an allosteric site distant from the ATP site, to enforce an autoinhibited, inactive
conformation. We established that asciminib, like ponatinib, is not effective against T315I-inclusive compound
mutants, yet combining ponatinib (but not nilotinib or dasatinib) with asciminib is extremely effective at inhibiting
many T315I-inclusive compound mutant forms of BCR-ABL1. This discovery provides the basis for a novel
therapeutic strategy to address an entirely unmet medical need and is the foundation of this proposal. In Aim 1,
we will use computational, biophysical and crystallographic methods to decipher how ponatinib re-sensitizes
compound mutant BCR-ABL1 to asciminib. We will test the combination in relevant mouse models and in primary
leukemia samples. In Aim 2A, we will develop a therapeutic strategy for clinically resistant BCR-ABL1 compound
mutants that are not inhibited by the combination of ponatinib with asciminib. Instead, we will target these mutants
for proteasomal degradation using an asciminib proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) strategy. Unlike TKIs,
PROTACs are effective even upon transient or weak binding. We will test the hypothesis that ponatinib-induced
stabilization of the myristoyl site is the initiating event that allows subsequent binding of an asciminib-PROTAC
and proteasomal degradation of compound mutant BCR-ABL1. In Aim 2B, we will develop a ponatinib-PROTAC
strategy for compound mutants carrying a myristoyl site resistance mutation. Our work will provide a rationale
for clinical evaluation of ponatinib combined with asciminib as a therapy for currently untreatable BCR-ABL1
compound mutant leukemia. Compound mutations are also a major cause of resistance in acute myeloid
leukemia, melanoma, and lung cancer, and our study will provide a blueprint for treating these malignancies."

The project Neuropathologic-Epidemiological Study of Metallomics and Alzheimer's Disease (RF1AG054057)
demonstrated for the first time that pro-oxidant iron directly measured in human brain is strongly associated
with cognitive decline in older persons with AD pathology. In this proposed continuation, we propose to further
these studies to resolve mechanisms underlying brain iron elevation, susceptibility to iron-mediated damage,
and resultant decline. Underpinning our hypothesis is the recently discovered programmed death pathway,
ferroptosis, which causes destruction of synaptic and cellular membranes by iron dependent peroxidation of
certain lipids. Strong preliminary data supports these aims. In this competive renewal, we propose to test the
hypotheses that (1) dietary fat and brain lipids contribute to the elevation of brain iron; and (2) iron interacts
with brain lipids to promote lipid peroxidation, resulting in toxic brain injury (via ferroptosis), neuronal loss, and
ultimately accelerated cognitive and motor decline in aging. We propose to use novel methodologies,
incorporating (oxidized) lipidomics using advanced methodologies (i.e. targeted and oxidized lipidomics and
immune-assisted, tandem Laser Ablation MALDI/ICP-MS) to map iron and lipid-mediated neurodegeneration in
cognitive and motor brain regions. We will expand dietary studies, and leverage a rich resource of clinical and
pathologic data available from Rush Memory and Aging Project. Overall, we propose to collect new data on
brain lipids, increase data on iron and dietary fats to goal of 850 brains. In Aim 1, we will test the hypotheses
that dietary fat intake is associated with brain lipid composition and iron content; that brain lipid composition is
associated with brain iron content; and use advanced technology to map and test their relationship across the
layered cortex. In Aim 2, we propose to detect oxidized lipids and test the hypotheses that lipid peroxidation is
associated with brain iron, Alzheimer’s pathology, and cognitive decline. We also will investigate whether lipid
peroxides mediate cognitive decline associated with iron in AD. In Aim 3 we will determine brain iron and
(oxidized) lipid content in brain motor regions and test the hypothesis that regional brain iron is associated with
lipid composition and with motor function and decline and motor pathology (Lewy body, vascular, AD, etc.) in
older persons. In each aim, we will investigate how relationships differ by APOE ε4, Alzheimer’s pathologic
diagnosis and sex. Overall, these studies have the potential to uncover new mechanisms by which iron, lipids
(diet and brain), and APOE ε4 increase cognitive and motor decline in aging and AD. These studies have the
potential to reveal new and targetable biologic pathways."

 Heparan sulfate (HS) play roles in many important biological events, including cancer metastasis, anti-
coagulation, and Alzheimer’s disease development. HS structures in nature are heterogeneous with a wide range
sulfation patterns and backbone structures. The interactions of HS with their biological partners are known to be
significantly impacted by the fine structures of HS. Thus, for a thorough understanding of the structure-activity
relationships of HS, it is critical that large libraries of HS structures are available. However, synthesis of HS
oligosaccharide libraries remains a tremendous challenge due to the complexity of HS structures. To overcome
this bottleneck, through an innovative industry/academia collaboration, Glycan Therapeutics will develop a HS
like hexasaccharide library with diverse and well-defined molecular structures. The novel hexasaccharide
mimetics will be designed through head-to-tail linkage of HS disaccharides, thus greatly simplifying the overall
synthetic process enabling the preparation of a large number of compounds for library synthesis.
 In aim 1, solution phase based methodologies will be developed to synthesize HS like hexasaccharides
mimicking native HS. Robust linker chemistry will be designed to link the disaccharide modules in a head-to-tail
fashion. In aim 2, methods will be developed for expedient synthesis of the key disaccharide building blocks. To
cover the diverse HS sequences bearing 2-O, 6-O and N-sulfation encountered in nature, 16 disaccharides are
needed. Rather than starting from the corresponding monosaccharides de novo, a new divergent synthetic
strategy will be developed where the 16 disaccharides will be derived from two key advanced disaccharide
building blocks. This process reduces the total number of synthetic steps needed to produce the building blocks
by ~50%. In aim 3, automation chemistry will be developed to enable machine aided synthesis of the HS like
hexasaccharide mimetic library. The structure of each compound (>98% purity) will be confirmed by 1D/2D NMR
and high-resolution mass spectrometry. All mimetics will be functionalized with a linker at the reducing end to
enable facile bioconjugation and microarray production.
 In Phase I studies, two key strategically protected advanced disaccharide intermediates (500 mg each),
and 6 new hexasaccharide mimetics (2 mg each) will be produced. In addition, automated method will be
developed to synthesize two hexasaccharide like compounds (2 mg each). In Phase II, the synthesis will be
scaled up to produce a library of 300 HS like hexasaccharides (2 mg each).
 The extensive HS hexasaccharide mimetics that will be assembled from this project will be the largest
and the most comprehensive HS mimic library available. The commercial availability of these products would
greatly accelerate research on the understanding of the fascinating biological functions of HS, as well as the
development of novel HS-based therapeutics."

In the U.S., chronic respiratory diseases are a leading cause of death and disability. Occupational exposures
substantially contribute to the burden of chronic lung diseases, resulting in >$10 billion in annual medical
expenditures. To address this significant public health burden, there is a pressing need for early identification
and mitigation of workplace risk factors, particularly in underrepresented groups experiencing elevated
exposures to respiratory toxicants. Hairdressers are an understudied, at-risk population for whom respiratory
health is a major concern. Over 700,000 U.S. hairdressers are exposed to chemicals which may impact lung
health. Our pilot data show that hairdressers of color (Black and Latina) have twice the national asthma
prevalence and that, compared to U.S. women, they have elevated exposures to mixtures of chemicals of
concern, including phthalates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Limited animal and in vivo studies
report that the few phthalates and VOCs studied may affect epithelial cells leading to airway remodeling, have
immunomodulatory and adjuvant properties, and may be linked to oxidative stress and inflammatory
responses, mechanisms underlying respiratory diseases. Still, no studies to date have conducted robust
exposure characterization of these chemicals and assessed their role on the respiratory health of U.S.
hairdressers, despite prevalent respiratory health concerns. The overarching goal of the Measurement of
Exposures, Lung hEalth, and functioN in hAirdressers: The MELENA Study is to comprehensively assess
personal and workplace behaviors and workplace exposures to phthalates and VOCs and elucidate their role
on lung health. We will use robust exposure characterization approaches to identify opportunities for actionable
interventions to mitigate occupational exposures and associated respiratory health risks. To this end, we will
leverage our strong community partnerships and multidisciplinary team of experts to execute the following aims
in a racially diverse cohort of hairdressers: (1) assess exposures to phthalates and VOCs and identify
exposure risk drivers; (2) determine if exposure to phthalates and VOCs is associated with increased upper
airway and systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory markers; and (3) determine if phthalates and VOCs are
associated with worse lung function and respiratory symptoms. This will be the first study to comprehensively
characterize exposures to phthalates and VOCs (individually and as mixtures using novel mixtures methods)
and associated lung health risks among U.S. hairdressers. While work is a social determinant of health that
can drive health inequities, it is often overlooked as an avenue for public health interventions. Thus, identifying
modifiable workplace contributors in this population will provide key foundational evidence for disease
prevention and control. Findings will have direct public health impact by informing effective interventions and
federal policies to address exposures and protect vulnerable populations."

The Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins governs embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Deregulated
Wnt signaling has been implicated in human diseases including birth defects, cancer, and degenerative
disorders. Investigation of the mechanism of Wnt signaling has critical significance for developmental and
cancer biology and human health, and will uncover new avenues for disease treatment. Over the last two
decades, research in my lab has elucidated many key aspects of the Wnt pathway, including the Wnt receptor
complex and various molecules and mechanisms that regulate the complex assembly and downstream
signaling, and the mechanism by which the Wnt pathway regulates embryonic patterning and cell polarity in
Xenopus embryos.
In this application I plan to address fundamental questions on the mechanism of Wnt signaling and its role in
vertebrate early embryogenesis by employing genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening, proteomic and
transcriptomic analyses in combination with classical biochemical and embryological approaches.
I believe that experiments outlined in this application will significantly enhance our understanding of Wnt
signaling and early vertebrate embryogenesis, and have broad impact to developmental and cancer/disease
biology."

Molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis induction throughout germline development and aging
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Ferroptotic cell death
is a component of human diseases, such as neurodegeneration, lung, and kidney disease. Promotion of
ferroptosis may be a useful therapeutic to target cancerous tumors. Many unanswered questions surround this
relatively newly discovered form of cell death, including the nature of lipid-mediator instigators of ferroptosis,
how dietary components affect ferroptosis, and how metabolic processes involving cellular organelles such as
mitochondria, ER, and cellular vesicles influence ferroptosis sensitivity. Furthermore, there is a dearth of
studies examining whether ferroptosis affects germ cells and influences reproduction. We have developed a
highly novel ferroptosis model using the small roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Our studies center on the
induction of ferroptosis by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, which we have shown to specifically induce cell
death in germ cells in young C. elegans. The powerful genetic tools in this model have allowed us to make
rapid progress in the identification of modulators of diet-induced ferroptosis, especially in relation to lipid
metabolism pathways, iron, and antioxidant protection. Importantly, our discoveries have been confirmed in
mammalian models, including the important finding that ferroptotic cell death can be induced in cancer cell
lines by addition of the polyunsaturated fatty acid dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). We propose a multifaceted
approach to discover and characterize molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis induction using genetic, dietary,
and biochemical approaches. Furthermore, we will expand our studies of ferroptosis in germ cells to older
worms to determine the role of ferroptosis in reproductive aging. Our experience and expertise, together with
the flexible MIRA mechanism to pursue new research opportunities as they arise, will propel sustained
progress. These studies will provide insights into the complex regulation of ferroptosis throughout development
in a multicellular, living animal. Our findings may also contribute to novel cancer treatments or provide
potential therapeutic targets for treatments of diseases promoted by ferroptosis."

Children with advanced neuroblastoma (NBL) have poor outcomes despite aggressive, multimodal therapy and
new therapeutic approaches are needed. Recent studies have demonstrated that targeted 131I-MIBG
radiopharmaceutical therapy combining modulators of somatic epigenetic programs (vorinostat) and GD2-
targeted immunotherapy (dinutuximab) show substantial therapeutic promise. Although 131I-MIBG is one of the
most effective therapies for advanced NBL, not all patients will respond to this therapy and predictive
biomarkers of treatment response and mechanisms of resistance have not been identified. Our preliminary
work in NBL show that minimally invasive liquid biopsy strategies for the detection of circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and cell-free GD2 levels can be successfully employed in longitudinal
samples without reliance on surgical procedures in this vulnerable pediatric population. In this proposal, we will
apply these technologies to samples collected from a randomized, phase 2 trial designed to identify the optimal
agents for combination with 131I-MIBG in relapsed/refractory NBL (NANT 2021-02 [N21-02]) launching soon.
Patients are randomized to either (A) vorinostat + 131I-MIBG; (B) dinutuximab + 131I-MIBG; or (C) vorinostat +
dinutuximab + 131I-MIBG. Our overall hypothesis is that circulating biomarker levels will be associated with
treatment response for each combination being tested in this trial. We further hypothesize that selection for
mutations, changes in chromatin signatures, and downregulation of antigen expression will be associated with
disease progression. In Aim 1, we will profile serial plasma samples to detect and quantify ctDNA levels and
measure the association between ctDNA levels and response to therapy on each arm of N21-02. Furthermore,
we will identify mutations associated with the development of treatment resistance through deep sequencing of
ctDNA samples. In Aim 2, we will validate our existing chromatin accessibility and gene expression signatures
associated with vorinostat treatment in preclinical models and in vorinostat-treated patient samples. We will
then leverage serial liquid biopsy samples from patients enrolled on N21-02 treated with and without vorinostat
to detect induction of vorinostat signatures to determine whether these signatures are associated with
responses to vorinostat-containing therapies. Finally, in Aim 3, we will longitudinally measure soluble GD2
levels and surface expression levels on CTCs in samples collected from patients on dinutuximab-containing
treatment arms and compare GD2 levels to patients not receiving dinutuximab therapy. We will test the
association of soluble GD2 levels and response to GD2-directed therapy and determine whether changes in
GD2 expression on CTCs are associated with the development of disease progression on therapy. At the end
of this award, we expect to identify biomarkers of response and mechanisms of treatment resistance in
patients with relapsed NBL. These findings will lead to optimized treatment selection and new candidate
therapies to prevent the emergence of resistant disease in patients with NBL."

Aggressive tumors that are metastatic and intrinsically resistant to conventional therapies represent a critical
issue mediating the morbidity and mortality of most, if not all tumors, including breast cancer. It is postulated
that targeting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the ensuing formation of cancer stem cells
(CSCs) is likely to represent a means of reducing the rate at which primary breast cancers spawn metastatic
derivatives. In the context of cancer, cells having undergone an EMT have enhanced tumor-initiating ability,
are capable of generating mammospheres, exhibit cell-surface markers and gene expression profiles similar
to both normal mammary (MaSC) and breast cancer (BCSC) stem cells and become more resistant to
chemotherapeutics. We have recently demonstrated a role for TGFβ-induced EMT in the formation of tumor
initiating cells (TICs), through a signaling pathway involving the RNA binding protein hnRNP E1 (E1). Herein,
our data demonstrates that this TGFβ/E1/ signaling pathway leads to the induction of an embryonic lncRNA
known as Platr18 (pluripotent associated transcript 18). We show that this lncRNA is not expressed in normal
epithelium or other adult somatic tissues but is highly induced by the TGFβ/E1 axis and in cells having
undergone an EMT or during cancer progression. The scientific premise of the proposal is that the TGFβ-
mediated EMT program induces the generation of TICs and tumor progression through TGFβ/E1 signaling and
reactivation of silenced Platr18. Its goals are to delineate the molecular mechanism(s) of Platr18 function and
determine its role in modulating T-cell mediated immunity through VSIG-3 & tumor innervation through
Sema4F."
10936528,"Pathological tau protein accumulates in neuronal lesions and constitutes one of the defining
diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathy disorders. Tau neuropathology correlates
with severity of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease. However, tau related dysfunction and aggregation drives
neurodegenerative changes by an incompletely understood molecular mechanism. Previous work has
demonstrated that RNA binding proteins impact tau function and aggregation in model systems and disease
states. In quantitative studies, we have shown that tau binds RNA with high affinity but low sequence specificity.
Tau RNA complexes (TRCs) form high molecular weight oligomeric tau species that may be on pathway to
formation of mature fibrillar aggregates. We have produced a TRC recognizing monoclonal antibody (TRC35)
that detects a disease relevant pathological tau conformation. We hypothesize that RNA and microtubules (MTs)
compete for tau binding with TRC formation driving neuropathological tau accumulation, fibril deposition, and
neurodegeneration while MT binding promotes neuronal homeostasis. We propose 3 specific aims to determine
the impact of tau RNA binding activity on disease pathogenesis. We will 1) dissect the molecular features of
tau RNA binding activity and interplay with tau microtubule binding activity; 2) map the abundance,
distribution, and composition of TRC35+ lesions in tauopathy disorders; and 3) measure the impact of
tau RNA complex formation on neurodegeneration. Completion of the proposed project will impact the field
by integrating tau RNA binding functions with known tau roles in MT stabilization. We will also gain significant
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in disease relevant pathological tau aggregation and
deposition in tauopathy disorders. We will further measure the contribution of tau/RNA complexes to the
neurodegeneration observed in tauopathies."

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common chronic condition that affects more than 1 billion people worldwide.
Currently, presence of OSA and its severity is assessed using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) that measures
the frequency/rate of respiratory events. AHI has demonstrable limitations including lack predictive accuracy and
poor relationship to outcomes. Task forces across the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research
Society and others internationally have made an urgent plea to move the diagnosis and management of sleep
apnea beyond the AHI. In response to this, our group has recently developed a physiology guided AI/ML
approach that utilizes the known OSA pathophysiology across ventilatory, hypoxic, and arousal burdens and
combines them into probability scores that provide risk of short- and long-term adverse outcomes of OSA. We
use fully automate, reliable, and interpretable measures for ventilatory, hypoxic, and arousal burden towards our
pursuit of explainable AI. Our preliminary data from 10,952 subjects across three epidemiological cohorts
suggests that the machine-learned sleep apnea probability of sleepiness (SAPs), which combines
ventilatory/hypoxic/arousal burdens, classifies sleepiness with accuracy of 87%. Further, using the same
approach but with different set of weights that were trained to predict cardiovascular (CVD) and all-cause
mortality, the sleep apnea probability of CVD (SAPcv) predicted CVD and all-cause mortality across 4,784
subjects with an accuracy of 81% and 88% respectively. To be translatable into clinical practice, validation of
AI/ML approaches in a sleep clinic population is needed and is the core objective of our proposal. In Aim 1 we
will validate SAPs and SAPcv as probability scores for risk of short- and long-term outcomes across a sleep
clinical population comprising data from a diverse set of subjects (N=6,393) seen at the Mount Sinai Health
System from the Greater New York Area. In Aim 2, we will assess real-world performance of SAPs across
subjects (N=700) see at Mount Sinai, as a tool in the decision-making pipeline to predict improvements in
sleepiness with 3 months of treatment using any modality (e.g., CPAP, oral, positional etc.). Finally, in Aim 3, we
will use causal random forests to assess conditional average treatment effects, thereby identifying subgroup of
subjects who are likely to benefit from treatment with respect to CVD outcomes. Our proposal will offer crucial
evidence needed to translate metrics that go beyond AHI in assessing severity of OSA into clinical practice and
are thus poised to shift the paradigm in clinical management of OSA."

Hemizygous microdeletions encompassing TBX1 cause 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), the most
common deletion syndrome in humans. Among a broad spectrum of clinical features that often include
craniofacial dysmorphia, congenital heart defects (CHDs) of the outflow tract (OFT), and aortic arch, which is
derived from embryonic vessels termed pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), are the main causes of mortality
during childhood. Importantly, specific craniofacial muscles, the OFT, and PAAs all derive from the pharyngeal
apparatus, a transient series of arches and pouches that form by segmentation on the lateral surface of the
head. Because segmentation is severely compromised in Tbx1-deficient animals, their craniofacial and
cardiovascular defects were considered secondary. Using zebrafish as a model, my laboratory reported that
tbx1 mutant embryos recapitulate several aspects of 22q11.2DS, including craniofacial muscle, OFT, and PAA
deficiencies. We also demonstrated that these end structures descend from nkx2.5+ progenitors initially
specified in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) before becoming sequestered in the cores of the
pharyngeal arches. Unexpectedly, we discovered that tbx1 mutants fail to specify the nkx2.5+ pharyngeal
lineage in the ALPM that gives rise to the missing derivatives. Because this phenotype precedes pharyngeal
segmentation, defects in progenitor specification are likely causal for the deficiencies observed in tbx1
mutants. The aberrant fates of these progenitors, which maintain hand2 and gata5 expression in the ALPM,
are unknown. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs specification of the pharyngeal
lineage in the ALPM have not been elucidated in any model system. Here, we have the unique opportunity to
uncover the molecular mechanisms by which Tbx1 directs specification of the pharyngeal progenitor cell
lineage because we have defined the relevant developmental time window for analysis, identified markers of
the preserved (gata5+) and missing (nkx2.5+) progenitor populations, implemented single-cell RNA and ATAC
sequencing that allows for unprecedented resolution of changes in cellular populations and chromatin
accessibility, and generated state-of-the-art genetic tools for tracking the aberrant fates of tbx1-expressing
cells in tbx1 mutants and for identifying Tbx1 target loci that confer the pharyngeal progenitor cell fate. Overall,
we propose to use the attributes of the zebrafish system, including its genetic tractability, unmatched
embryonic accessibility, and imaging capabilities, to reveal new mechanistic insights that will provide the most
comprehensive view of how Tbx1 is necessary and potentially sufficient for instructing the pharyngeal
progenitor cell lineage during vertebrate development."

Stillbirths and neonatal deaths are two adverse birth outcomes of critical global health relevance. In 2021, an
estimated 1.9 million babies were stillborn, and 2.3 million liveborn babies died before reaching 28 days of age.
India stands out globally as the country having the largest number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths
(respectively 290,000 and 440,000 in 2021). These large numbers not only reflect the size of India’s
population but also its high levels of stillbirth and neonatal mortality. Moreover, not only are India’s neonatal
mortality rates high relative to other countries, but they are high relative to India’s own levels of postneonatal
mortality. This indicates the existence in India of a distorted age pattern of mortality at early ages with excess
mortality at neonatal ages, impeding the country’s ability to meet Sustainable Development Goals targets. In
spite of the significance of these patterns, measurement and understanding of stillbirth rates and neonatal
mortality in India are hindered by major gaps in data availability and quality. Undercount of stillbirths and
neonatal deaths as well as misclassification of neonatal deaths vs. stillbirths in existing, mostly retrospective
sources remain major concerns. Issues with availability and quality of information on small for gestational age,
preterm and low birthweight – three major risk factors that can play a large role in both levels and age patterns
of early-age mortality – are additional gaps that further impede proper monitoring of India’s patterns of
mortality during the late fetal and neonatal periods. The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of
why India stands out globally in terms of both its levels and age patterns of mortality during the late fetal and
neonatal periods by collecting new prospective data in 4 surveillance sites located in different regions of India,
covering a variety of contexts. While the focus of this project is on India due to the outsize role it plays in global
rates of stillbirth and neonatal mortality, results will have methodological and substantive implications for
other low-income countries, including other South Asian countries and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which,
like India, are characterized by a high burden of stillbirths and neonatal mortality as well as large data gaps in
their stillbirth and neonatal mortality information."

research spanning basic and translational science to clinical studies, and cancer etiology to cancer control. DSC
members work with investigators on the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of cancer research, and play a
key role in clinical trials protocol review and study monitoring in the NCCC. As such, the DSC serves as a key
foundational element in the Data Science component of the Strategic Plan, enabling infrastructure and data
platforms for all NCCC Research Programs. NCCC recruited Ming Li PhD as DSC Director and David Birtwell
MSE as Co-Director with oversight of DSC by NCCC Administration. A major development in this grant period,
DSC now expands beyond traditional biostatistics services to include clinical research informatics services to
integrate data from electronic health records to -omics platforms for analysis. DSC applies advanced and novel
statistical methods to these data, including artificial intelligence/machine learning for discovery of underlying risk
factors, prediction of population level risk, and clinical decision algorithms and tools. During the current grant
period (2015-2020), 88 NCCC members representing all five programs utilized the DSC, resulting directly in 278
publications and 13 funded cancer-related P and U grants. The anticipated annual budget of DSC in the first
year of the next grant cycle is $1,548,658, yet the CCSG request is $379,255. Accordingly, DSC leverages
extensive institutional and recharge support and seeks only 24% from CCSG funds."
10774222,"Despite great advances in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, and major advances in clinical care, major
health challenges remain that negatively impact public health. Addressing these challenges requires that the
biomedical field draw from the broadest talent pool available. Yet, analysis of the trends in the biomedical
sciences workforce and trainee pool consistently demonstrate that specific racial and ethnic groups remain
underrepresented in this arena relative to their representation within the population of the United States.
Therefore, programs that address the discrepancy in participation rates between different racial, ethnic, gender
and/or socioeconomic groups, and promote the engagement of the maximum number of talented individuals
are needed.
In this application, we propose the implementation of a research training program, under the umbrella of the
Initiative to Maximize Student Development (IMSD), to alleviate this discrepancy at our institution, the
University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. The mission of the proposed IMSD
is to facilitate the excellence of a cadre of talented young scientists from traditionally underrepresented
backgrounds. The program will achieve its mission through the development and deployment of: a series of
academic and research activities that increase the excellence of participating students as biomedical scientists;
professional development activities that prepare participants for success in a range of biomedical sciences-
related careers; and the implementation of training workshops that shift trainee self-perception and mentor
training capacity. These activities are expected to produce rigorously trained, successful young PhD scientists
who will persist in biomedical sciences-related careers. The program will measure the success of its activities
through the following metrics:
 1) Increased student retention and completion rates. We expect to observe >90% retention through
 the successful completion of the Qualifying Examination at the end of year 2, and >85% successful
 completion of the PhD. These retention and completion rates will match or exceed the rates for the
 broader population of PhD trainees in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) at UMMS.
 2) Decreased time to degree completion. The current average time to completion for PhD trainees in
 the GSBS is 6.4 years. We expect the time to degree completion for IMSD trainees to be shorter than
 for the average GSBS student. During the initial reporting period, we anticipate that the average time to
 degree will be 6.2 years, with the goal of achieving an average time to completion of < 6 years.
 3) Increased student publications. We expect that IMSD participants will, on average, publish 4 papers
 during graduate study, including 2 as first author. These metrics are in line with the output of the
 broader GSBS population.
 4) Successful attainment of individual fellowships. We anticipate that 50% of IMSD program
 participants will successfully compete for individual fellowships from the NIH or private funding
agencies.
 5) Attainment of desired post-graduate opportunities. We expect that IMSD participants will be top
 candidates in their chosen career paths. We further expect that 100% of IMSD participants will
 transition from PhD training to their preferred career path.
 6) Increased sense of belonging at UMMS and self-identity as scientists. Through activities that
 increase the capacity of research mentors and other faculty to effectively mentor a diverse student
 population, as well as activities that increase students’ self-identity as scientists, IMSD trainees will
 develop increased sense of belonging at UMMS and envision themselves as important contributors to
 the scientific enterprise at UMMS and in their future careers.
The successful implementation of the program will increase the number of students from underrepresented
backgrounds earning PhDs at UMMS, enhance the persistence of these newly minted PhDs in biomedical
careers, and enhance the research excellence at UMMS by positively shifting the research training
environment."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death; lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most
frequent type. The pathogenesis of LUAD is poorly understood. We recently discovered that sodium-glucose
transporter 2 (SGLT2) is a previously unrecognized system of metabolic supply specifically active in early-
stage LUAD and required for lung carcinogenesis. SGLT2 inhibition prolongs survival, delays cancer
development, and slows tumor growth in genetically engineered murine models (GEMMs) and in patient-
derived xenografts (PDXs) of LUAD. Pre-malignant lesions and early-stage LUADs express SGLT2 but not the
well-known GLUT1 transporter, whereas more advanced tumors display heterogeneous expression of SGLT2
in low-grade and GLUT1 in high-grade areas of the same tumor. Why do tumors need to switch from SGLT2 to
GLUT1 as they progress? Our data suggest that this switch is associated with a reprogramming of glucose
metabolism: SGLT2+ tumors use oxidative glucose metabolism, GLUT1+ tumors use glycolysis. Glucose
uptake can be studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG),
transported by GLUTs and not SGLTs, and methyl 4-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (Me4FDG), specific for SGLTs.
 We will investigate the heterogeneity of glucose transport in LUAD, to understand the biological
significance and the mechanisms that regulate the expression of SGLT2 and GLUT1. In Aim 1, we will
characterize glucose metabolism in Me4FDG+ versus FDG+ tumors in GEMMs and in PDXs by PET imaging,
respirometry, metabolomics, metabolic tracing, histology, and transcriptomics, with or without CRISPR
knockout or overexpression of SGLT2 and GLUT1. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of GSK3 kinase, which
we identified as an SGLT2 regulator, in the regulation of metabolic/differentiation programs associated with the
switch from SGLT2 to GLUT1. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of hypoxia in the switch from SGLT2 to
GLUT1 expression as LUAD progresses from well- to poorly differentiated, including correlation between FDG
or Me4FDG uptake with markers of hypoxia (F-MISO, pimonidazole), and evaluation of the effect of hypoxia-
inducible factors knockout on SGLT- and GLUT-dependent uptake.
 The goal of the proposed research is the elucidation of a novel mechanism of metabolic reprogramming
in cancer: switching between two different glucose transporters, cancer cells can redirect the metabolic fate of
glucose towards different pathways; this observation has important implications as interfering with the Warburg
effect or with glucose transport has been proposed as a novel therapy for cancer; the ability of cancer cells to
change their metabolism by switching glucose transporters is a potentially targetable mechanism of resistance,
as there are specific inhibitors of both SGLT2 and GLUT. Moreover, the availability of PET tracers that can
selectively measure SGLT or GLUT activity in vivo (Me4FDG and FDG, respectively) is a promising tool for
characterizing the metabolic phenotype of cancers in vivo, in order to predict their response to treatments."

10774225,"Background: Despite effective HIV prevention and treatment, the global HIV epidemic continues to grow.
Current programs to engage populations at high HIV risk have had limited impact, in part because they do not
reach those at highest risk. To reduce the global burden of HIV, new, evidence-based, far-reaching strategies
are needed to engage individuals at risk in HIV prevention and treatment. In the U.S. and globally, people are
increasingly using mobile/social technologies (SMT) (e.g. dating apps, WhatsApp, Facebook) to socialize and
meet partners. While this shift in how individuals socialize has disrupted traditional face-to-face outreach, SMT
provides an unprecedented opportunity to engage historically hard-to-reach groups, such as men who have
sex with men (MSM), for HIV prevention and treatment. Th goal of this study is to test whether a SMT-based
behavioral intervention that includes a digital coupon for free HIV testing (CHALO! 2.0) enhances HIV testing
and linkage-to-care among a population that continues to experience high rates of HIV infection in India.
 The scientific premise of this proposal is that a community-developed, theory-based intervention will
engage MSM at high risk of HIV who are reached online, and that the intervention will increase HIV knowledge
and enhance motivation and behavioral skills to obtain HIV testing and get linked to HIV prevention (if HIV-
uninfected) or HIV treatment (if HIV-infected). The rationale for this research study is that determining efficacy
of a rapidly scalable SMT-based behavioral intervention is needed before widespread dissemination. The
significance of this research question is that even a modestly effective SMT-based HIV prevention intervention
may efficiently reach many individuals at high risk of HIV and lead to increased HIV status awareness, better
linkage-to-care, and fewer new HIV infections.
 Methods: In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, we will determine whether CHALO! 2.0 results in
increased HIV testing and linkage-to-care (prevention or treatment) among sexually active MSM who are
unaware of their HIV status (never tested or tested >6 months ago) and are recruited online. We will conduct a
12-week, three arm randomized trial comparing CHALO! 2.0 to two control conditions: an attention-matched
SMT-based control (also including a digital coupon for free HIV testing), and a digital coupon only control.
 Potential Impact: While global health agencies have called for online interventions to engage populations at
high HIV risk who are not being reached, few effective models exist and none exist in India, which is home to
one of the world’s largest MSM HIV epidemics. This study will address this gap by testing a scalable and
replicable online model to engage individuals at high HIV risk and link them to HIV testing and prevention or
treatment. This proposal is responsive to NIH PA-18-278: Innovations in HIV Testing…to Optimize HIV Care
Continuum Outcomes, and addresses multiple high priority research areas of NIH’s Office of AIDS Research.
The proposed model, if found effective, may also accelerate achieving UNAIDS 90-90-90 care targets."
10774226,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dravet syndrome (DS), a catastrophic childhood epilepsy, is associated with severe intellectual disability,
impaired social development, persistent drug-resistant seizures and a high risk of sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy. Our recent investigation of zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (scn1a)
mutation (e.g., a gene mutation identified in ~80% of DS patients) focused on drug discovery and
development, metabolic dysfunction and behavioral comorbidities. Using a high-throughput phenotype-based
screening strategy and medicinal chemistry, we screened nearly 3000 drugs, successfully identified a
serotonin (5HT) receptor mechanism underlying anti-seizure activity of clemizole and developed three novel
clemizole analogs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology we generated new zebrafish mutant lines
for chd2, gabrb3, pcdh19 and stxbp1 (e.g., de novo mutations seen in ~20% of DS patients). Interestingly,
stxbp1 and gabrb3 mutants exhibit epileptic phenotypes. We also designed and manufactured a microfluidic,
multi-channel electrode-integrated platform for long-term non-invasive electrophysiology on larval zebrafish
(Hong et al. 2016) and developed a calcium imaging-analysis pipeline for studying seizure macro- and micro-
networks in vivo (Liu and Baraban 2019). The proposed work will leverage these unique tools. Three specific
aims are proposed: (i) to resolve neural networks responsible for seizures in larval DS zebrafish, (ii) to perform
high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and (iii) to further evaluate clemizole and related anti-seizure
compounds. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking, in vivo zebrafish electrophysiology,
pharmacology, and fast calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive indicators.
Our results promise to simultaneously advance our long-term goals (i) to better understand the
pathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and (ii) identify promising new treatment options for these intractable
conditions."
10771501,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 7.5 million American women are unable to become pregnant or carry a baby to term (impaired
fecundity). The ovary is considered a critical target organ in infertility cases based on the large number of
women seeking infertility treatment who are unable to release a viable egg from their ovaries. Folliculogenesis
is the process through which ovarian follicles, the functional units of the ovary, develop into a form capable of
sustaining hormone production and ovulating a healthy egg for fertilization. Any environmental exposure that
causes damage to the ovarian follicle has the potential to impair fecundity in women. Most of what is known
about toxicity to ovarian follicles has been uncovered in laboratory rodents, but there is little available data on
toxicant exposure and related mechanistic toxicology studies in the nonhuman primate, the closest laboratory
animal model to humans. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop alternative approaches and tools that
synergize the accessibility and versatility of laboratory rodents with the physiological relevance of the
nonhuman primate to deliver high quality ovarian follicle toxicity data. To meet this need, this proposal will
support the formation of a virtual research consortium with expertise in mouse and nonhuman primate ovarian
biology, toxicology and computational modeling. The proposed consortium will generate lab-based data on the
physiological and toxicant-induced behavior of ovarian follicles in both species, using phthalate as a model
toxicant, to create computational models capable of effectively predicting ovarian follicle responses to chemical
insults in nonhuman primates. The experimental measures captured in the in vitro and in vivo model will be
specifically chosen to align with the needs of the modelers. To achieve this goal, the proposed consortium will
complete three specific aims. Specifically, the ovarian biology/toxicology team will quantify the physiological
and toxicant-induced behavior of computationally useful markers of in vivo and in vitro folliculogenesis in mice
(Aim 1) and nonhuman primates (Aim 2), while the computational modeling team will construct in silico models
that match the physiological behavior of folliculogenesis in each species and predict follicular responses to
phthalate insults in both species. Our virtual consortium includes researchers from five institutions and will
create a transdisciplinary group that includes both experimental and computational expertise. The tight
coupling of these two domains will provide the needed communication pathways to develop translational
models for IVIVE as well as cross-species extrapolations in reproductive toxicology."

Pancreatic beta cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold the potential to
dramatically change the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). To realize the therapeutic application of these
cells, however, we need to develop a robust and rapid means for generating beta cells. Here, the investigators
propose a novel paradigm for direct programming of hiPSC into beta cells via CRISPR activation of
transcription factors (TFs). These CRISPR activation effectors will be delivered into hiPSCs using modRNAs,
avoiding genomic integrations by previous viral vector approach. Furthermore, the investigators will also use
recent advances in gene editing to generate universal donor hiPSC clones, which will be used for beta cell
programming. These universal donor beta cells can be used for allogeneic transplantation without immune
rejections.
First, the investigators will investigate optimal msgRNAs for activation of pancreatic TFs in hiPSCs. Next, they
will use a multiplexed msgRNA expression system to express all msgRNAs to activate numerous msgRNAs
coupled with the dCas9 activator modRNA to study beta cell programming. In Aim 3, the investigators will
generate immune-privileged beta cells via programming of universal donor hiPSCs. Universal donor hiPSCs
will be generated by removing B2M to inhibit T cell-mediated rejection, and by overexpression of HLA-E trimer
to avoid the natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis of transplanted cells. The investigators will then use in vitro
and in vivo assays to characterize programmed beta cells. For in vitro experiments, the investigator will
perform glucose stimulated insulin secretion assay. For in vivo assays, the investigator will use the NRG Akita
mice to test whether programmed beta cells can reverse diabetes in vivo. The investigator will also use
humanized NSG mice to study whether programmed beta cells from universal donor hiPSCs exhibit immune
evasive properties as compared to cells generated from normal hiPSCs."

 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents the sixth most common cancer
worldwide. The Global Cancer Observatory predicts a 30% increase in annual incidence by 2030 with
approximately 1.08 million new cases/year. Radiation therapy (RT) plays an integral role in treating HNSCC;
however, head and neck RT is associated with significant toxicity in the oral mucosa. This toxicity, termed
radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM), can lead to opioid use, reduced oral intake/poor nutritional status, and
the need for treatment breaks, all of which are correlated with worse outcomes for patients with HNSCC. As
current treatment options for RIOM are limited, there is an unmet need to develop novel radioprotectors that
will widen the therapeutic window of head and neck RT. Our long-term goal aims to develop novel therapeutic
strategies that will prevent or reduce RIOM without sacrificing tumor control. The overall objective of this
application is to define the role of p53 in regulating RIOM. The p53 gene is mutated in >80% of human
papillomavirus negative HNSCC, yet it remains wild type in adjacent normal tissues. The p53 protein plays a
critical role in regulating various cellular responses to stress such as cell death, cell survival, metabolic
adaptation, and maintenance of genomic integrity. In normal oral epithelium, RT markedly increases the level
of p53 protein as well as its transcriptional target and negative regulator Mdm2. However, how p53 affects
damage and recovery of the oral epithelium following irradiation remains poorly understood. Based on our
preliminary data generated from p53 knockout mice, we hypothesize that the response of p53 to acute DNA
damage plays a crucial role in promoting the regeneration of oral epithelium following severe radiation injury.
Therefore, treatment with Mdm2 inhibitors that enhance p53-dependent signaling specifically in cells harboring
a functional p53 protein before and during RT will ameliorate acute injury of p53 wild-type oral epithelium
without decreasing the therapeutic response of p53 mutant HNSCC. We will test this hypothesis through both
loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to modulate the response of p53 to radiation using genetically
engineered mouse models and small molecule Mdm2 inhibitors. The impact of Mdm2 inhibition on RIOM will
be evaluated in normal and tumor-bearing mice. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide
mechanistic insights into the crucial role of p53 in promoting the regeneration of oral epithelium following acute
radiation injury. Our findings will provide a proof-of-concept to support clinical development of Mdm2 inhibitors
as radioprotectors for RIOM to widen the therapeutic window of RT for treating p53 mutant HNSCC."
10756433,"Diseases of the nervous system represent an existing and growing emotional and economic burden to society. Neuroscientific research is critical to the discovery of new therapies and treatments for these disorders. With this goal in mind, it is imperative that we train research scientists who represent US society, including ethnic minorities, people from economically disadvantaged groups and people with disabilities. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technology emerges in part from the fact that underrepresented minority students either fail to enter or leave the pathway that starts with a STEM college education and continues with graduate school in science-related fields. The University of Washington Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Education Experiences (UW-ENDURE) program will capitalize on the NIH Blueprint Program to help community college students in the Puget Sound region transition into graduate research careers by exposing them to summer and academic-year mentored research experiences in the field of neuroscience at the University of Washington. Our first Specific Aim will be to recruit each year 8 undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds to participate in academic-year and summer research as well as training in the field of neuroscience. Our second Specific Aim to assure that each recruited student is incorporated into the research program of a neuroscience laboratory within the UW, and is part of a comprehensive set of educational and mentoring opportunities including summer workshops and academic-year courses, and a one-on-one mentoring plan that starts during their stage at UW-ENDURE and continues for year after their completion of the Program. Finally, our third Specific Aim is to thoroughly evaluate UW-ENDURE’s immediate impact on students’ quantitative skills and understanding of neuroscience principles, and on the students’ success in applying to and entering competitive STEM graduate careers. The Puget Sound region represents an ideal combination of underrepresented minorities in STEM careers within community colleges and a top neuroscience research institution like the UW. UW-ENDURE will capitalize on this scenario to help underrepresented minorities transition into and remain in the fascinating world of neuroscience research."
10756498,"Project Summary
Plasma medicine is a promising, relatively new field that encompasses the discovery and development of
biomedical applications for cold plasma (a.k.a. non-thermal, non-equilibrium, or atmospheric plasma). Cold
plasma is generated in several forms by using a strong electromagnetic field to ionize gas at atmospheric
pressure and ambient temperature. When cold plasma is applied to living cells or tissues, the effects can range
from subtle changes in cellular metabolism and function to programmed or necrotic cell death, dependent on
plasma properties (or amount of plasma). In therapeutic strategies involving plasma, the dose delivered is an
important determinant of a successful treatment. A sub-optimal plasma dose may be ineffective, while a plasma
dose in excess of that required to achieve the desired outcome may cause adverse side effects. However, no
real-time measure of an effective plasma dose exists. The determination and controlled delivery of a plasma
dose, at present, relies on empirical measures of outcome that assess secondary or tertiary effects of plasma
hours to days after the exposure. There is a critical need for regulation of cold plasma delivery that uses
concurrent measurement of primary plasma effectors (markers) that correlate with biological and clinical
outcomes (endpoints) necessary to define plasma dose. The objective of this grant is to develop endpoint
detection strategies for plasma-based therapies, using plasma-facilitated wound repair as the endpoint and
oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as the primary detectable marker. The hypothesis is that there is a link
between the absolute ORP and cellular responses, allowing us to develop an ORP sensor-based method that
monitors the plasma dose and feeds this information in a closed-loop control system. The proposed research is
innovative because it will use ORP detection as the basis for a sensor-controlled, closed-loop feedback control
system that will regulate plasma delivery as determined by the endpoint outcome. Collaborative investigational
and development efforts will combine experience in models of in vivo wound healing (Rutgers University), in vitro
models of epithelial wound repair, and plasma biology (Drexel University) with expertise in device engineering
and plasma chemistry (North Carolina State University). The proposed research is framed around the following
specific aims: (1) Establish correlations between CAP dose ranges, measurable biological parameters and
wound healing outcomes using in vivo and in vitro models of wound healing; (2) correlate sensor outputs with
cellular responses in the in vitro scratch assay; (3) develop a closed-loop control system for regulated plasma
delivery; and (4) challenge and optimize the controller in vitro and in vivo. Our focus on endpoint detection and
feedback control for wound healing will facilitate developmental efforts for this particular therapeutic use of
plasma, but will also provide a solid foundation for applying endpoint detection to other translational applications
of cold plasma, including therapies for dermatological conditions, cancer, and infections by viral and bacterial
pathogens."
10756500,"Project Summary
In this grant we propose three aims focused on exploring the predictions of these gene regulatory
networks (GRN) by examining how critical transcription factors influence parvalbumin (PV) and
somatostatin (SST) cortical interneurons (cINs) at early and late points in development (1a), as
well as explore the role of candidate disease genes that affect these populations (1b). In the next
two aims we then focus upon SST cINs as they settle within particular cortex laminae to explore
how extrinsic signals contribute to their diversity (2a,b) how mutations in the laminar specific
genes Fezf2 and Tbr1 affect SST cIN lamination, as well as using these methods in the context
of our gene regulatory networks (GRN) strategy to identify molecules that affects these
events(3a,b). This will allow us to test our hypothesis that cINs emerges from a combination of a
genetic program initiated upon them becoming postmitotic combined with non-autonomous
signals from pyramidal neurons at their settling position within cortical laminae.
 A chief goal of my laboratory is to determine how changes in gene regulation create
cortical interneuron diversity and how perturbations in these programs result in brain disease.
By joining efforts with the Bonneau laboratory, whose expertise is in computational biology, we
propose to both create and test GRNs for parvalbumin and somatostatin cortical interneurons
across development. Combining this with the Fishell laboratory’s expertise in development,
genetics and circuit formation, we will explore in aims 2 and 3 the mechanisms by which non-
autonomous cues from pyramidal neurons shape developmental programs in SST cINs, as well
as their synaptic connectivity.
 Together, this grant represents a broad scale effort to both develop and test the
robustness of GRNs by applying them to understanding gene regulation in developing cortical
interneurons, as well as to determine the extrinsic environmental signals from pyramidal cells
that shape both the development and connectivity of developing interneurons. From our
preliminary data it is evident that canonical cortical circuits are much more precise and specific
to particular subtypes. By defining their relationships, as well as the molecular mechanisms that
dictate their synaptic specificity, this work will greatly increase both our understanding of cINs,
as well as the microcircuits they contribute to. This in turn will greatly extend our understanding
of how discrete cIN and pyramidal neurons interact in the obligate lock and key mechanisms
that allow their assembly."
10756565,"Project Summary
Skin stem cells are heavily influenced by signals from their niches including different fibroblasts populations.
While our ability to isolate and molecularly profile diverse cell types has improved drastically in the past decade,
a major roadblock in identifying key genes driving stem cell-niche interactions is the lengthy process of
generating the genetic models needed (e.g., cell-type specific Cre or CreER, and overexpression or knockout
mouse lines) to test gene functions in a cell-type specific manner in a physiologically relevant context. As such,
while many different cell types have been identified and molecularly profiled, the critical genes that drive many
developmental and regeneration processes remain incompletely understood. This substantial knowledge gap
presents a significant impediment to developing therapies for skin diseases.
To address this gap and to showcase how rapid functional genetics can enable new discoveries in stem cell-
niche interactions, we will first build adeno-associated viral (AAV) toolkits to expand the field’s capacity for rapid
functional genetics in multiple dermal cell types in mice. This aim expands on our current success in using AAVs
to transduce dermal cells, with the goal of building tools that allows all skin researchers to modify gene
expression rapidly in dermal populations such as the dermal fibroblasts and DP. We have recently developed
and conducted SHARE-seq on the skin, a high-throughput single cell sequencing method that simultaneously
measures chromatin accessibility (single cell ATACseq) and gene expression (single cell RNAseq) within the
same cell. SHARE-seq data allow us to computationally infer key regulatory elements (enhancers, promoters)
of signature genes for distinct cell types, which further enables the construction of cell-type specific AAV tools.
We know the proposed strategy is feasible, because we have used it to build tools that can manipulate gene
expression in the arrector pili muscles (APMs), a cell type that currently lacks specific Cre/CreER constructs.
APMs are an emerging niche cell type for hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). However, the molecular mechanisms
by which APMs regulates HFSC behavior remain poorly understood. In Aim2, we will use our AAV tools to
discover APM-derived secreted factors that regulate HFSC activation and maintenance. Collectively, these
results will provide the skin community with much-needed tools to accelerate research in diverse topics, and
may be relevant for understanding and potentially treating a wide range of alopecia conditions. Since AAVs are
non-toxic and non-immunogenic, and since many key tissue-specific regulatory elements retain their specificity
across species, there is an exciting potential to combine our biological findings with our technical advancements
to develop novel gene therapy strategies to treat these skin diseases in the near future."
10756569,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Recent knowledge gained from studies based on scRNAseq provides new opportunities for the
characterization of cell types and description of phenotypes. In addition, information gained from scRNAseq
can help develop new reagents useful for functional studies. One of the main challenges in scRNAseq studies
to address is the mapping of scRNAseq clusters to anatomy. While this can be relatively easily done if a cluster
is defined by the unique expression of a single differentially expressed gene (DEG), the task is more
complicated if a group of cells can only be defined using a combination of DEGs. To identify combinations of
genes whose expression define cell clusters, we propose in Aim 1 to develop an algorithm that determines
the smallest unique set of marker genes that define a cluster. A number of approaches and resources can
be used to associate the expression of marker genes to the anatomy; however, in most cases co-expression of
multiple genes is required to properly map clusters to the anatomy, and existing reagents are limited. As the
split-Gal4 method, whereby the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and a transcriptional activator domain are
expressed independently under the control of two different enhancers, is scalable for the detection of multiple
genes, in Aim 2, we propose to build on our established TRiP/DRSC platform and generate a collection
of 1012 split-Gal4 lines that will be used to map the estimated 450 cell clusters present in the fly.
Importantly, the split-Gal4 lines generated from these studies will allow us to address a long-standing issue in
the Drosophila field, namely the specificity of existing Gal4 lines, as we and others have observed that the
large majority of so-called “tissue-specific” Gal4 driver lines are also expressed in additional, unwanted cell
types or tissues. Finally, as the current split-Gal4 system is not compatible with temporal control, preventing
the use of split-Gal4 lines for experiments requiring stage specific activation of the UAS driven transgene, in
Aim 3, we will develop a robust split-Gal4 method that allows temporal control and generate a
collection of 200 inducible split-Gal4 lines that will allow the generation of 100 controllable tissue
specific Gal4 patterns, covering most larval and adult tissues. Together, these resources will provide the
community with much needed reagents that will be made available and distributed as soon as they are
produced by the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center."

(Fayer et al., 2017). Additionally, Women, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), and people with disabilities
are underrepresented as both students and professionals in STEM fields (Rotermund & Burke, 2021; Hamrick, 2021). To
address the dire need to prepare students with key skills like communication and collaboration, and increase interest in
health and medicine careers especially among BIPOC, Killer Snails, a science-focused educational technology company,
will create VenomSquad, an augmented reality (AR) learning experience for 6-8th grade.
 We will foster an interest in STEM and future careers by creating an AR experience using mobile phones
where students take on roles as scientists working collaboratively in teams to understand how venom can be used
to make therapeutic drugs. VenomSquad will be a 5-day curriculum supplement that combines AR game play, an
interactive web-based digital science journal that reflects student interactions, and an innovative assessment dashboard for
educators which highlights student collaboration across platforms. In VenomSquad students will take on roles of scientists
collaboratively solving a real-world problem: finding new, non-addictive pain therapies based on the venom of extreme
creatures like snakes and cone snails. While the content we propose for VenomSquad is unique, the underlying technology
and principles of multimedia design for learning are generalizable to other content areas.
 VenomSquad has three innovative features: (1)Technical advancements in collaborative mobile AR. The
creation of VenomSquad will require new technical advancements (addressing bandwidth, latency, loss of connection) to
ensure a high level of collaboration for the student teams using AR. (2)Multiplayer design engine. The proprietary design
engine powering the digital science journal enables collaborative behaviors like communication and sharing resources
between students with different information based on their roles, while maintaining common ground within the group.
(3)Educator dashboard optimized for timely, contextual feedback. We will create an educator dashboard to display
actionable learning analytics drawn from qualitative and quantitative information about individual student work and
collaborative interactions between students in the digital science journal and the AR scenes. This display will highlight
evidence of successful collaboration or the need for support from the educator. This feature of the dashboard will help
educators assess each student and group’s AR and digital experience, addressing pain points for educators using
collaborative activities in classroom settings. Taken together, these features ensure VenomSquad will be unlike existing
Life/Physical Science materials on the market and will create a niche in which Killer Snails can grow.
 Our iterative approach to the design and testing of VenomSquad will examine how these features contribute to
students’ learning experiences. Our evaluation partner WestEd will conduct an RCT examining the extent to which
VenomSquad can affect students’ use of science and engineering practices, especially ability to effectively collaborate, and
interest in STEM careers, and educators’ ability to monitor and support students during collaborative activities."

The Partnership between New Mexico State University (NMSU), an Institution Serving Underserved Health
Disparities Populations and Underrepresented Students (ISUPS), and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred
Hutch), a Comprehensive Cancer Center, has matured into a strong, mutually beneficial partnership from its
start as a U56 (2002-2007) and three cycles as a U54 (2007-2023) Partnership. Over the past twenty years,
NMSU has increased its commitment to cancer research, and Fred Hutch has expanded its efforts in cancer
prevention, education, and health disparities. The Partnership has expanded and adapted opportunities for
research, education, training, and community engagement for historically excluded communities (HECs) in the
U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest, responding to its mission of improving cancer health equity. Population
health sciences and transdisciplinary studies are the focus of joint Research Projects to a greater extent than
in previous cycles. Expansion of the research education portfolio parallels an increased breadth of cancer and
health disparities Research Projects. Lastly, the Partnership has amplified the voices of the communities it
serves through community engaged research practices. The Partnership’s goals for the next U54 cycle are to
further increase excellence in cancer research, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination portfolios
while working towards accomplishing larger transformational changes within the Partnership. This competing
renewal application formulates and implements three Guiding Principles for the Partnership: Restructuring
Scientific Environments, Restructuring Scientific Processes, and Restructuring Scientific Engagement. These
principles bring new opportunities to strengthen equity, inclusion, and diversity across all activities proposed by
this U54 Partnership in support of the following three Specific Aims (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio
of robust cancer Research Projects that span clinical, basic and population health sciences (2) Implement,
evaluate, and improve our research education programs for current and future scientists from historically
excluded communities (HECs) (3) Collaborate with community organizations on outreach programs in New
Mexico and Washington State that work with underrepresented populations to reduce health disparities.
To achieve these aims, the Partnership has assembled innovative cancer Research Projects that address an
unmet regional needs and benefit from strong community input. Each Core - Administrative, Planning and
Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Resource for AcademIc
SuccEss (RAISE) - has also proposed activities to implement the Guiding Principles. The Partnership
formulated activities that are highly integrated across Research Projects and Cores to provide the necessary
resources to participants while advancing progress to meeting the Partnership’s mission."
10782995,"The ability to sense environmental temperature is essential for life. Molecular thermal sensors are a central
player in thermosensation. These thermal receptors are expressed in cold-sensitive neurons/cells in the
periphery. Work in the past two decades has identified a large number of TRP family channels as heat
receptors that sense a full range of warm and hot temperatures, spanning from 33°C to over 53°C. This has led
to a fairly clear understanding of how animals sense heat. By contrast, little is known about cold sensation.
Thus far, only one cold receptor (TRPM8) has been identified. TRPM8 senses cool temperatures with an
activation threshold at ~26°C and mediates cool sensation. As animals and humans are clearly capable of
sensing temperatures below 26°C, and TRPM8 knockout mice show robust responses to noxious cold,
unknown cold receptors, particularly those sensing noxious cold, must exist but remain to be identified. The
nematode C. elegans is a popular genetic model organism for sensory biology research. Like mammals, C.
elegans senses a full range of temperature cues. Importantly, sensory receptors and channels tend to be
evolutionarily conserved in C. elegans. This, together with its short generation time (~3 days) and facile and
rich genetic tools, makes C. elegans an ideal system for identifying novel cold receptors. We therefore
designed and conducted an unbiased, activity-based genetic screen for cold-sensing mutants in C. elegans,
using a real-time PCR thermocycler. We identified GLR-3, a kainate-type glutamate receptor homolog, as a
novel type of cold receptor that mediates cold sensation in C. elegans. Strikingly, the GLR-3 homolog GluK2
from fish, mouse and human can all function as a cold receptor in heterologous systems. We also found that
mouse GluK2 is expressed in the peripheral DRG sensory neurons. The activation threshold of GluK2 is below
20°C, suggesting that it mainly senses noxious cold rather than cool temperatures. As glutamate receptors are
best known to transmit chemical signals across synapses in the central nervous system, these results present
a striking case where a central chemical receptor, surprisingly, functions as a thermal receptor in the periphery.
Despite these exciting observations, many unanswered questions remain, particularly regarding the role of
mammalian GluK2 in cold sensation. For example, does GluK2 mediate cold sensation in mice? If so, how?
Here, we propose to address these questions by testing several hypotheses. To do so, we will leverage the
expertise from two research groups using a multidisciplinary approach combining molecular genetics,
behavioral analysis, calcium imaging, and electrophysiology. The proposed research will not only provide novel
insights into the mechanisms of cold sensation, but also unveil an unexpected role of glutamate receptors in
the periphery.

10783000,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide, leads to end-stage renal disease in
20-40% of patients and can reduce life expectancy by up to 10 years, as there is no known cure or disease-
specific treatment. Most IgAN patients, regardless of age and ethnicity, have immunologic defects resulting in
generation of pathogenic IgA1-containing immune complexes, which ultimately deposit in the kidneys to induce
renal injury. These renal immunodeposits likely originate from circulating immune complexes consisting of IgA1
with hinge-region galactose-deficient O-glycans (Gd-IgA1) bound by Gd-IgA1-specific IgG autoantibodies. The
long-term goal of this project is to define the underlying mechanisms that lead to the formation of pathogenic
immune complexes, so that IgAN-specific treatments can be developed. Our hypothesis is that a molecular-
level characterization of Gd-IgA1-specific IgG autoantibodies from IgAN patients coupled with an atomic-level
characterization of autoantibodies in immune complexes will significantly advance our understanding of
immune-complex formation in IgAN. This information will in-turn provide a basis for development of new
disease-specific treatments. Over the past three years, the laboratories of the investigators have utilized
biochemical, molecular, structural, and clinical studies to begin characterization of IgAN-specific
autoantibodies. We have shown that IgG autoantibodies from patients with IgAN harbor a sequence (amino
acids YCSR/K) at the junction of framework 3 and the CDR3 in the variable part of the heavy chain (VH),
wherein the serine residue is essential for Gd-IgA1 binding. This serine residue originates from a somatic
hypermutation (Ala->Ser) and not from a genetic mutation of a VH germline gene. Our crystallographic studies
with an IgAN-derived (YCSK) and a germline-reverted (YCAK) recombinant IgG autoantibody revealed that
this seemingly minor difference in the amino-acid sequence had allosteric effects on elements surrounding the
serine residue, generating a new surface juxtaposed to the CDR loops. This surface is a potential binding site
for part of the Gd-IgA1 hinge-region glycopeptide and is a potential target for the design of IgG autoantibody
inhibitors. In this proposal, we will determine the population- and individual-level variability of IgG
autoantibodies in IgAN based on VH/VL sequences and Gd-IgA1 binding (Aim 1), determine the structural
features of representative IgG autoantibodies and the molecular mechanism of Gd-IgA1 recognition (Aim 2),
and develop approaches to block the binding of IgG autoantibodies to Gd-IgA1 (Aim 3). By leveraging our
access to biobanked clinical samples, new patients, the new high-throughput approaches for cloning and
expression of IgG autoantibodies specific Gd-IgA1, high-resolution methods for structural analyses, and high-
throughput testing of inhibitors, our studies have progressed to a stage where molecular-level assessments of
the autoantibodies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that drive IgAN disease. The results of
our studies will define disease-specific targets to prevent pathogenic immune-complex formation in IgAN."
10783005,"ABSTRACT
Central nervous system (CNS) complications continue to occur among adults aging with HIV. For example,
neurocognitive impairment occurs in 30-50% of persons with HIV (PWH). With advancing age, cognitive and
mood disorders such as depression increase in frequency and in severity. While research to date has focused
on the biological mechanisms associated with the aging of the CNS (e.g., amyloid-related pathology), few studies
have focused on aging and prescribed, potentially neurotoxic drugs influence the effects of HIV and antiretroviral
therapy (ART) on cognition and depression. Studies of neurotoxicity of ART drugs and prescribed drugs in older
PWH have largely been limited by small sample sizes, suboptimal neurocognitive characterization, and relatively
short follow-up. This proposal will address these limitations by using data and specimens from nearly 20,000
comprehensive medical and neurobehavioral assessments collected over more than 20 years. CNS
complications, such as neurocognitive impairment and major depression disorder, are a key area for
multidisciplinary studies of HIV and aging in order to characterize the interactions between HIV, comorbid
diseases, and their treatment and to gain insights into the pathogenesis of these complications that may inform
therapeutics. The overarching hypothesis is that prescribed drug-related neurotoxicity increasingly contributes
to the incidence and persistence of CNS complications in PWH as they age. To address this, the proposed
project is organized into three aims: 1) Determine how age and concomitantly prescribed drugs modify the
relationships between ART drugs and neurocognitive performance or depression using a longitudinal database
of more than 20,000 comprehensive assessments and advanced analytical methods; 2) Determine how age and
concomitantly prescribed drugs modify the dose-effect relationships between ART drugs and NC performance
and depression using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling; and 3) Explore the mechanisms by
which concomitant drugs modify ART neurotoxicity using a novel high-throughput, inducible human pluripotent
stem cell culture method and extracellular vesicle characterization. The completion of this proposal will provide
valuable data on how aging interacts with prescribed drugs to increase the risk of ART neurotoxicity and CNS
complications. The results may also inform future interventions to prevent and treat CNS complications in older
PWH."
10783007,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common malignant bone tumor in humans and dogs, shares several features in
both species including clinical presentation and molecular alterations. Despite numerous efforts there have been
no improvements in disease outcome for either species in the past three decades: 30% of people and 90% of
dogs still die of metastasis. While some approaches have shown promise in the setting of microscopic disease,
in both species, macroscopic metastasis exhibits inherent resistance to multiple agents (kinase inhibitors,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, among others). I recently characterized the canine OS genome and found that
as with human OS, the somatic mutational load is low, copy number aberrations/structural variants predominate,
and no clear molecular drivers are evident. These data, along with a history of failed clinical trial efforts suggest
that contemporary approaches to therapeutic advancement such as kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint
blockade will likely have limited clinical impact, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic
strategies. A distinguishing feature of cancer cells is their ability to undergo aerobic glycolysis, allowing them to
thrive in a variety of microenvironments. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are key facilitators of this, moving
lactic acid across the plasma membrane, and are critical for growth and metastasis of glycolytic tumors, such as
OS. In previous work, I found that loss of MCT1 or MCT4 function in OS cells decreases basal and compensatory
glycolysis, cellular proliferation and invasive capacity. I also showed that MCT4 is a direct transcriptional target
of STAT3 and FOXM1, both of which exhibit constitutive activation in OS, supporting a link between
MCT4/STAT3/FOXM1 and aerobic glycolysis. Building on these data, I will by leverage a comparative cross-
species approach to first define regulatory circuits that support aerobic glycolysis mediated by MCT1/MCT4 in
OS and then identify and validate therapeutic vulnerabilities related to MCT control of cellular metabolism. I
hypothesize that in OS cells, sustained MCT1/MCT4 expression is driven by constitutive STAT3/FOXM1
activation and increased MYC copy number, thereby promoting aerobic glycolysis. I further predict that
loss of MCT1/MCT4 through genetic manipulation or targeted inhibitors will impair tumor growth in vivo,
and that this can be maximized through rational drug combination. To accomplish this, I will first
characterize the transcriptional regulation of MCT1/MCT4 in OS using a combination of ChIP-sequencing,
bisulfite sequencing and 4C/ChiA-PET analysis. Xenograft studies in mice will complement in vitro analyses to
assess how loss of MCT1/4 function affects OS metabolic profile, tumor phenotype and tumor growth. Lastly, I
will use a zebrafish model to screen select agents for synthetic lethality with MCT blockade, then validate findings
in mice. The rich research environment afforded by Tufts University and its partners ensures access to resources
and expertise necessary for completion of the proposed work. My training in veterinary oncology, clinical trials
and genetics along with guidance from my mentoring team with expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, animal
models and translational oncology make me well positioned for successful transition to independence."
10780619,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Schizophrenia is a devastating and burdensome illness that afflicts ~1% of the global population. Cognitive
symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, affecting most individuals with schizophrenia, and being responsible
for the greatest reduction in quality of life. Despite their significant impact, the biological mechanisms of
cognitive deficits remain elusive, in part due to limitations of the experimental approaches typically used to
study them in humans. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach using biophysical
modeling as an explanatory theoretical framework for bridging the translational gap between previous
preclinical work in mouse models of schizophrenia-relevant risk and the proposed work in patients with
schizophrenia. We propose translation of the findings of reduced neuronal ensemble reliability (n-ER) in the
primary visual cortex (V1) as a window into a brain-wide circuit-level alteration in schizophrenia and its
relationship to cognitive deficits. To achieve this, we will use a combined sample of 1,760 individuals, including
healthy individuals, patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and their first-degree relatives, from the
HCP Young Adult, HCP Psychosis, and HCP Early Psychosis projects. Specifically, we will measure voxel
ensemble reliability (v-ER) in humans using resting-state and visual-stimulation fMRI data—akin to calcium
imaging studies in mice— as a theoretically grounded and translational index of excitation-inhibition balance
(E/I) in cortical circuits. First, we aim to develop a biophysical model of V1 constrained by preclinical and basic
neuroscience experiments, and test model predications of neuroimaging measures related to E/I. Second, we
will test for reduced v-ER in patients with schizophrenia—directly translating preclinical findings—and use
biophysical model simulations to identify potential biological mechanisms. Third, we will use the unique sample
characteristics of the HCP Psychosis project (patients and first-degree relatives) to investigate the relationship
between genetic burden for schizophrenia and v-ER. Fourth, given the convergence of cognitive deficits in the
preclinical mouse models, we will examine the relationship between v-ER and cognitive performance. We will
further seek to establish reduced v-ER as a brain-wide mechanism of cognitive deficits by testing for
relationships in cognition across disparate sensory domains. Throughout, we will use well-powered, rigorous,
state-of-the-art fMRI and statistical data-driven methods suitable for large-scale studies and HCP-like fMRI
sequences, including cross-validation and independent confirmation. Together with a strong theoretical
foundation and using biophysical modeling to complement fMRI analyses, this approach will begin to elucidate
the biological mechanisms of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. In doing so, this project will establish v-ER as
a fully translational neuroimaging measure with the potential to be used as a biomarker for treatment selection
and target engagement and will generate predictions that can be directly tested in preclinical studies."

There are no pharmacotherapies for stimulant abuse, including methamphetamine (METH) and relapse rates 
are high. Relapse triggered by reminders of drug use is a particular challenge to prevent, as the underlying 
memories exert a powerful motivational influence over behavior and represent a lifelong relapse risk factor. 
Learning is supported by structural plasticity in dendritic spines, driven by training-­induced actin polymer-­
ization. Memory stability is subsequently achieved by arresting actin dynamics, stabilizing the cytoskeleton. As 
a result, memory is impervious to actin depolymerization within minutes of learning. However, prior work in the 
lab discovered that the actin cytoskeleton supporting METH memories remains uniquely dynamic in the 
amygdala long after training. This enables selective, retrieval-­independent disruption of METH-­associated 
memories and drug seeking with a single administration of an actin depolymerizer. Because actin’s critical 
roles in the body limit its therapeutic potential, focus shifted to nonmuscle myosin II (NMII), a direct driver of 
learning-­stimulated actin polymerization in spines. The effect of NMII inhibition is specific to the amygdala and 
METH. Indeed, NMII inhibition has no effect on METH memories when other regions of the drug-­memory 
neural circuit are targeted and there is no similar retrieval-­independent effect on memories for fear, food 
reward or other drugs of abuse, including opioids. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of NMII established it 
is a viable therapeutic target and an NIH-­funded medication development project for a clinically safe NMII 
inhibitor is underway (UH3 NS096833). However, fundamental knowledge needed to understand and further 
leverage this specificity is lacking. This will be addressed through the central hypothesis in this new project: 
that METH-­associated memories are uniquely supported in the amygdala by NMII, leaving those memories 
selectively vulnerable to disruption long after learning, even when other associative learning is introduced. The 
focus of this application is two-­fold: (1) The key mechanistic question regarding the specific requirement of 
the amgydala, actin-­NMII and METH for selective memory storage disruption will be addressed. For this, the 
impact of METH-­related neuromodulators (Aim 1), as well as NMII phosphorylation and interacting partners 
(Aim 2) will be studied on NMII-­dependent BLA synaptic actin dynamics and METH-­associated memory, with a 
focus on factors that are unique to METH and the BLA. Once identified, the mechanism(s) responsible could 
be harnessed to render relapse-­inducing memories for other drugs of abuse vulnerable to disruption. (2) 
Because most individuals with METH use disorder use multiple substances, including opioids, it is necessary 
to determine the impact of polydrug administration on METH memory susceptibility to NMII inhibition. 
Preliminary data indicate that METH confers susceptibility to previously impervious opioid associations. 
Technically innovative approaches will be employed throughout the project, spanning from single synapse 
manipulations in live tissue slices to memory-­based self-­administration studies.

10745956,"SUMMARY: Acquired epilepsy is a chronic condition that requires life-long medication and is often drug-
resistant. The development of more efficient drugs to prevent or reduce epilepsy is currently hindered by a gap
in knowledge of how an epilepsy-precipitating event turns a healthy brain into a brain that produces spontaneous
recurrent seizures. This process, known as epileptogenesis, is thought to be highly complex. Halting or
preventing epileptogenesis thus most likely requires the concerted manipulation of many different molecular
networks and pathways. It is therefore plausible that treatment strategies targeting regulatory mechanisms that
control multiple of these cellular pathways at once will be most successful. This research will address this
challenge by analyzing how a potent regulator of the expression of hundreds of genes, the microRNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC), contributes to epileptogenic processes after status epilepticus (SE). Previous work
supports a role of microRNAs and the RISC in epilepsy development by showing that select microRNAs and
mRNAs are recruited to the RISC after seizure, and that inhibition of single microRNAs reduces seizure
susceptibility and epileptogenesis in rodent epilepsy models. Yet, the molecular mechanisms and pathways
underlying the seizure-mitigating effects of microRNA manipulation are largely unknown. The overall hypothesis
of this research is that SE induces changes in RISC and microRNA function that enhance epileptogenic and
decrease neuroprotective pathways. Inhibiting these changes may prevent or impair the development of
epilepsy. This hypothesis will be tested with two aims. Aim 1 will follow an unbiased approach using cell type-
specific immunoprecipitation of the RISC, RNA sequencing and genetic knockdown strategies to reveal the
nature and functional relevance of molecular pathways that are differentially regulated by the RISC after SE in
mice. Aim 2 will follow a candidate-based approach using ribosomal tagging and functional assays together with
antisense-mediated microRNA inhibition to reveal the cell-specific translatome of a pro-convulsive microRNA
and how it contributes to epileptogenesis after SE. Based on complementing expertise of neuroscientists and
computational biologists, the approach to perform screens of RISC and microRNA target regulation after SE
paired with pathway and functional analyses is expected to generate unique information about the complex
processes regulating epileptogenesis. The innovative strategy using RISC association as a surrogate for
microRNA function, and association of mRNAs with the RISC or actively translating ribosomes as a surrogate
for their silencing or translation, respectively, is expected to provide an improved functional assessment of the
silencing activity of microRNAs and the effect on target mRNAs compared to previous expression analyses. This
study will fill a crucial gap in the understanding of RISC function, protein expression and pathway dysregulation
in epileptogenesis, which will be vital to advance microRNA-induced silencing as therapeutic target. Seen from
a broader perspective, this strategy could serve as a blueprint for RISC analysis in other diseases."
10746011,"ABSTRACT
Repeated major depressive episodes are particularly problematic for older adults who have a more brittle
recovery than younger adults. Our data show that, despite antidepressant treatment, almost 60% of remitted
older adults experience recurrence within four years. Beyond simply relying on past history and reported
current stress, it is unclear what neurobiological factors are prospectively associated with recurrence risk,
when these factors trigger recurrence, and how they contribute to the high rates of cognitive impairment
observed in late-life depression (LLD). Using a model of network homeostasis, we posit that depressive
episodes are characterized by disrupted homeostasis in key neural networks involved in affect regulation and
cognitive function. Our preliminary data indicate that treatment non-remitters have residual functional network
alterations and high network instability (higher fluctuations in temporal signal-to-noise ratio). We hypothesize
that remitters with residual functional network alterations and greater instability remain at high risk of
recurrence with subsequent stress exposure. This disequilibrium contributes to subsyndromal symptoms
followed by full recurrence. These processes may also contribute to the higher rate of cognitive impairment and
decline observed in LLD. Our groups have reported elevated rates of cognitive decline in remitted LLD and an
association of recurrence with accelerated brain aging. We hypothesize that greater neural reactivity to stress
may accelerate brain aging and cognitive decline and that deficits/variability in performance on tasks
dependent on ECN may serve as markers of network alterations and signal increased recurrence risk. The
goals of this study are to A) identify neurobiological factors that predict recurrence risk, and B) examine how
cognitive performance changes are both influenced by these same neurobiological factors and also predict
recurrence risk. Our approach is to conduct a three-site, two-year longitudinal study of remitted LLD and
never-depressed elders. Every 8 months we will conduct laboratory assessments, including clinical, cognitive
and neuroimaging assessments and an in-scanner stress paradigm, along with burst ecological momentary
assessments (EMA) of mood variability, stress exposure, cognitive performance, and passive actigraphy. As
an exploratory goal, we will examine whether continuous ecological monitoring of mood and activity can
provide early detection of recurrence. A subgroup will be continuously monitored by EMA and actigraphy for
state shifts (persistent worsening) or variance shifts (increased variability) in symptom severity. When shifts in
mood symptoms are identified, they will engage in ad-hoc clinical and neuroimaging testing. Results from this
study may be translated in clinical practice through the future development of easy-to-use platforms (e.g. apps)
that signal to clinicians increased risk of impending recurrence, thus allowing for swift therapeutic intervention."
10745961,"Surfactant insufficiency compromises pulmonary compliance and respiratory function in multiple pulmonary
pathologies. Our understanding of surfactant metabolism in adult pulmonary disease is very limited and this
restricts the potential for therapeutic targeting. In this project, we have generated a new genetic model of
surfactant insufficiency in adult disease by deleting the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1)
specifically in surfactant producing type 2 cells (AEC2). LRP1 functions as lipoprotein receptor and extracellular
protease clearing receptor and it is associated with decreased respiratory function in patients with COPD and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Studies in our generated cell line of LRP1 knockdown AEC2 (LRP1 KD) and
tamoxifen-inducible AEC2-specific LRP1 knockout mice (SPC-LRP1-/-) show that LRP1 is required to maintain
surfactant lipid secretion and intracellular lipid homeostasis to ensure optimal pulmonary compliance and
respiratory function. We hypothesize that LRP1 controls surfactant metabolism in AEC2 and we will study the
regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 1 we will decipher the mechanism of action of LRP1 at the membrane level in
AEC2 and its regulation of the lipid source for surfactant synthesis in AEC2. In Aim 2 we will investigate the
epithelial to mesenchymal cross talk and the role of LRP1 in the progressive decline in lung function during
profibrotic challenges and molecular mechanisms responsible. We will attempt a new therapeutic approach to
stop the decline.
 This proposal is innovative conceptually and technically. The role of AEC2 lipid metabolism during adult
pulmonary disease is unknown. LRP1 regulates many cellular functions through lipid metabolism in different
tissues and our study shows that it also regulates pulmonary function through surfactant lipid metabolism. In
addition, we use novel techniques that include inducible and cell-specific genetic knockout models in vivo lipid
tracing and -omics analysis. Surfactant homeostasis enables basic pulmonary function, but the regulation of
surfactant homeostasis in adult disease is very little understood. The significance of this research is further
underscored by the fact that surfactant lipid is altered in multiple pulmonary pathologies, including the most
prevalent ones."
10746066,"Abstract
Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is a disease and disparity that disproportionately affects Asian American (AA)
females. In contrast to declining incidence trends seen among most racial/ethnic groups, incidence of lung cancer,
especially adenocarcinoma, has been increasing in most AA ethnic groups. The majority of AA females, upwards of
nearly 90% among Chinese, diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked. There is very little known of the
contributing risk factors to the high and increasing incidence rates of LCINS among AA females, particularly as risk
factors identified in studies in Asia may have limited significance among AA populations. Moreover, there is limited
understanding of the relationships between the mutational signatures of tumors among this population and their
associated risk factors. Such information will improve our understanding of the underlying potential mechanistic
pathways. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to identify the attributable risk of known, putative, and suspected
risk factors for lung cancer among AA female never smokers. Recognizing that currently there are no U.S. datasets
nor existing cohorts with data for evaluating putative and suspected risk factors that may be most relevant to this
population, we propose a robust, population-based case-control study, leveraging early-case ascertainment methods
from cancer registries and tested state-of-the-science approaches for unbiased control ascertainment. With high-
quality, multilevel data collected from an estimated 600 female AA never-smoker lung cancer cases and 600
ethnicity and age frequency-matched controls, we aim to: Aim 1a. Identify risk factors for LCINS among AA females,
with attention to differences by histology and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) status (determined using
whole exome sequencing [WES]), and focusing on multi-level factors including: a) genetic ancestry; b) individual-
level exposures, including putative and suspected risk factors; and c) contextual-level risk factors including indoor
and ambient air pollutants and the social environment, with consideration of nativity and years in the U.S. versus
Asia; Aim 1b. Determine the independent and joint contributions of multi-level risk factors to LCINS among AA
females by calculating the attributable risk for each risk factor, individually and in total; Aim 2a. Characterize the
mutational landscape of LCINS among AA females, through WES of paired tumor-normal tissue samples to define
somatic mutation profiles, mutational signatures, and EGFR status of LCINS AA females; and Aim 2b. Identify multi-
level risk factors associated with the major mutational tumor features. All aims will assess potential differences by
EGFR status. The proposed research will involve the assembly of the largest population-based lung cancer case-
control dataset, with associated genetic and tumor genomic data, for never-smoking AA women. It will provide a first-
ever opportunity to evaluate detailed multilevel factors contributing to the lung cancer disparity in distinct AA ethnic
groups. A clear understanding of the etiologic factors underlying the high and increasing lung cancer risk among AA
never-smoker females is necessary for designing the appropriate prevention strategies to reduce their high burden of
disease."

This proposed project relates to the development and evaluation of a novel closed-loop long-term oxygen
therapy control system that includes an innovative smartphone-based companion software application. We
hypothesize that such a system will optimize oxygen delivery in mobile patients, minimize hypoxemia and air
hunger during physical exertion, avoid hyperoxia and improve patient health-related quality of life. More than
1.5 million Americans are currently receiving long-term oxygen therapy. Drawbacks to long-term oxygen
therapy include significant limitations to patient physical activity, a heightening of social isolation and decline in

10761741,"Project Summary / Abstract
Few pharmacological interventions have been studied to reduce postoperative delirium, and their efficacy is
inconclusive and controversial at best. Our objective is to find an effective prophylactic intervention for
postoperative delirium, one of the most common and detrimental complications of cardiac surgery in older adults.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that scheduled prophylactic 6-hourly IV acetaminophen can prevent
postoperative delirium in older cardiac surgical patients when administered in the first 48 hours following surgery.
The rationale underlying this proposal is that while multiple etiological factors exist for the development of
delirium, modifiable risk factors include inflammation, undertreated pain, and use of opioids. Each of these is an
independent risk factor for delirium that is amenable to intervention with use of IV acetaminophen. Through this
straightforward intervention, it is possible to use a highly prevalent, non-toxic medication to address a well-known
problem. We propose three specific aims by conducting a randomized, triple blind clinical trial that enrolls 900
patients 60 years of age or older undergoing cardiac surgery. Through this trial, we will determine the effect of
IV acetaminophen on; 1) the incidence, duration, and severity of postoperative delirium, 2) the use of opioids
and other rescue analgesics in the first 48 postoperative hours, daily pain scores at rest and exertion, and length
of stay in the Intensive Care Unit and overall hospital length of stay 3) longer-term (one, six, 12 months) cognitive,
physical, and self-care functional recovery after surgery. We will pursue these aims using an innovative method
of administering a routine drug intravenously in scheduled, six hourly intervals for 48 hours, which is the period
of maximum secondary injury, inflammation, and pain postoperatively. The proposed research is significant
because it will determine whether targeting inflammation and pain through a multimodal analgesic approach can
reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in a vulnerable, aging population. The expected outcome of this
work, which will be interesting regardless of the findings, will be to determine the role of IV acetaminophen
in the prevention of delirium, and in pain management for older cardiac surgery patients. The results will have
an important positive impact as they will facilitate either widespread adoption of IV acetaminophen as a pain
control modality for older adults undergoing major surgery, or to provide strong evidence to eliminate its use if it
is proven to be ineffective. Additionally, we will further our understanding of the association between pain
management modalities and delirium, and other important short and long term outcomes of older adults
undergoing cardiac surgery."
10932246,"ABSTRACT – FULL PROJECT 3 ADM
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most devastating cancers with poor prognosis
and rising incidence. To combat this deadly disease, we should direct our efforts towards preventing PDAC or
halting the progression of precursor lesions to invasive disease parallel to developing novel treatments. One of
the earliest known initiating events for PDAC is the process of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Understanding
and reduction of ADM formation may reduce early PDAC development and progression. Blacks display a
significantly increased incidence and mortality from PDAC compared to other races for unknown reasons. The
role of race on pancreatic ADM and its contributions to the development and progression of PDAC need to be
addressed. In our previously funded CaRE2 Pilot Project, we used normal pancreatic acinar tissues from Black,
White and Hispanic donors to study the impact of race on acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and found that
Blacks undergo ADM to a greater extent than Whites or Hispanics. In this proposed Full Project as part of the
CaRE2 renewal, we will expand on and extend our previous pilot project by including diseased tissues from CP
and PDAC from White, Black, and Hispanic donors since accumulating evidence suggest that chronic
pancreatitis (CP) is a major precursor to the development of PDAC. We will investigate the impact of race on the
cellular and molecular events regulating the interplay between ADM and the microenvironment. Guided by our
published and unpublished results, we hypothesize that the racial disparities seen in PDAC are related to
differences in how the pancreas microenvironment develops during ADM, which means that ADM and its
surrounding microenvironment can be used as a target to treat PDAC. We propose the following specific aims
to address this hypothesis: Aim 1: The influence of race on ADM of healthy pancreas, CP, and PDAC-associated
acinar tissues. Aim 2: The roles of pancreatic stellate cells and macrophages in ADM and ADM reversal Aim 3:
Contributions of the race to ADM reversal and cell heterogeneity. The proposed studies will impact the field of
pancreatic cancer by providing a missing link between disparities, ADM, tumor microenvironment, and potential
treatments for CP and PDAC. The specific focus on the racial contributions of microenvironment remolding
during pancreatic metaplasia aligns with the Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement
(CaRE2) Health Equity Center’s overall goal to eliminate cancer health disparities among Black and Latino
individuals in California, Florida, and across the U.S."

Modern indirect calorimetry systems allow for high-density multi-dimensional time-series measurements of
components affecting body weight and energy homeostasis. Indirect calorimetry is used for understanding the
factors influencing pathogenic changes to body weight—examples include weight loss with cancer cachexia, or
weight gain with obesity. These indirect calorimetry systems generate a flood of raw data that requires time-
consuming manual manipulation for formatting, data cleaning, quality control, and visualization. Beyond data
handling, analysis of indirect calorimetry experiments requires specialized statistical treatment to account for
differential contributions of fat mass and lean mass to metabolic rates. Surprisingly, no tools or resources exist
to address these shortcomings. Comparisons between experiments are rarely performed due to the different
types of instruments with varying units of measurement and ad hoc statistical treatments of data. To address
this critical need, we propose the creation of a free online tool, CalR, that helps scientists quickly and efficiently
analyze indirect calorimetry data by providing standardized methods for reproducible research and a site to
store and aggregate datasets. The preliminary version of CalR we launched is a user-friendly but sophisticated
web tool that uses a graphical user interface to import data files from different instruments, quickly visualize
experimental results, and perform basic statistical analyses. After several years of iterative development, in
addition to constructive feedback from a user survey, it is clear that additional functionality and statistical
methods need to be developed to realize the potential of this project. The broad goal of this research is the
development of a framework that delivers modern tools for the analysis of the physiological data affecting body
weight. These new tools, built on the existing CalR software, will continue to be freely provided to the scientific
community. Specific aims will establish three aspects of this framework: 1) New analysis features intended to
improve prediction of body weight change, automatic determination of metabolic flexibility, improved
determination of metabolic rates, and better visualizations. 2) New statistical methods incorporating additional
covariates into analysis and a module to determine statistical power for metabolic experiments. 3) The
development of a repository where indirect calorimetry data can be deposited and made broadly accessible for
large-scale analysis. For each aim, we will develop and thoroughly test each component, after which we will
provide a functional web tool online to share with the thousands of scientists who use our free software
platform. These efforts will extract more nuanced information and will improve the interpretation of each
experiment for users in all fields where body weight impacts disease processes."

Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection in critically ill patients and is characterized by
severe tissue breakdown, leading to long-term muscle weakness, fatigue, and reduced physical activity. Early
and targeted nutritional intervention is critical in enhancing rehabilitation from critical illness. The continuing
high morbidity and mortality rate in sepsis illustrates the clinical and scientific need to dissect the underlying
mechanisms by which sepsis induces accelerated catabolic response in muscle, and to assess the
effectiveness of targeted nutritional approaches during rehabilitation from sepsis. The rationale is that the
mechanistic insights generated will lay the foundation for the development of novel nutritional approaches for
critically ill patients to enhance rehabilitation through improved muscle health and physical activity. The use of
translational animal models is essential. Therapeutic nutritional support in pig models is viewed as highly
translational to humans. Our pig sepsis rehabilitation model shows many characteristics of human sepsis
rehabilitation like reduced muscle protein synthesis and increased protein breakdown, muscle weakness,
reduced activity and lower muscle autophagy.
 The first aim of the proposed study is to test the hypothesis that a targeted, combined nutritional
formulation of β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB anti-catabolic) and essential amino acids (EAA, anabolic)
is superior to EAA alone or control in attenuating severe tissue breakdown during rehabilitation from sepsis.
The hypothesis is that the EAA+HMB combination will simultaneously increase muscle protein synthesis,
attenuate muscle catabolism and wasting, and improve the rehabilitation of muscle function, leading to
enhanced physical activity. The second aim is to identify the metabolic and molecular mechanisms through
which supplementation attenuates the dysregulated proteostasis that causes the severe protein breakdown.
The proposed specific aims will be studied in our clinically relevant pig model of rehabilitation from an acute
Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. The nutritional intervention will be studied using a randomized, controlled,
double-blind 3 arm design (EAA+HMB vs. EAA vs. control). The proposed study is innovative because a) the
targeted novel approach of EAA+HMB nutritional supplementation to attenuate tissue breakdown and restore
muscle function and functional outcome (strength, fatigue and physical activity) and b) mechanistic insights into
sepsis-induced severe tissue breakdown and recovery. The use of an innovative stable tracer methodology
with muscle and plasma sampling will enable the quantification of all metabolic fluxes and molecular endpoints.
The results of the proposed study will have a positive impact by providing a mechanistic basis for the
development of novel, cost-effective nutritional approaches for patients recovering from sepsis that will
enhance their rehabilitation through improved muscle health and physical activity. Moreover, the obtained
results will provide a strong justification for rapid translation into clinical application."

Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, opportunistic, intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes food borne
illness. Given its well-characterized infection cycle and genetic amenability, L. monocytogenes provides a
powerful tool to interrogate the fundamental aspects of intracellular bacterial pathogenesis and the host immune
response to invasion by intracellular pathogens. L. monocytogenes that enter into the host cell cytosol secrete
the second messenger signaling nucleotide, c-di-AMP, resulting in innate immune activation by the host cell. We
recently identified the host protein RECON as a key mediator of this response. RECON is an enzyme whose
activity is inhibited by c-di-AMP. C-di-AMP inhibition of RECON results in the accumulation of the ROS byproduct
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), which augments NF-kB activation, resulting in elevated nitric oxide synthase
expression and NO production during infection. Intriguingly, we have revealed that NO produced by the host cell
promotes L. monocytogenes intracellular motility, rather than restricting bacterial growth, and that L.
monocytogenes exhibits extreme NO resistance. Additionally, preliminary studies have revealed that 4-HNE is
ubiquitously induced by eukaryotic cells following exposure to bacteria and that this reactive aldehyde exhibits
antimicrobial effects on bacteria analogous to NO. Furthermore, L. monocytogenes exhibits extreme resistance
to the antimicrobial effects of 4-HNE and induces a specific transcriptional response to 4-HNE exposure, which
we hypothesize promotes survival within the infected host. We have begun in vitro biochemical studies, in vivo
forward genetic studies, and the murine models of infection to interrogate the mechanisms by which L.
monocytogenes counteracts the antimicrobial effects of NO and 4-HNE and utilizes NO to promote virulence. In
Aim I, we will interrogate the mechanisms used by L. monocytogenes to detoxify and counteract the antimicrobial
effects of 4-HNE. In Aim II, we propose to detail the molecular mechanisms of NO resistance and the impacts
on bacterial virulence. Finally, in Aim III we will detail the mechanism of NO induced L. monocytogenes actin-
based motility and explore the in vivo impacts of this process on bacterial invasion and dissemination. Together
these studies will define the molecular mechanisms of exquisite antimicrobial innate immune responses
employed by L. monocytogenes to promote survival within the eukaryotic host.

10764905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Optimal flow of blood within the brain is ensured by two processes: (1) autoregulation, a collection of intrinsic
mechanisms that continuously adjust the microcirculation to maintain a constant flow of blood in the face of
changes in perfusion pressure, and (2) neurovascular coupling, an ensemble of cerebral vasculature
physiological processes that tightly match local blood flow to the needs of metabolically active regions of the
brain. These distinctive responses are necessary for brain health and function but remain incompletely
understood. Further, loss of microvascular control is associated with common age-related cerebrovascular
pathologies, including stroke, cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVDs), and vascular cognitive impairment and
dementia (VCID). The overarching goal of this proposal is to address this critical knowledge gap by providing a
better understand of how the brain’s ever-changing milieu of physical, environmental, endocrine, paracrine,
metabolic, and neurochemical stimuli are sensed by the cerebral microvasculature at the cellular level, and how
these signals are processed to ensure homeostasis and adaptability. The primary mechanistic focus of our
research is ion channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family—polymodal sensors of many types of
physical and chemical stimuli present in all cells. Over the past 10 years, our research team has discovered that
TRPM4 (TRP melastatin 4) and TRPML1 (TRP mucolipin 1) channels in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells
are important for the development of myogenic tone, a fundamental autoregulatory mechanism, and has
demonstrated critical sensory roles for TRPA1 (TRP ankyrin 1) and TRPV3 (TRP vanilloid 3) channels on the
endothelium of cerebral arteries and arterioles. Continuing with this theme and using advanced biomedical
imaging approaches and next-generation genetic mouse models, we will weave together the central concepts
established by our independent projects to develop a comprehensive overview of TRP channels as cellular
sensors in the cerebral microvasculature. Examples of proposed studies include investigations that will define
the nanoscale architecture of TRP channel signaling networks in health and disease using superresolution
microscopy, elucidate how TRPML1 channels are endogenously regulated in smooth muscle cells to prevent
vascular hypercontractility during myogenic vasoconstriction, and test the hypothesis that TRPA1 channels on
brain capillary endothelial cells act as detectors of reactive oxygen species to promote neurovascular coupling.
We will layer basic science investigations intended to elucidate fundamental regulatory mechanisms with
research designed to understand how processes controlled by TRP channels go wrong and contribute to the
transformation of healthy small vessels in the brain to a disease state during aging. To further this goal, we are
developing and characterizing new genetic models of age-related cSVDs and VCID in collaboration with
investigators at UCSF, and propose to use this unique resource to explore themes that include the involvement
of TRPM4, TRPML1, and TRPA1 channels in cerebral vascular dysfunction during age-related cSVDs and VCID."
10764907,"Autoimmune disease is the third most common disease category after cancer and heart disease. Current
therapies often rely on broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs to reduce inflammation and thus prevent
permanent organ damage and chronic disease. Neutrophils are considered short-lived cells with degradative
properties that associate with organ damage in diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s to
lupus nephritis. Deletion of activating FcγRs, receptors for IgG protects from organ damage in many mouse
models of autoimmune diseases and FcγR SNPs are linked to rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other
autoimmune disorders. We have shown that IgG-immune complex deposition within blood vessels triggers
rapid neutrophil capture via their own FcγRs and subsequent renal injury in a model of glomerulonephritis,
suggesting that neutrophil FcγRs serve as a key link between IgG deposition and organ damage. What is the
fate of activated neutrophils? Neutrophils can transdifferentiate into dendritic cells (DC) in response to
cytokines in vitro and neutrophils with DC markers (nDC) are observed in inflamed mouse and human
tissues. This suggests that the neutrophil imprint may go beyond the acute stages of inflammation. Based
on preliminary data in mouse models and lupus patient blood we propose the following. Neutrophil FcγR
engagement with multivalent IgG-complexed antigen induces neutrophil transdifferentiation into
immunogenic, antigen cross-presenting nDCs that elicit T cell dependent acquired immunity and organ
damage, which contributes to the transition from acute to chronic autoimmune disease. This hypothesis will
be tested using our humanized FcγR mice, neutrophil reporter mice, mouse models of autoimmune target
organ injury and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient blood coupled with transcriptome profiling,
functional assays and multiphoton intravital microscopy. In specific aims, we propose to understand the
molecular underpinnings of the FcγR dependent neutrophil to DC transition, the evolution of nDC fate,
trafficking and immunogenic profile during the course of IgG mediated inflammation and the role of nDCs in
promoting organ damage. Here, we will focus on nephrotoxic nephritis, a model of glomerulonephritis that
mimics aspects of the effector phase of lupus nephritis, and T cell mediated tubulointerstitial nephritis, which
are leading causes of end stage renal disease, but fully anticipate a broader applicability of our results to
other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Successful completion of our aims will lead to the characterization
of a unique population of potent antigen presenting cells that develop from neutrophils exposed to
autoantibody-ICs and may provide evidence that they establish a feed forward loop that fuels inflammation
and thus increases the risk for transition to chronic autoimmune disease. We anticipate that this will lay the
groundwork for elucidating novel points for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune disorders."
10764915,"Normal brain function relies on the correct assembly of neural circuits during development. This process starts with the
patterning of neural progenitors along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes to give rise to distinct subtypes of
neurons. A number of key transcription factors (TFs) control the process of neuronal subtype specification. Work in the
mouse has shown that the homeodomain (HD) TF Gsx2 plays essential roles in the patterning and differentiation of
neuronal cell types that arise from progenitors in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) of the embryonic mouse
telencephalon. These progenitors give rise to cell types that include the striatal projection neurons of the basal ganglia
and interneurons in the olfactory bulb, both of which are severely reduced in mouse Gsx2 mutants. Accordingly, human
patient studies identified 2 pathological GSX2 variant alleles in children with serious neurological symptoms, including
dystonia and intellectual disabilities. Consistent with these symptoms, MRI imaging revealed severe basal ganglia
agenesis. One GSX2 variant results in a null allele, however, the other is a missense variant (Q251R) that alters a key
amino acid in the DNA binding HD. We generated a mouse model of this human variant and our initial studies suggest
that the Q>R variant leads to a strong embryonic LGE and basal ganglia phenotype that is morphologically similar to
embryos with Gsx2 null alleles. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that this human HD variant alters Gsx2 DNA
binding specificity, and thereby may account for the observed phenotypes. Moreover, we recently determined that Gsx2
binds and regulates target genes via two mechanisms; as a monomer Gsx2 represses gene expression whereas on a subset
of DNA sites cooperative Gsx2 binding to dimer sites appears to facilitate gene expression. Intriguingly, the Dlx HD
TFs, which lie downstream of Gsx2 during LGE progenitor maturation, also bind monomer sites but instead of repressing
they activate gene expression. In this application, we propose to determine how Gsx2 and the Dlx TFs regulate LGE
gene expression during basal ganglia development. To achieve this goal, we will test the following hypotheses in 3
independent specific aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that Gsx2 controls basal ganglia development by mediating distinct
gene regulatory outcomes in a DNA binding site dependent manner. 2) To test the hypotheses that Gsx2 and Dlx TFs
regulate a common set of LGE genes though direct competition for shared enhancer elements. 3) To test the hypothesis
that the GSX2Q251R human variant causes altered DNA binding specificity, and thereby results in the mis-regulation of
LGE gene expression and ultimately basal ganglia agenesis. Our approach will combine the use of mouse genetics and
human forebrain neural stem cell cultures with molecular, biochemical, and genomic approaches to study transcriptional
control of neuronal specification in the developing basal ganglia. The unique expertise of our research team at CCHMC
allows us to take this broad approach, and thus increases our chances to gain a deeper understanding of how Gsx factors
control basal ganglia development as well as to uncover new gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie dysfunction in
certain childhood neurological disorders."
10765705,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysfunction in the stability of long-term memories is a core symptom of many neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Alzheimer’s disease, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The process by which
newly formed memories are stabilized into more permanent storage is known as memory consolidation. The
hippocampus (HPC) has a well-established role in the initial formation and storage of memory. Over the course
of days-to-months, memory recall is thought to become increasingly dependent on cortical regions, such as the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). How memory is reorganized at the systems level between HPC and ACC
remains poorly understood. Recent studies implicate an intermediate brain region, the entorhinal cortex (EC),
as facilitating consolidation of memories. Disrupting the EC impairs the ability of new memories to be stored over
long durations. However, it remains unclear when and how EC may contribute to memory consolidation. We
hypothesize that EC is recruited at the time of learning to stabilize neurons and neural ensembles in ACC that
represent a learned association. This project will test this by utilizing methods of monitoring and manipulating
the dynamics of brain-wide circuits over extended periods of time through three specific aims. In aim one, we
will first develop a novel virtual-reality based contextual learning task in head-fixed mice, allowing us to probe
the learning and recall of memories throughout the duration of consolidation (weeks-to-months). The EC-ACC
projection will be selectively inhibited at various time points to quantify its role in remote memory recall. In aim
2, we will record bulk neural activity from HPC, EC, and ACC using chronically implanted optical fibers (fiber
photometry) to track interregional interactions and the emergence of neural correlates of memory during memory
consolidation. In aim 3, we will perform two photon calcium imaging in ACC throughout memory retrieval
including recent and remote time points. The EC-ACC projection will be selectively inhibited and the effect of this
circuit on neural representations of memory at remote time points will be quantified. This investigation will fill a
substantial gap in our understanding of systems consolidation and facilitate new insights into the distributed
dynamics of memory in psychiatric health and disease. The applicant’s career goal is to be an academic
physician-scientist with a research program aimed at bridging the gap between basic systems neuroscience
research and clinical treatments. He is pursuing MD-PhD training at Weill Cornell Medical College and The
Rockefeller University, and will develop research, scientific communication, and clinical expertise skills during
this fellowship."

The long-term objective of the proposed Florida International University-Health Disparities Initiative (FIU-HDI)
is to enhance and expand FIU’s capacity for health disparities research and training. These efforts will have a
direct impact on reducing health disparities in communicable and noncommunicable health conditions in
vulnerable, underserved communities in South Florida and the Caribbean region. The proposed FIU-HDI will
advance foundational efforts of the original FIU-HDI (S21MD010683) and other health disparities programs
and centers at the University, including: FIU’s P20 Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on
Latinos in the United States (C-SALUD; P20MD002288); FIU’s U54 Center for Latino Health Research
Opportunities (CLaRO; #U54MD002266), which is a continuation of FIU’s P20 Center, and; FIU’s Emerging
Preeminent Health Inequities and Disparities Program. The proposed FIU-HDI will utilize community-engaged
multidisciplinary approaches to further strengthen the University’s capacity to train the next generation of public
health, clinical, biomedical, and behavioral researchers at FIU’s Robert Stempel College of Public Health &
Social Work (hereafter Stempel College) and Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine (hereafter HWCOM) to
address health disparities in communicable and noncommunicable heath conditions—and advance health
equity—among underserved populations in South Florida and the Caribbean. Thus, the three objectives of the
proposed FIU-HDI are: Objective 1: Expand the breadth and scope of FIU’s existing Health Disparities
Doctoral Concentration to include doctoral students across all departments/schools within Stempel College,
and doctoral students in Biomedical Sciences at HWCOM, enabling them to earn doctoral degrees in their
respective fields with a concentration in Health Disparities; Objective 2: Expand the FIU-HDI post-doctoral
training program allowing early stage investigators to receive training, mentoring, and professional
development opportunities in their chosen focus area with the goal of becoming independent health disparities
researchers; Objective 3: Expand and strengthen the HWCOM Research Scholarship Course by continuing
to train the next generation of physicians to understand the role of social and cultural determinants of health in
the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients in vulnerable and underserved communities. The proposed FIU-
HDI will build on the expertise available across Stempel College, whose faculty (a) possess extensive
experience in conducting NIH-funded community-engaged health disparities research with underserved
communities in South Florida; and (b) have cultivated and sustained ongoing community-based collaborations
with distinguished research institutions in the Caribbean. This application expands on the success of the
current program to establish a permanent investment by the University in continuing to build research and

10778010,"Project Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive desmoplasia, resulting in occupancy
of most of the tumor mass by a dense stroma consisting of fibroblasts, macrophages, and extracellular matrix
(ECM). Fibrillar collagens, such as type I collagen (Col I), are major ECM components and were reported to
exert poorly understood stimulatory and inhibitory effects on PDAC growth and malignancy. It was also observed
that patients whose stroma is fibrolytic, with a high content of cleaved collagen fragments generated by matrix
metalloproteases (MMP), show poor overall survival after resection, whereas patients with an inert stroma, rich
in intact collagen fibers, have considerably improved survival. The mechanisms underlying these clinical
observations and the tumor stimulatory or inhibitory effects of Col I were heretofore unknown. Using a unique
culture system, preclinical models, and clinical specimens, we discovered that intact (i) Col I fibers and MMP-
generated cleaved (c) Col I fragments have diametrically opposed effects on PDAC metabolism and growth due
to their differential interactions with the collagen receptor DDR1. Whereas cCol I (and other MMP-cleaved
collagens) activates DDR1 and its downstream effectors, which include transcription factors NF-kB and NRF2,
to stimulate PDAC metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and respiration, iCol I does not activate DDR1 and
instead induces its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting NRF2 activation and PDAC
metabolism. Our goal is to understand how MMP cleavage enables the binding of cCol I to DDR1 and determine
if binding to DDR1 is required for induction of its degradation by iCol I. To fully understand how cCol I and DDR1
signaling control PDAC metabolism and growth, and why Col I ablation is not as inhibitory as prevention of Col
I cleavage, we will test whether the differential effects of cCol I and iCol I on DDR1 expression and activation
apply to other fibrillary collagens (Col III) and define the underlying biochemical mechanisms that enable DDR1
binding. Next, we will investigate how iCol I triggers DDR1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and the
role of the newly uncovered DDR1 E3 ligase FBXW2 in this process. These studies will include identification of
the mechanism by which iCol I stimulates DDR1 ubiquitination by FBXW2 and development of ligase-recruiting
tool compounds that induce DDR1 degradation, whose biological effects will be evaluated in cultured cells and
mouse models. This will be followed by studying the role of individual MMP isozymes, expressed in PDAC cancer
cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and macrophages, in collagen remodeling and PDAC metabolism and
growth. We will determine the suitability of individual collagen cleaving MMPs as drug targets for the treatment
of cCol I enriched PDAC. We will also determine the mechanisms responsible for MMP induction in the PDAC
microenvironment, as they may provide additional therapeutic targets. The proposed studies will employ cutting-
edge technologies, innovative ECM based PDAC cultures, new genetically modified mouse strains that allow the
evaluation of both primary and liver metastatic PDAC and clinical specimens."
10778099,"Project Summary
The excessive accumulation of cholesterol in vascular macrophages is regarded as a leading factor in the
development of vascular inflammation, plaque instability and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. However,
recent advances in single cell analyses and our studies suggest that inflammatory genes are predominantly
expressed in macrophages that accumulate cholesterol in the plasma membrane rather than in lipid droplet-
laden macrophage foam cells. Cholesterol and many receptors governing inflammatory responses colocalize in
the ordered plasma membrane microdomains, often designated as lipid rafts. Upon activation, lipid raft resident
and recruited proteins assemble and initiate signaling cascades leading to inflammation. We introduced the term
inflammarafts, defined as enlarged, clustered lipid rafts harboring activated receptors and adaptor molecules
and serving as a scaffold to organize cellular inflammatory responses. We found inflammarafts to be surprisingly
stable in macrophages isolated from atherosclerotic lesions. We further identified apoA-I binding protein (AIBP)
as a key regulator of cellular cholesterol metabolism, which can selectively target inflammarafts via its binding to
TLR4, without disrupting physiological lipid rafts. In preliminary studies, we found that non-foamy macrophages
but not macrophage foam cells expressed inflammarafts, which correlated with atherosclerosis burden. In
addition, hypercholesterolemic AIBP deficient mice, which we created, developed exacerbated atherosclerosis.
In contrast, the AAV-mediated expression of a secreted form of AIBP in the liver reduced atherosclerosis. In
addition, mitochondria in AIBP-deficient cells were morphologically distorted, with a characteristic hyper-
branched and cupped shape, typically associated with oxidative stress. The goal of this proposal is to delineate
mechanisms governing differential inflammaraft dynamics and related mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophage
foam cells and in non-foamy macrophages in atherosclerosis. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that
reversal of inflammarafts in non-foamy macrophages reduces vascular inflammation and is atheroprotective.
The hypothesis will be tested using genetic and AAV tools to achieve constitutive, macrophage-specific and/or
inducible loss-of-function or gain-of function of cholesterol transporters ABCA1/G1 and/or AIBP and its variant
that does not bind TLR4. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that AIBP protects macrophages from
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in atherosclerosis. We will examine mitochondrial architecture
and function in macrophages with loss- and gain-of-function of different forms of AIBP and/or ABCA1/G1.
Methods will include serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (EM) and multi-tilt EM tomography, along
with measures of bioenergetics by Seahorse. To assess the relevance of our hypotheses and the findings to
human cardiovascular disease, we will characterize macrophage inflammarafts and mitochondrial dysfunction in
coronary arteries from explanted hearts of patients with heart failure due to atherosclerotic coronary artery
disease or due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, which undergo heart transplant surgery."
10861911,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
My career goal is to lead an interdisciplinary team that investigates the developmental neurocomputational
mechanisms that link early-life adversity to mental health. To reach this goal, I require intensive training in
human neuroimaging methods, cognitive computational neuroscience, and dyadic methodologies. My training
to date has provided a strong foundation of skills in developmental neuroscience, early-life adversity, statistical
modeling, experience sampling, and machine learning. I identified the best possible mentorship team and
scientific environment to support me in expanding this skill set with essential training in emotional memory,
fMRI analysis, computational modeling, real-world dyadic (parent-child) behavior methods, and professional
skills. With this protected training time, I will be poised to successfully transition to a competitive postdoctoral
position and ultimately obtain a tenure-track faculty position at the forefront of developmental neuroscience.
Research: More than one-third of children experience early caregiving adversity such as abuse, neglect, and
parental abandonment/separation, which accounts for the onset of at least 30-45% of mental health disorders
world-wide. Clinical association studies show that this increased risk for psychopathology is linked to
perturbations in midline cortico-subcortical circuitry, comprised of the midcingulo-insular “salience” network and
posterior-medial “default mode” network. At the same time, experimental studies in cognitive neuroscience find
that this circuitry has a broader functional role in semantic social and affective knowledge. Might the neural
alterations that give rise to psychopathology risk following early caregiving adversity be one and the same as
the neurobiology found to represent learned affective semantic memories? In line with my preliminary data, I
will test the hypothesis that alterations in midline cortico-subcortical circuitry following early adversity represent
the affective semantic knowledge learned during early caregiving experiences. During the F99-phase, I will
identify the midline cortico-subcortical activity patterns associated with children’s affective semantic memories
during fMRI in a developmental sample enriched for early caregiving adversity (Aim 1.1), and then examine the
links between affective semantic neural representations and real-world parent-child emotional behaviors using
dyadic ecological momentary assessments (Aim 1.2). In the K00-phase, I will determine whether Bayesian
predictive coding in midline cortico-subcortical circuitry explains the neural computations underlying affective
semantic memory in childhood and examine how these neurocomputational mechanisms differ as a function of
age, socioemotional context, and early adversity exposure (Aim 2). This research will result in more powerful,
ecologically-sensitive computational models of human development through the integration of cutting-edge
approaches to neurocomputation, real-time parent-child behavior, and affective semantic memory. Such
advances have the potential to significantly extend neurodevelopmental models of psychopathology, which is
essential for developing interventions tailored to age, early experience, and neurocomputational mechanism."

EBV(+) lymphomas are an important cause of death in people living with HIV (PLWH). Different patterns of viral
and cellular gene expression have been found to characterize different subtypes of EBV(+) lymphomas. CpG
methylation of EBV DNA is an important epigenetic regulator of viral and cellular gene expression. At present,
we have a very limited understanding of CpG methylation in EBV(+) lymphomas in PLWH, and how this may
determine patterns of viral gene expression. Although we are very successful in treating some EBV(+) lymphoma
in HIV patients, many cases are diagnosed very late after organ function has been compromised, or only on
post-mortem exam. This is especially true in populations with limited access to health care in the US, as well as
in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with high HIV prevalence. Assessment of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in
plasma is increasingly recognized as useful in early cancer detection. Plasma cell-free EBV DNA has been
shown to be useful in screening for nasopharyngeal cancer. However, high levels of EBV DNA in some PLWH
reduce the specificity of EBV DNA quantitation as a diagnostic maker of lymphoma. Evidence is emerging that
EBV CpG methylation, or patterns of methylation, could accurately identify EBV(+) malignancies. The proposed
studies should improve the collective understanding of epigenetic modification of EBV and viral and cellular gene
expression, and enable discovery of novel EBV liquid biopsy diagnostics for early cancer detection in PLWH. In
aim 1, we will characterize lymphoma transcriptomes by RNA-Seq and EBV methylomes by high throughput
bisulfite sequencing (bs-Seq) to investigate the relationship between the cellular and viral transcriptome and
EBV methylation. In aim 2, we will systematically investigate the plasma EBV DNA methylome in PLWH with
EBV(+) lymphoma and PLWH controls so as to identify differentially methylated regions of the viral genome that
are most informative for lymphoma. These results will guide design and evaluation of methylation-specific PCR
primer sets that can enable rapid assessment of EBV methylation states. The results from the qMSP studies will
be used to develop and train an automated qMSP classifier for the presence of EBV(+) lymphoma. In aim 3, we
propose to establish a new plasma (and saliva) specimen collection from PLWH with EBV(+) lymphoma and
matched controls. We will validate the plasma classifier developed in this independent cohort. We will also apply
this qMSP classifier to saliva to explore the possibility that saliva cfDNA may be a useful surrogate for plasma
cfDNA. At the conclusion of our studies, we anticipate having an improved understanding of the interplay
between lymphoma gene expression, EBV gene expression and EBV CpG methylation. Our results will aid in
the development of the first plasma EBV qMSP PCR assay for EBV(+) lymphoma in PLWH, and will enable
exploration of saliva as an alternate source for cfDNA for future liquid biopsy applications in PLWH. We anticipate
that our findings will pave the way for the development of point of care multiplex PCR assay systems appropriate
for future investigations of low-cost screening assays in the US and in LMICs.

Children under 5 years of age account for ~50% of the 1.2 million new cases of pediatric TB each year, but are
least likely to be diagnosed, and are at highest risk of death without prompt treatment. Young children are more
likely to present with disseminated or extrapulmonary TB and paucibacillary disease, often missed by respiratory
sampling and our currently available diagnostics. Non-sputum diagnostic tools for TB detection and treatment
response in young children, using easily obtained specimens are urgently needed.
Our team has successfully developed an ultra-sensitive CRISPR-based approach (CRISPR-TB) that detects M.
tuberculosis (Mtb) cell free DNA (cfDNA). In pilot evaluation with repository blood samples, CRISPR-TB
demonstrated high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (95%) among adults and children with TB and their
asymptomatic household contacts in Eswatini. Among hospitalized Kenyan children with HIV (median age 2
years), CRISPR-TB detected 100% with microbiologically confirmed TB, and an additional 85% with clinically
diagnosed TB (i.e. missed by respiratory-based diagnostics).
We now propose to expand CRISPR-TB evaluation in a large prospective cohort of 400 children with suspected
TB (majority <5 years) to evaluate CRISPR-TB diagnostic performance (Aim 1) including longitudinal evaluation
for treatment response (Aim 2), and extend evaluation to urine samples (Aim 3). Additional cohorts of adults with
confirmed TB and their asymptomatic household controls, and recently BCG-immunized asymptomatic infants
will be evaluated. Exploratory aims will pilot a POC platform, assess utility of CRISPR-TB to identify early
incipient or subclinical disease in participants with missed diagnosis at baseline who develop incident TB, and
estimate “true” prevalence of pediatric TB using Bayesian latent class analysis given imperfect reference tests.
We hypothesize CRISPR-TB will have similar/improved diagnostic performance to Xpert on respiratory samples
among children with confirmed TB without the need for sputum, and identify additional children missed by
respiratory samples, will provide a useful surrogate marker of treatment response with decline in quantitative
levels during successful treatment, and be adaptable to urine samples."

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) including Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are among the most
difficult to treat etiological agents associated with pulmonary disease. Just between 2008-2015, the annual NTM
lung disease incidence increased from 3.13% to 4.73% per 100,000 persons, and the annual prevalence
changed from 6.78% to 11.7%. The current American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend a macrolide-
ethambutol-rifamycin combination therapy for treatment of pulmonary MAC, where therapy continues for 12-
months after converting one’s sputum culture to negative (no growth or microbiological clearance). We performed
a meta-analysis and found that despite an average 18–23-month long therapy duration, the sustained sputum
culture conversion rates at the end of therapy were only 54% with the macrolide containing regimen and 32%
with macrolide-free regimens. Thus, there is need for safe, more effective, and shorter-course regimens for
treatment of MAC pulmonary disease. However, there is a knowledge gap in the
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics-based guidelines on dose and combination regimen composition as well
as information on the synergy/antagonism between the drugs, at the given dose, in the combination. As a result,
the treatment regimen for MAC infections is largely empirical and driven by clinical experience. To fill in the
knowledge gap, we devised a programmatic approach for unbiased screening of the drugs (old, new, and/or
repurposed) for efficacy against MAC to perform dose selection using the principle of
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. We use a pre-clinical hollow fiber system model of MAC (HFS-MAC) in
tandem with a mouse model of MAC, clinical trial simulations, and time-to-extinction modeling using pre-clinical
and clinical data to design and rank efficacious combinations of drugs for MAC killing and accurate estimates of
therapeutic duration. The safety and toxicity profile of the drugs we propose to advance, in this grant proposal,
for treatment of MAC pulmonary disease is well documented, data on human population pharmacokinetics are
available, and the mechanism of action and the effective tissue penetration are also available for most of the
proposed drugs. Thus, exposure targets for maximal kill, identified in the pre-clinical models can be translated
to a clinical dose to treat patients with MAC pulmonary disease in a relatively shorter timeframe. We aim to
shorten the therapy duration for pulmonary MAC from the current >18 months to <6 months."
10776616,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BRAF activating mutations occur in approximately 10% of metastatic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and are
associated with worse prognosis due to an inferior response to standard chemotherapies. Current standard of
care for patients with metastatic BRAFV600E CRC who have received prior therapy is BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) plus
EGFRi treatment. Unfortunately, responses are not durable and the median overall survival of patients receiving
combination therapy remains dismal at roughly 9 months. Therefore, improving response to BRAFi plus EGFRi
therapy in metastatic BRAF mutant CRC represents a critical unmet clinical need. With the use of more potent
targeted therapies, shifts in cell identity due to epithelial cell transdifferentiation is an emerging cause of therapy
resistance. In a subset of lung and prostate cancers, lineage transition from adenocarcinoma to a
neuroendocrine phenotype is a mechanism of resistance to EGFRi and anti-androgen targeted therapies,
respectively. However, the phenomenon of “therapy-induced transdifferentiation” has not been examined in
CRC. It was recently determined that BRAF mutant CRC uniquely contains enteroendocrine cell (EEC)
progenitors that promote cancer cell survival via secreted factors and that the differentiation state of these tumors
is regulated by the lysine demethylase LSD1. In new preliminary studies, BRAFi alone or in combination with
EGFRi is shown to further increase the number of EEC progenitors in BRAF mutant CRC. BRAFi treatment is
also found to induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to interact with LSD1 resulting in
EEC progenitor enrichment. Consequently, inhibition or knockdown of either STAT3 or LSD1 blocks BRAFi-
induced enrichment of EEC progenitors. EECs are intestinal neuroendocrine cells and the finding that this
population expands after BRAFi provides strong scientific premise for the overall hypothesis that this lineage
promotes therapy resistance in BRAF mutant CRC. It is hypothesized that BRAFi promotes therapy resistance
by transdifferentiation of BRAF mutant CRCs to an EEC progenitor state through STAT3 and LSD1 activation. It
is further hypothesized that inhibiting LSD1 is a promising strategy to block BRAFi-induced transdifferentiation
and to improve the durability of tumor control with BRAFi plus EGFRi treatment. In Aim 1, the mechanism by
which BRAFi promotes transdifferentiation in BRAF mutant CRC will be determined by focusing on how LSD1
and STAT3 interact to regulate downstream gene expression pathways. In Aim 2, a clinically relevant LSD1
inhibitor will be used in a syngeneic mouse model of metastatic BRAF mutant CRC and human PDX models to
determine the effect of LSD1 inhibition on BRAFi plus EGFRi-induced transdifferentiation, the tumor immune
microenvironment, and efficacy of targeted therapy in vivo. Overall, the proposed work has the potential to
develop an epigenetic inhibitor-based approach to block therapy-induced transdifferentiation, prolong therapy
response, and improve clinical outcomes for patients with BRAF mutant CRC."
10847529,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epigenetics machinery has been used as important therapeutic drug targets evident by the
successful inhibitors for cancer treatment. Although the malaria parasite harbors many epigenetic
regulators, it remains a great challenge to discover unique ones diverse from those in the human
host. Based on previous studies and our recent preliminary data, PfSET7, one of ten SET-domain
containing lysine (K) methyltransferases (KMTs) in Plasmodium falciparum, is discovered to be a
Plasmodium-specific KMT with unique structures and functions. PfSET7 does not belong to any
known SET family in model organisms because it contains a unique motif II in the SET domain.
PfSET7 was found localized at the apical tip of merozoite and downregulation of PfSET7 by ~35%
using our newly developed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) resulted in defects in merozoite
egress and invasion, reminiscent of the findings that Toxoplasma gondii apical complex KMT
(TgAKMT) is also localized at the apical tip before egress and disruption of TgAKMT led to defects
in parasite egress and invasion due to impaired motility. However, TgAKMT’s mode of action,
especially its substrates, is still unknown. Remarkably, PfSET7 was found also localized in the
gametocyte cytoplasm and nucleus, and downregulation of PfSET7 by ~26% also led to defects
in gametocyte development, coincidentally with the findings that PfSET7 has peak expression in
gametocytes and many distinct methylated lysines were identified in gametocyte histones.
Notably, PfSET7 contains four Plasmodium-specific regions and is only ~41% identical to
TgAKMT, indicating PfSET7 harbors malaria-specific structures. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that PfSET7 is a Plasmodium-specific KMT and has a dual function in the regulation
of gametocyte gene expression and merozoite motility during egress/invasion by targeting histone
and non-histone proteins, respectively. To decipher the critical function and substrate specificity
of PfSET7, we will apply advanced new technologies including a stronger CRISPRi KD with
optimized gRNAs and a conditional knockout for gene functional study, and quantitative
methylome for substrate identification. It is anticipated that this study will lay a solid foundation for
understanding PfSET7’s mechanism of action and the development of novel apicomplexan-
specific epigenetic drugs."
10741299,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The proposed study is significant because we aim to understand the cellular mechanisms that regulate
lymph node (LN) maintenance in aging. Aging causes LN atrophy and fibrosis and is associated with impaired
immune responses. However, although the morphological changes that occur in aged LNs have been well
studied, the molecular mechanisms that cause these changes are poorly understood. This gap in knowledge
is important because LNs play a key role in orchestrating immune responses. Therefore, our studies will help
uncover therapies that may improve immune function in elderly men and women.
 Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are the building blocks of the lymphatic system and, as a network of
lymphatic vessels, transport of interstitial fluid and antigens to regional LNs. LECs are also a component of the
LN stroma and regulate LN organogenesis during development and LN hypertrophy in response to inflammatory
conditions. These regulatory pathways are coordinated by canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor kappa-
light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) signaling in LECs.
 Aging is known to impair lymphatic function and transport of interstitial fluid/antigens to the LN, and we
have shown in preliminary studies that LN LEC heterogeneity is altered in aged LNs and the expression of NFkB
by LN stromal LEC is decreased in aging animals. We also have found that deleting canonical NFkB-Rel-A
signaling in LECRel-A-/- mice results in significant LN atrophy and cellularity that is a phenocopy of the aging LN.
Based on this rationale, our central hypothesis is that decreased lymphatic function in aging results in
diminished expression of NFkB by LN stromal LECs, impaired production of lymphocyte survival signals, and
aging-related LN atrophy.
 Our study is innovative because we plan to conduct single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of LN stromal
LECs, and we have developed inducible transgenic Cre-lox mice in which we can selectively decrease LEC
NFκB signaling in adult animals. This model system enables us to directly study the role of LEC NFκB expression
in LN maintenance and atrophy. These transgenic mice, combined with our LN transplantation, and in vitro 3D
models, will also enable us to selectively analyze changes in LN LEC NFκB signaling and understand how these
populations contribute to adult LN homeostasis using two Specific Aims: (1) Determine the effects of aging on
LN LECs and effect of lymphatic flow on LEC NFkB expression and (2) determine how LEC NFκB
signaling regulates LN homeostasis in adult mice.
 At the conclusion of the proposed study, we expect to understand the cellular mechanisms that contribute
to aging-related LN atrophy and adult LN homeostasis. This understanding will provide the basis for future
studies designed to prevent or reverse aging-related LN atrophy."

A recent study showed that there were ~4.95 million deaths associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) in 2019 which included ~1.27 million deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. Klebsiella pneumoniae, which
commonly causes pneumonia and sepsis in hospitalized, immunosuppressed, and chronically ill patients, was
responsible for 17.5% of the deaths associated with AMR and 19.9% of the deaths attributable to AMR. Due to
the dwindling antibiotic pipeline, other approaches to target these infections are needed. We propose to develop
K. pneumoniae vaccines to prevent these infections from occurring, thereby reducing the need for antimicrobial
therapy and interrupting pathogen transmission. Here, we describe development of a live attenuated K.
pneumoniae vaccine with excellent safety and tolerability while maintaining immunogenicity. The main goal of
the current application is to show that we can develop live oral K. pneumoniae vaccines with excellent safety
due to reduced potential for transmission, designated here as Live Attenuated Non-Transmissible (LANT)
vaccines. To achieve this goal, we will genetically engineer a live attenuated K. pneumoniae candidate vaccine
in which arabinose-controlled synthesis of the essential single stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) strictly limits
post-vaccination replication. We will also determine whether we can achieve broad protection mediated by
subcapsular antigens. We will complete pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies assessing the in vivo persistence,
immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of candidate K. pneumoniae LANT vaccines in mice. At the conclusion
of this project, we anticipate demonstrating that an optimized K. pneumoniae LANT vaccine stops replicating in
the absence of arabinose in vitro as well as in vivo but is still immunogenic and can protect animals against
challenge with wild-type K. pneumoniae. If we are successful, these results will pave the way for development
of a broadly protective, safe and immunogenic K. pneumoniae vaccine."

A molecular pathway that links N-glycosylation to birth defects
Developmental defects are the leading cause of both fetal loss before birth and infant deaths after birth. The
immense advances in our genetic understanding of mammalian development over the past four decades have
not yet translated into better preventative or therapeutic options for babies with birth defects. Our ability to
address this high unmet need depends critically on the discovery and detailed mechanistic understanding of
molecular and cellular pathways that drive human developmental defects. Working with a multidisciplinary
investigative team that combines expertise in signal transduction, human genetics and bone biology, we have
discovered an novel inter-organelle communication mechanism that links protein N-glycosylation in the
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to the reception of WNT signals at the cell surface. The WNT/β-catenin pathway
is a key cell-cell communication system that regulates tissue patterning during development and regenerative
responses in adults. Human genetic studies from our collaborators show that this ER-based pathway is
disrupted in a severe, deforming subtype of the inherited bone fragility disorder Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)
and in subtypes of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), characterized by developmental defects
across tissues. Given that over 25% of proteins encoded in our genomes are N-glycosylated, we propose the
existence of a surveillance mechanism (analogous to the unfolded protein response) that ensures WNT-driven
differentiation is only allowed to proceed if the ER N-glycosylation machinery is intact. The three goals of this
proposal are to delineate the components and transduction mechanisms of this regulated N-glycosylation
pathway, understand its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix production and establish its relevance
to human birth defect syndromes. We use genome-wide CRISPR screens and mass spectrometry to identify
pathway components, gene-editing to disrupt or mutate these components in both cell lines and primary cells
from human OI patients, and mechanistic studies to understand how N-glycosylation in the ER tunes WNT
ligand sensitivity at the cell surface. Successful completion of this project will define a new pathway that
regulates WNT signaling and human development by using N-glycosylation as a regulatory post-translational
modification. More broadly, our work will define a largely unexplored signaling function for N-glycosylation, a
fundamental cell biological process linked to diseases across multiple organ systems."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and effective treatment of castration-
resistant PCa (CRPC) remains the major challenge in clinic. SPOP is a substrate-binding adaptor of the
CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and the SPOP gene is mutated in 10-15% of primary and non-
castrate metastatic PCa. Notably, approximately 50% of SPOP-mutated PCa remain resistant to androgen
receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors such as enzalutamide (Enza) and therefore there is an urgent need to elucidate
the underlying mechanism of resistance and devise new treatment strategies. Our preliminary studies
demonstrated that SPOP mutation (SPOPmut) co-occurred with aberrant activation of the MAPK pathway
(MAPKalt) such as genomic alterations in the components of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis and that two
lesions cooperated to induce prostate oncogenesis and progression in mice. We found that SPOPmut/MAPKalt
PCa cells are castration-resistant in culture and in mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that SPOP mutation
induced stabilization of GLP and G9a proteins and augmented MAPKalt-induced expression of DNA
methyltransferase DNMT1, thereby promoting DNA hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of a group of
tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including AR-interacting proteins such as KDM6A. We confirmed
hypermethylation in KDM6A gene locus and its downregulation in TCGA and SU2C PCa patient samples and in
cultured PCa cells with high-level ERK1/2 phosphorylation (MAPKalt). We further showed that KDM6A interacts
with AR and that SPOP mutation increases AR protein methylation in a manner dependent on KDM6A. We
showed that co-treatment with MEK inhibitor re-sensitized SPOPmut/MAPKalt PCa cells to Enza. Based on these
novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that SPOP mutation cooperates with aberrantly activated MAPK pathway
to induce aberrant GLP/G9a protein stabilization and DNMT1 upregulation, which in turn promote DNA
hypermethylation at the loci of TSGs such as KDM6A, increased AR protein methylation, AR signaling
reprograming, and castration-resistant progression of PCa, thereby representing a viable target to overcome the
antiandrogen resistance in SPOPmut/MAPKalt PCa. We will determine the molecular mechanism and extent to
which KDM6A regulates AR protein demethylation and AR activities in SPOPmut/MAPKalt PCa cells (Aim 1),
determine molecular mechanism underlying the deregulations of the GLP/G9a/DNMT1-KDM6A axis and their
impact on castration-resistant growth of SPOPmut/MAPKalt PCa cells (Aim 2), and determine the mechanism,
disease relevance and preclinical therapeutic targeting of functional cooperation between SPOP mutation and
aberrant activation of the MAPK pathway in PCa (Aim 3). Findings from this innovative proposal will not only
shed new light on our understanding of the tumor biology of SPOP mutations and molecular mechanisms of
antiandrogen therapy resistance in SPOP mutated PCa, but also lead to identification of new therapeutic targets
or strategies for effective treatment of PCa, thereby influencing the PCa field both scientifically and clinically."
10774240,"People with diabetes are more likely to have cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney disease. The majority of
the excess risk of CVD in diabetes is restricted to patients with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
New data indicates that apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) plays a critical role in diabetic atherosclerosis and
preliminary data suggests that it is causally linked to DKD. APOC3 is a key regulator of triglyceride-rich
lipoprotein (TLR) metabolism. It is in turn regulated by insulin, but also by kidney disease. Our overall
hypothesis is that diabetes and kidney disease raise APOC3 levels. Increased levels of TRLs and their
remnants, driven by APOC3, accelerate diabetic kidney disease as well as atherosclerosis. This hypothesis will
be tested in 2 separate aims: Aim 1: Does blocking APOC3 prevent diabetic kidney disease? This will be
tested in 2 different mouse models of diabetes and kidney disease using 2 different approaches to target
APOC3; a specific antisense (ASO) to APCO3 and a transcription factor (CREBH) that has profound effects
selectively on TLR-associated APOC3. Aim 2: Does renal impairment and diabetes act synergistically to
elevate APOC3, contributing atherosclerosis? To test the hypothesis that diabetes and reduced renal function
act synergistically to elevate plasma APOC3 to accelerate atherosclerosis we will induce renal impairment in
non-diabetic and diabetic mice using 5/6 nephrectomy. APOC3 levels will be reduced in these mice using both
APOC3 ASO treatment and hepatic overexpression of CREBH to test the causal role of APOC3. The majority
of the excessive CVD risk in diabetes is present in patients who also have DKD. With the diabetic population
growing, finding new therapeutic targets is exceedingly important. We propose a novel common mechanism
whereby DKD and CVD are accelerated by APOC3-mediated increases in TRLs and their remnants, and a
new way that both can be prevented by blocking APOC3. These studies are likely to reveal important
similarities in the mechanisms whereby APOC3 promotes two of the major complications of diabetes. A human
APOC3 ASO has already been tested in T2DM patients with promising TRL-lowering results, thus APOC3
might be a therapeutic target for combating the rising epidemic of diabetic complications."

Despite the important role of the tumor stroma in cancer progression, the vast majority of anticancer therapies
target cancer cells and not the tumor microenvironment. A novel drug delivery approach that not only target
tumor cells but also the inflammatory cells would be highly desirable. Here we propose to develop a delivery
platform that builds on our recent work designing single chain variable fragment antibodies that both inhibit
inflammatory monocyte migration to tumors and polarize macrophages towards the tumoricidal M1 phenotype
by hijacking the CCL2/CCR2 pathway. This approach capitalizes on antibody binding specificity but exploits
CCR2 receptor structure and function to improve therapeutic efficacy. We hypothesize that simultaneous
targeting of multiple CCR2 epitopes will mediate a synergistic drug effect and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis
by inducing M1 macrophage polarization and reducing macrophage migration. Our protein delivery approach
capitalizes on both the targeting specificity of antibody fragments and also their ability to induce or modify
downstream signaling. Thus, the antibody fragments will serve both as a delivery vehicle and therapeutic drug
and have the potential to minimize carrier-induced toxicity. The specific aims of this proposal are to (1) synthesize
a modular CCR2-targeting zip-ligand system for macrophage polarization and establish its mechanism of action;
(2) assess the effects of multi-epitope CCR2-targeting constructs on macrophage polarization, tumor growth,
and metastasis in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model; and (3) evaluate the therapeutic effects
of multi-epitope CCR2 targeting in combination with (a) anti-PD-1 blockade and (b) other therapeutics in a mouse
model of TNBC, a subtype with particularly poor clinical outcomes and limited treatment options. Upon successful
completion, this project will establish a new delivery concept to modify downstream signaling and modulate
cellular phenotypes."
10756501,"Project Summary
The work described in this proposal aims to develop novel synthetic methods enabled by excited-state redox
events to address longstanding challenges in catalysis and synthetic organic chemistry. A primary focus of this
proposal is the continued development of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) technologies in organic
synthesis. In particular we focus on developing PCET-based methods for the catalytic functionalization of
aliphatic C-C bonds, including redox-neutral isomerization reactions of cyclic alcohols to form linear carbonyl
compounds, and novel methods for the catalytic ring-expansion and ring-contraction of carbocyclic alcohols.
We also discuss efforts to develop a new class of chiral amide-based catalysts that can be activated by PCET
to generate transient amidyls, which can then mediate enantioselective and site-selective functionalization of
aliphatic C-H bonds. A second goal of this work is the development of out-of-equilibrium synthetic methods
enabled by excited-state redox events. These technologies provide opportunities to use photon absorption
events to drive reaction against a thermochemical gradient, but without requiring generation of excited state
substrates. Importantly, these methods provide novel approaches to achieve non-Boltzmann product
distributions and reaction outcomes that are not, by definition, possible to obtain using conventional ground-
state methods. Applications to the development of light-driven deracemization reactions are presented. A third
goal is to advance our efforts in developing photocatalytic methods for olefin hydroamination and
hydroetherification. We propose to develop the first general catalytic protocol for intermolecular anti-
Markovnikov hydroamination reactions between unactivated olefins with primary alkyl amines to yield
secondary amine products, selectively, based on the chemistry of aminium radical cations. PCET-based
methods for enantioselective hydroaminations with sulfonamides are also proposed, wherein the asymmetric
induction is proposed to arise from direct non-covalent interactions between a chiral H-bond donor and a
neutral N-centered radical intermediate. We also present plans to develop analogous intermolecular
hydroetherification methods and their enantioselective variants. If successful, these efforts will provide valuable
new reactions and concepts for the chemistry communities engaged in the discovery, synthesis, and
manufacture of pharmaceuticals and other small-molecule probes of biological function, and thus create a
significant benefit to human health."
10756503,"Metazoan tissues are diverse in organization and function. This necessitates diverse mechanisms to
repair these tissues upon injury. We pioneered study of the Drosophila hindgut (large intestine) to reveal new
tissue injury regulation. Using this model, we identified an injury response whereby tissue mass is restored by
increasing the DNA content (ploidy) and size of cells that survive injury. This increase in ploidy involves a
conserved cell cycle with S phases but no cell division, called the endocycle. Our discovery of endocycles and
polyploid cells in tissue repair has been followed by similar discoveries in multiple injured mammalian tissues,
including the kidney, bladder, and cornea. Additionally, our work revealed specialized polyploid cell regulation at
the injured boundary between the hindgut and adjacent midgut (small intestine). At this boundary, we identified
“hybrid” cells of dual hindgut and midgut gene expression. Hybrid cells become polyploid upon injury while
engaging in extensive cross-talk with stem cells in the adjacent midgut. However, if the hybrid zone is severely
injured, polyploidy is suppressed, and the adjacent midgut stem cells form hyperplastic invasive tumors. Similar
hybrid zones have now been discovered at mammalian organ boundaries, notably at the stem cell-enriched,
cancer-prone stomach/esophagus boundary.
 This proposal leverages our expertise, new findings, and the genetically amenable Drosophila model to
identify regulation and function of polyploidy after tissue injury. The significance of our proposed work is evident
in the conservation of the injury response, the conservation of endocycles in injury, and the conservation of the
molecules we study, including JAK/STAT signaling, Dichaete/SoxB1, and fizzy-related/cdh1. Our studies are
innovative because they show that tissues can regenerate by accurately controlling polyploid genome number,
that hormonal signaling and Sox transcription cooperate to control injury-induced polyploidy, and that a
regenerating polyploid organ boundary can suppress tumorigenesis. In Aim1, we will uncover how injury severity
determines the extent of polyploidy during regeneration. To answer this question, we will identify quantitative
parameters of JAK/STAT signaling at different injury strengths and identify specific pathway steps that coordinate
injury level with endocycle number. Aim2 will identify the molecular mechanism by which endocycles occur after
injury instead of mitosis. To answer this question, we will examine how Dichaete, a member of the conserved
Sox transcription factor family, cooperates with hormone signaling to promote a switch from injury-induced mitotic
cycles to endocycles. Aim3 will determine the origin and function of polyploid hybrid cells following injury. To
answer this question, we will distinguish between stem cell-dependent and stem cell-independent models of
organ boundary regeneration. Additionally, this aim will reveal the role of the hybrid zone and polyploidy in
repressing stem cell tumor invasion. All three aims capitalize on transcriptomic data and our unique precision
injury/genetics system to identify novel molecular players in an evolutionarily conserved tissue repair response."

Our long-term objective is to find ways to control methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here we
focus on characterizing how community-acquired (CA)-MRSA colonizes the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A key, but
underappreciated, observation is that GI colonization establishes a reservoir for transmission and is the most
common origin for CA-MRSA infection in infants and young children, who are at greater risk of infection than
adults. We and others have used murine models to identify S. aureus traits that support GI colonization. However,
the mechanisms governing GI colonization relevant to CA-MRSA are poorly understood, in part due to the use
of animal models that rely on antibiotic depletion of gut microbiota to establish colonization. Our recent published
and unpublished work adapted an infant mouse model to provide a tractable system relevant to CA-MRSA GI
colonization in the community, especially among infants and children. Our preliminary data, obtained using this
model, show that weaning is associated with colonization resistance to CA-MRSA. We also show that pore-
forming leukotoxins (“toxins”) promote CA-MRSA colonization in weaned mice, but had no effect in infant mice
or germ-free adult mice. Given our finding that weaning was associated with colonization resistance to CA-
MRSA, a property thought to be conferred by commensal microbiota, we hypothesize that perturbation of
commensal bacteria by toxins empowers CA-MRSA to overcome colonization resistance by commensal
bacteria. We also established that colonization resistance against CA-MRSA is paradoxically increased in mice
that lack adaptive immunity (B and T cells). Given that innate immune cells that shape the gut microbiota during
weaning and confer resistance to pathogens are upregulated in such mice, we secondarily hypothesize that
innate immunity and the microbiota combine to inhibit CA-MRSA colonization. To test our hypotheses, we will 1)
identify commensal species that mediate CA-MRSA colonization resistance in the gut, 2) understand the immune
mechanisms that inhibit the CA-MRSA colonization in mice without adaptive immunity, and 3) determine the
specific CA-MRSA toxins and interactions between S. aureus and gut commensals that affect bacterial
competition. The outcomes of these studies promise to identify bacterial taxa, innate immune mechanisms, and
CA-MRSA loci we might manipulate to perturb CA-MRSA colonization. The results will guide future efforts to
identify microbiota and cell-type-specific targets for rationally designed therapeutic strategies that modulate
colonization. To the extent that the work identifies virulence factors that contribute directly to pathogen
transmission, our work will also uncover bacterial mechanisms that could be exploited as targets for dual-action
therapeutics."

Sepsis is now the leading cause of death in US hospitals and there are currently no effective
pharmacological treatments for sepsis. Stromal cell-based therapies have shown efficacy in treating sepsis
in experimental models and have been approved for use in multiple countries for various immune
dysregulation diseases. Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are a subpopulation of stromal cells existing in all
lymphoid organs including fat associated lymphoid cluster (FALC) in adipose tissue. We have shown that
TLR9 signaling suppresses chemokine production in FRCs. Adoptive transfer of Tlr9-deficient FRCs
decreased mortality, bacterial load, and systemic inflammation compared with wild type (WT) FRCs after
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Here, we identified two distinct subsets of FRCs (Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo) in
mesenteric FALCs at baseline and after CLP. Importantly, the Ly6Chi FRC subset express similar top
marker genes as the CD55+ stromal cell subset that was previously described in both mouse and human
subcutaneous adipose tissue. Ly6Chi FRCs are enriched in the innate immune response-related genes after
CLP, whereas Ly6Clo FRCs are enriched in the humoral immune response-related genes. Furthermore, we
found that both Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo FRCs from Tlr9-/- mice increased gene expression associated with
inflammation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling compared with WT FRCs at baseline and
after CLP. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that TLR9 plays critical roles in regulating the biology of
distinct FRC subsets, and that modulation of TLR9 signaling in a subset-specific manner may improve the
efficacy of FRC-based therapy in sepsis. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: Aim 1:
To determine the mechanisms of TLR9-mediated regulation of FRC biology in mouse and human adipose
FRC subsets. We will take advantage of single cell technologies (single cell RNA-sequencing and Mass
cytometry) combined with the FRC-specific Tlr9-/- mice to determine the role of TLR9 in gene expression,
cell fate, and immunoregulatory functions in individual FRC subset in vivo and in vitro. We will also validate
the findings from mouse FRCs in human adipose FRCs. Aim 2: To determine the impact of TLR9 inhibition
preconditioning on FRC therapy in intra-abdominal sepsis. We will determine the therapeutic efficacy of
TLR9 inhibition preconditioned FRC subsets in two clinically relevant intra-abdominal sepsis models: (1)
CLP-induced polymicrobial peritonitis; and (2) intra-abdominal infection of a human strain of Escherichia
coli. We will also use an LPS-induced peritonitis model to determine the mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of FRC-based therapy and the impact of TLR9 on individual FRC subset therapies. Our
study will advance understanding of the diversity and biology of FRC subsets as well as the regulation of
TLR9 in these distinct subsets, which will discover new strategies to modify selective FRC subsets to
improve efficacy of FRC-based therapy for sepsis and other immune dysregulation diseases."
10756438,"Abstract/Summary
In addition to its well-established role in motor function and motor learning, the cerebellum is implicated in a
myriad of non-motor behaviors. In humans, cerebellar damage can impair abstract reasoning and working
memory, and result in PTSD. In animal models, the cerebellum regulates heart rate, breathing, aggression,
appetite, fear conditioning and many other behaviors. In general, the role of the cerebellum in regulating these
behaviors is not well understood. An important step in understanding these nonmotor behaviors is to determine
the output pathway and downstream targets that allow the cerebellum to regulate these behaviors. It is known
that Purkinje cells (PCs) relay signals from the cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), which in
turn activate the motor thalamus. It was assumed that DCN outputs are also responsible for nonmotor
behaviors. Here, we describe powerful and direct inhibitory connections between PCs in regions of the
cerebellum implicated in nonmotor behaviors, and neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). This is
intriguing, because the PBN contributes to many of the same nonmotor behaviors influenced by the
cerebellum. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the PBN is a specialized cerebellar output
that allows the cerebellum to regulate nonmotor behaviors. The first step in testing this hypothesis will be to
characterize the connections between PCs and the PBN. The studies will determine the strength and
prevalence of the direct PC to PBN synapse and determine the extent to which PCs regulate the activity of
neurons in the PBN. The second major step is to identify the regions targeted by the PCPBN pathway and to
determine the contribution of this pathway to various behaviors. Preliminary studies suggest that this pathway
projects to the hypothalamus, the amygdala, and the basal forebrain, and thus has the appropriate connectivity
to allow the cerebellum to regulate diverse behaviors ranging from aggression to fear extinction. This promises
to lead to a new appreciation of the roles of the cerebellum in numerous behaviors, it will provide insight into
the circuits involved in these behaviors and it has important implications for many neurological disorders."

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a cofactor required for glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
and enzymatic reaction in electron transport chain (ETC). In mammalian cells, NAD+ salvage pathway, where
nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme, is the predominant pathway for
NAD+ biosynthesis. Although the dysregulation of NAD+ in aging and neurodegerative diseases has been
reported, genetic diseases caused by NAMPT variants have not been clinically recognized and understood. Here
we identified the first case of an inherited neurological disease caused by a homozygous single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP), i.e., a P158A mutation in the coding region of NAMPT gene. The major clinical features of
patients include impaired motor coordination, muscle weakness, atrophy of lower extremities, positive Babiński
sign. The patients were diagnosed as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy involving axonal degeneration
and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction. Using skin-derived patient fibroblasts (p-FBs), our preliminary
studies found that P158A mutation causes reduced bioenergetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased
enzymatic activity of NAMPT for NAD+ biosynthesis compared with healthy control fibroblasts (c-FBs). The
results indicate the pathological conditions related to the patients is initially resulted from bioenergetic stress and
ultimately from neuronal and muscular degeneration. Thus, our project goal is to understand the pathogenesis
and the mechanism of neuronal and muscular degeneration of this new disease. To achieve our goal, we
generated many molecular tools including P158A-NAMPT mutant mice, c- & p-FBs-derived induced pluripotent
stem cells (c- & p-iPSCs including isogenic and patient like p-iPSCs), and iPSC-induced motor neurons (c- & p-
iMNs). We propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis P158A mutation in NAMPT causes
mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction of p-iMNs. Using iMNs, we will study the effect of P158A mutation
on cellular bioenergetics, glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. We will also conduct combined
metabolomic and transcriptional profiling to determine the molecular base of metabolic changes caused by
P158A mutation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that P158A mutation in NAMPT causes MN degeneration.
Using the mutant mice, we will study disease progression, upper and lower MN degeneration. We will use
electrophysiological and two-photon (2-P) imaging to study the effect of P158A mutation on sensory response
and cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that P158A mutation in NAMPT
causes NMJ abnormalities and muscle degeneration. We will assess structural and functional abnormalities
of NMJs and muscle contractile response of semitendinosus muscles isolated from the symptomatic mutant
mice. A human disease caused by NAMPT mutation has not been reported so far. Our application represents a
first in-depth study on the pathogenesis and mechanism of motor neuron and muscle degeneration of a new
neurological disease caused by a mutation in NAMPT gene."
10756506,"Dissecting basal ganglia circuits underlying motivated behaviors
Project Summary
 The basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, play essential roles in motor control, motivational regulation
and reinforcement learning. On the other hand, striatal dysfunctions have been implicated in a number of
neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington’s disease, obsessive
compulsive disorder, autism, depression and drug addiction. A notable feature of the dorsal striatum is its
separation into two neurochemically distinct compartments, the striosome (or “patch”) compartment and the
surrounding matrix compartment. It is thought that neurons in the matrix and those in the striosome have distinct
functions, with the former critical for motor functions, whereas the latter important for evaluation functions during
learning and for regulation of motivation. In addition, the striosome compartment has been especially implicated
in the non-motor aspects of the neurological disorders, such as learning deficits, and mood and motivational
aberrations. However, despite intensive study, to date the functionality of neurons in the striosome remains
largely uncharacterized. Consequently, how striosome neurons contribute to reinforcement learning and
regulation of motivation is unclear. Whether and how dysfunctions in these neurons occur and contribute to the
diseases are also unknown.
 A major challenge to studying the striosome lies in the fact that it is labyrinthine in shape and has no clear
anatomical boundaries, making it difficult to precisely target for in vivo recording or manipulation. To address this
issue, we recently exploited mouse genetics for targeting neurons in the striosome. This strategy laid the
foundation for selectively monitoring and manipulating the activities of different populations of striosome neurons.
In the proposed study, we will capitalize on our approach and findings to investigate the behavioral roles of
distinct striosome populations in health and disease, and to uncover the underlying circuit and cellular
mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that functionally distinct striosome populations differentially control
reward seeking and punishment avoidance through different circuit mechanisms. We further hypothesize that
these striosome neurons become dysfunctional after major stressful life events, thereby causing maladaptive
behaviors. We will test our hypotheses in the following Aims:
 Aim 1. To determine the behavioral roles of distinct classes of striosome neurons.
 Aim 2. To determine the circuit and cellular mechanisms underlying striosome functions.
 Aim 3. To elucidate the striosome dysfunctions underlying stress-induced maladaptive behaviors."

Traditional drug delivery platforms are limited by the amount of drug that can be loaded into the delivery system.
While drug loading capacity can reach 50% by weight for some polymeric systems, the time period over which
the delivery of the therapeutic can be sustained is often limited. In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of a local
drug delivery system is related to the local bioavailability of the active agent. Devices that bio-catalytically
produce the therapeutic in situ could thus provide more effective local delivery of the active drug and improve
therapeutic efficacy. The long-term vision for this program is to create the next-generation 3D printed in situ drug
production and delivery devices, including drug-eluting stents, microneedles, and patches, based on engineered
living materials (ELMs) for localized and sustained therapeutic delivery. ELMs are composites of microorganisms
incorporated within a polymeric matrix, wherein the cells maintain their viability and can be metabolically
engineered to produce a therapeutic compound. Despite the immense potential of ELMs for drug delivery
applications, the primary challenges to the deployment of ELMs as drug-eluting stents or patches to treat
intestinal diseases are that ELMs must (i) be processable into precise form factors (e.g., patient-specific stents)
with the requisite mechanical properties, (ii) biodegrade into non-cytotoxic components at predetermined rates,
and (iii) bio-catalytically produce and elute the therapeutic agent in situ for the lifetime of the device. The objective
of this proposal is to develop 3D printable resins that afford biodegradable hydrogel constructs with a tunable
stiffness, and to demonstrate the fabrication of a prototype ELM device for sustained delivery of a model
compound. In Aim 1, we will create aqueous resins with non-pathogenic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) that can be
3D printed into hydrogel constructs using a commercially available 3D printer. We will formulate aqueous resins
comprised of soluble globular protein derivatives that can be co-polymerized with water-soluble acrylate
monomers upon photo-initiated polymerization. The mechanical properties of the ELM hydrogels (stiffness,
strength, and toughness) and rates of enzymatic degradation will be quantified for each resin formulation. In Aim
2, we will metabolically engineer non-pathogenic EcN to produce berberine as a model therapeutic compound.
We will further evaluate the cytotoxicity and epithelial integrity of Caco-2 cells in the presence of 3D printed
ELMs. As validation of these ELMs we will use an in vitro model to confirm the production and elution of berberine
from the 3D printed ELM by evaluating the Caco-2 response to proinflammatory stimulation. We envision these
3D printed ELMs to be used as devices for local drug delivery in the treatment of malignancies or inflammatory
diseases affecting the intestines. While our ELM platform is compatible with a broad array of microorganisms
that include yeast and bacteria, we have chosen to focus on engineered variants of E. coli Nissle 1917, a
commensal strain of bacteria common within the gut microbiome. Using a microorganism native to the human
microbiome may facilitate translation of our platform to treat intestinal diseases."
10756448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently, several genital anaerobic bacteria that are not classically associated with sexually transmitted
infections (non-STI) were linked to increased heterosexual transmission of HIV, likely by inducing immune
responses that enhances HIV target cell activation and recruitment to the genital mucosa. This project seeks
to close critical knowledge gaps regarding acquisition and persistent carriage of this new HIV risk factor. Our
long-term goals are to elucidate the determinants of genital microbiome composition and the biological
mechanisms that link genital bacteria to host susceptibility to HIV, and to leverage this knowledge to develop
innovative solutions to prevent HIV. The objective is to understand the heterosexual transmission dynamics
of genital bacteria associated with HIV risk and to determine the abiotic and biotic factors that impact
acquisition and persistence of these genital bacteria in men. Our central hypothesis is that perturbations
affect penile microbiome composition—including acquisition, loss, or persistence of genital bacteria
associated with HIV risk—predictably based a set of abiotic and biotic factors. The rationale for this project is
that, by understanding the abiotic and biotic factors that determine acquisition, loss, or persistence of specific
genital bacteria, we will be able to identify and develop new strategies to prevent or reduce colonization.
Aim 1. Elucidate the sexual transmission of genital bacteria and the determinants of the penile
microbiome after sex. We will test this by: (i) Characterize the genital bacteria strains present in adolescent
boys before and after sexual debut (n = 200) and (ii) Determine the effect of pre-coital host (penile) and
partner (vaginal) genital pH, oxygenation, moisture, metabolites, anti-bacteria IgA, and microbiome on the
acquisition or persistence (1, 8, and 72 hour post-sex) of genital bacteria in the host (n = 106 couples).
Aim 2. Elucidate the determinants of the penile microbiome after antimicrobial treatment. We will test
this by comparing pre- and post- treatment (Day 3, 8, and 28) penile microbiomes in 1 control arm and 4
treatment arms, including 3 topical treatments: (i) 2% clindamycin, (ii) 1% H2O2, (iii) 0.75% metronidazole,
and (iv) oral tinidazole.
Aim 3. Validate the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on the penile microbiome response to
perturbation using an in vitro model. We will achieve this aim by adding: (i) donor vaginal microbiome and
(ii) topical antimicrobials to penile microbiome in organotypic foreskin model to assess the effect of abiotic
factors and bacterial strains on microbiome outcome.
The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, because it represents a departure from the status
quo by elucidating transmissible dysbiosis, and doing so with absolute abundance metrics, innovative
study designs, and a novel co-culture model. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to reveal how sex and antimicrobials impact penile microbiome and what drives outcome."

There are clear limitations to the current approach to prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. Approximately half of
the men who undergo a transrectal prostate biopsy—an extremely uncomfortable, invasive procedure with
significant risk including sepsis—are not found to have PCa. For those who have PCa, many have indolent
cancers that are best managed with active surveillance (AS), which requires annual repeat biopsies due to a
lack of accurate noninvasive tools. Biomarkers and prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been
increasingly used to attempt to address this problem. However, the currently available tools are not accurate
enough alone or in combination to forgo biopsy.
We have developed a new MRI sequence (diffusion basis spectrum imaging) and a method of analyzing these
imaging metrics—diffusion histology imaging (DHI)—that may overcome the limitations of conventional MRI
interpretation. Preliminary data demonstrates high accuracy of DHI to predict prostate biopsy results
(presence of cancer and grade of cancer when present). We aim to apply DHI to patients in two distinct clinical
settings: Aim 1, initial biopsy for PSA screening, and Aim 2, repeat biopsy for known indolent PCa managed
with AS. We also plan for Aim 3 to update our DHI model based on the data obtained in these aims, then
recruit and test the updated DHI model in an independent group of patients undergoing PSA screening. We
hypothesize that DHI will allow for accurate and non-invasive diagnosis of PCa, and thus reduce unnecessary
biopsies.
In our proposed studies, the men will have had biomarker testing, then receive a clinical prostate MRI
(conventional sequences) with the DBSI imaging protocol added onto it prior to biopsy. The DBSI imaging will
be analyzed post-acquisition by our DHI model. Note that the DBSI protocol will add just a few minutes to the
total duration of the clinical MRI and will not significantly impact the patient or the clinical imaging workflow. In
parallel to conventional MRI interpretation and biopsy per clinical care, our team will perform DHI analysis on
the MRI images. By comparing DHI to biomarkers and conventional MRI against the histopathologic gold
standard (biopsy) in a prospective manner, we will determine if DHI can be used to noninvasively diagnose and
monitor PCa; therefore, supporting the clinical translation of DHI to be used as an alternative to invasive
biopsies."
10781292,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with
~ 82k new diagnoses estimated for 2023. Surgery is the preferred option for initial management of RCC, but the
number of patients who qualify is reduced each year due to the aging, comorbid population. Histotripsy is a
noninvasive, focused ultrasound therapy used for tissue ablation via bubble activity, and is an attractive
alternative to surgery. Indeed, a pilot clinical trial to test histotripsy for the treatment of RCC is scheduled for
2023. Standard B-mode ultrasound imaging is used to monitor histotripsy via the detection of hyperintense
bubble pixels. In the kidney, histotripsy bubbles are obscured on B-mode due to artifacts, image degradation at
depth, and a lack of contrast specificity. Patients will be disqualified from receiving treatment with histotripsy
when bubbles cannot be located and monitored with imaging. Further, B-mode bubble imaging does not provide
the information necessary to assess the likelihood of successful oncological outcomes. Real-time feedback to
adjust the histotripsy exposure and ensure ablation is of particular importance for heterogenous tumors common
to RCC. Hence, there is a need for improved histotripsy bubble detection to enable therapy automation. To
address this gap, we have developed ultrafast, bubble-specific ultrasound imaging for monitoring histotripsy.
Using this imaging sequence, we can assess the diffusive properties of histotripsy bubbles, a key marker of
ablation outcomes, with sub-millisecond resolution. The scientific premise of this study is that ultrafast imaging
will elevate histotripsy bubble monitoring, and provide feedback to ensure effective and safe RCC ablation. We
have demonstrated strong translational potential to monitor histotripsy with ultrafast imaging in vitro, ex vivo, and
in murine renal tumors on a pre-clinical system. Our objective is to refine and integrate this sequence onto a
clinical-grade imager, develop and test feedback algorithms in RCC tissues and a relevant large animal model,
and rapidly translate this imaging protocol into use in patients. To test our scientific premise, we will investigate
the following aims: We will develop a translational histotripsy system for RCC in Specific Aim 1. We will integrate
our ultrafast sequence onto a clinical-grade imaging platform, and evaluate its sensitivity and accuracy for bubble
detection. In Specific Aim 2, methods to monitor and modulate the bubble cloud lifetime will be developed. These
methods will be used to adjust the histotripsy pulsing rate to enhance the efficacy of histotripsy ablation. Specific
Aim 3 will use information on the bubble cloud dissolution rate to provide real-time feedback of treatment
outcomes using an in vivo porcine kidney ablation model. The rate of urological sequelae will be determined in
short-term survival studies. This study will deliver validated ultrafast sequences on a commercial histotripsy
imaging system to improve RCC ablation and ensure safety. Following these validation steps, the sequence will
be translated immediately in a clinical trial for histotripsy RCC."
10783012,"Abstract
High-grade gliomas are a leading cause of cancer-related death in adults and children. They are highly
heterogeneous diseases in which both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity contribute to disease
progression and therapeutic failure. In HGG, defined cellular states with key phenotypic
characteristics are selected for during tumorigenesis, drive tumor evolution, and underlie
resistance to therapy and invasion. In particular, HGG are thought to be driven by glioma stem cells
(GSC), subpopulations of cells recapitulating aspects of neural development that have the preferential
capacity to self-renew and to generate differentiated cancer cells. Traditional methodologies to identify
GSC rely on functional assays with important caveats and thus do not allow a comprehensive
characterization of cellular states in human patients. Additionally, while models of GSC and HGG are
extensively used for research, very little is known about their capacity to comprehensively mirror the
spectrum of cellular states present in patient samples; due to these limitations, vulnerabilities identified
in models frequently do not translate to clinical settings. Accordingly, we propose that the range of
cellular states that drive HGG should first be defined directly from patient samples, at single cell
resolution, and subsequently be functionally tested in animal and cell-based models. More
specifically, we will leverage single-cell RNA-sequencing and a comprehensive systems biology
approach in order to (I) identify tumor subpopulations unbiasedly across different genetic clones in
human HGG and in matched models of disease, at single-cell resolution; (II) functionally test the
capacity of these subpopulations to initiate tumors and to re-generate the diversity of states present in
patients; (III) identify faithful cell models that can recapitulate defined cellular states observed in patients
and utilize them to experimentally identify regulators with potential utility in clinical settings. Successful
completion of the research will fill a fundamental and large gap of knowledge in understanding
brain cancer in patients and in models and will provide novel opportunities to target key cellular
states that are driving these incurable malignancies. Furthermore, the proposed approach could be
extended to other malignancies, and will provide a proof-of-concept for uncovering subpopulations that
drive tumor growth directly from patient samples, and subsequently identifying regulators with potential
clinical relevance."
10783020,"Summary/Abstract
 Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of death in patients with
neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1). MPNSTs arise in NF1 patients from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) but it is
unclear why only ~30% of PNFs transform into MPNSTs. Recent studies suggest that inactivation of the
INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus (called CDKN2A for INK4a and ARF; CDKN2B for INK4b) generates a pre-malignant
lesion called an atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm of uncertain biology (ANNUBP). ANNUBPs are the newly
recognized precursor to MPNSTs, but mechanisms that drive and classify this transitional intermediate are poorly
defined. INK4a/ARF/INK4b disruption is the main alteration currently linked to ANNUBPs, besides NF1 loss and
RABL6A upregulation. In MPNSTs, the locus is altered at one, two or all three genes, with worse patient survival
associated with loss of all three. Each gene (INK4a, ARF, and INK4b) encodes a tumor suppressor, but their
separate contributions and cooperativity with other factors in driving cancer remain incompletely understood.
Given their prominent role, a better understanding of INK4a, ARF, and INK4b in MPNST development is needed,
as drugs targeting the locus are either approved or showing promise in other cancers.
 Our central hypothesis is p16Ink4a, ARF and p15Ink4b act cooperatively in multiple pathways to
suppress the transformation of benign PNFs and ANNUBPs to MPNSTs. Aim 1 will define significant genetic
and proteomic events coinciding with INK4a, ARF and INK4b inactivation in human ANNUBPs and MPNSTs by
genetic, molecular and histologic analyses. Results will be correlated to clinical variables such as survival. The
prognostic value of a newly developed liquid biopsy assay evaluating locus status and other tumor markers will
be determined in NF1 patients. Aim 2 employs CRISPR editing of p16Ink4a, ARF and/or p15Ink4b in human
PNF-derived cells to determine their roles in PNF-ANNUBP-MPNST transformation. Directed analyses of
suspected MPNST driver genes in cells and mouse models will identify genes that selectively cooperate with
INK4a, ARF, or INK4b loss to drive ANNUBP-MPNST transformation in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 establishes the
biological significance of drugs targeting Ink4a/Arf/Ink4b relevant pathways in PNF-ANNUBP-MPNST therapy
and prevention. Predicted mediators of acquired resistance to therapy will be verified using molecular and
pharmacologic approaches. Studies will determine the value of targeted therapy against pre-MPNST models to
prevent malignant progression. Impact: Studies will provide new insights into INK4a/ARF/INK4b, one of the most
frequently inactivated loci in human cancers. Innovative animal models of PNF-ANNUBP-MPNST progression
will be generated and mechanisms of transformation leading to MPNST will be defined. Preclinical studies will
assess a new combination therapy targeting Ink4a/Arf/Ink4b pathways in preventing malignant progression.
Results will advance our understanding of events driving MPNST development, facilitating earlier diagnosis and
pre-emptive interventions targeting ANNUBPs."
10781736,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 2.5 million skin cancers are diagnosed annually in the United States, more than all other forms of cancers
combined. Early diagnosis is critical; thus, we propose to develop a soft and wearable magnetoelastic
microneedle patch (MMP) for non-invasive and rapid skin cancer screening. It could perform fast scanning of the
spatial stiffness of skin lesions with depths of up to 5 mm. This concept is established on the basis of the PI’s
prior success in discovering the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft matter (Nat. Mater. 2021, 20, 1670). With a
fundamentally new working mechanism, the proposed soft MMP can cover a large detection area (7.7 cm2) and
have a high spatial resolution (1 mm, trained with super-resolution algorithm), high framerate (2000 Hz), and
ultrahigh sensitivity (<2 kPa). We hypothesize that the proposed soft MMP enables fast, non-invasive scanning
of skin stiffness of both lesions and borders spatially, which can be used experimentally and/or in clinics for skin
cancer early diagnosis and screening, longitudinal monitoring, and/or guiding cancer excisions. To test our
hypothesis, we propose three aims. Aim 1: Scalable design and optimization of a soft MMP for fast spatial
stiffness mapping. Aim 2: Validate the soft MMP via stiffness mapping in mice models with skin cancer. Aim 3:
Validate the soft MMP via stiffness mapping in excised human skin cancer."

Niemann-Pick disease type C is a fatal, autosomal recessive lipid storage disease affecting all ages. Before
neurological defects appear, ~85% of patients develop hepatomegaly which can progress into hepatic
steatosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. Liver defects are particularly detrimental in
patients with neonatal-onset, 10% of whom die from liver failure by 6 months of age. Although the liver is a
significant contributor to disease, few Niemann-Pick C liver therapeutics are being developed. Niemann-Pick C
is commonly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene (95% of cases), encoding a multipass
transmembrane glycoprotein required for exporting unesterified cholesterol from late endosomes and
lysosomes. The most common disease-causing mutation (~20% of cases) is an isoleucine to threonine
substitution at position 1061 (I1061T). I1061T-NPC1 misfolds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is rapidly
degraded by the proteasome and ER-autophagy. Importantly, I1061T-NPC1 is functional if trafficked to the
lysosome. This observation spurred interest in understanding NPC1 degradation for the development of brain
proteostasis modulators. However, it is unknown if neuronal NPC1 proteostasis modulators will work in the
liver due to the limited understanding of liver NPC1 regulation. Furthermore, our strong preliminary data
indicate that liver NPC1 is more heavily glycosylated than brain NPC1. Given the critical role of glycans in
protein folding, trafficking, function, and degradation there is a need to understand the role of NPC1 liver-
specific glycosylation. The next step in addressing this need is to pursue the overall objective of this
application: (i) produce pilot data for an RO1 which demonstrate that liver specific glycan sites are critical for
NPC1 proteostasis. Here we will test the central hypothesis that liver-specific glycans alter NPC1 proteostasis.
We will test our hypothesis using LC-MS/MS to identify NPC1 glycan sites in human liver and brain. Next, we
will take advantage of NPC1 null iPSC derived hepatocytes and add back constructs containing WT, WT
without liver specific glycans, I1061T, and I1061T without liver specific glycans. We will leverage biochemical
and genetic assays to establish the extent to which liver-specific glycan sites impact NPC1 proteostasis (Aim
1). The rationale for this project is that defining the location and influence of tissue-specific NPC1 glycans will
provide deeper insight into NPC1 proteostasis and a strong scientific framework for the development of new
Niemann-Pick C liver proteostatic therapeutics. In addition to moving my research into a highly understudied
research topic, we anticipate this work will provide a strong scientific framework to investigate he how liver-
specific NPC1 glycans regulate proteostasis as a future aim in an R01 grant from NIDDK."

There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations in the cohesin complex, a multimeric protein
complex essential for sister chromatid cohesion, chromatin organization into loops and gene regulation, cause
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem because
despite the high frequency of cohesin mutations in MDS and its association with high risk of disease and poor
outcomes, there are currently no treatment strategies to specifically target cohesin-mutant cells in MDS. STAG2
mutations are mutually exclusive with mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1, the most commonly mutated gene
in MDS. Furthermore, cohesin proteins have been shown to bind SF3 splicing factors and RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) and are dependent on normal spliceosome function for their survival. New genetically engineered models
of cohesin-mutant MDS offer a unique opportunity to test the contribution of disease alleles to splicing
abnormalities and therapeutic response, and to dissect the interaction between the cohesin and splicing
complexes. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes in cohesin-mutant MDS by deeper mechanistic
understanding of disease biology. The overall objective of this application is to determine why splicing is a genetic
dependency in cohesin-mutant MDS. The central hypothesis is that an RNA-mediated interaction between
cohesin and splicing complexes is disrupted in cohesin-mutant MDS and leads to splicing deregulation and
dependency of cohesin-mutant cells on proper splicing, which can be exploited therapeutically. Guided by strong
preliminary data from the applicant’s laboratory, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)
Determine the splicing changes and the effect of splicing modulation on STAG2-mutant MDS; and 2) Dissect the
interaction between the cohesin complex and the SF3B splicing complex. Under the first Aim, the applicant will
characterize transcriptional and splicing changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of a novel genetic
murine model of progression from Tet2-mutant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) to
Tet2/Stag2-mutant MDS. They will also test the effect of splicing modulation on MDS progression in vivo and
using cohesin-mutant MDS patient samples. Under the second Aim, a combination of transcriptomic and cross-
linking and immunoprecipitation experiments will be used in several well established in vitro models to identify
specific RNA species that mediate the interaction between the cohesin and splicing complexes. The approach
is innovative through the application of novel murine models. The downstream effects of the interaction between
cohesin and splicing and its disruption in cohesin-mutant MDS have not been clarified, and the mechanisms
driving splicing dependency in cohesin-mutant cells are unknown. The proposed research is significant, because
it is expected to define the biological role of cohesin mutations in a high-risk subset of MDS associated with poor
outcomes. The expected output for the proposed research is that the knowledge gained will be immediately
clinically significant for patients with cohesin-mutant MDS and inform new treatment strategies."
10932945,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the rapid onset
of premature aging beginning in childhood. The condition is caused by a mutation in the nuclear lamin LMNA
gene, which leads to the production of a dominant gain-of-function isoform of the protein, called progerin.
Progerin causes major disruptions to nuclear morphology and function, including nuclear protein export and
mitosis, replication stress, and contributes to increased DNA damage as well as the loss of heterochromatin
and dysregylation of other epigenetic marks, including cytosine-5 DNA methylation. We have recently provided
direct experimental evidence that aging-associated loss of DNA methylation at nuclear lamina-attached regions
of the genome is a direct consequence of cell division-associated DNA replication. We used this principle to
develop an epigenetic mitotic clock, called RepliTali, which provides a reliable estimate of cellular replicative
history. We hypothesize that altered DNA methylation patterns in patients with HGPS may contribute actively
to the severely accelerated aging observed in patients with HGPS. Here, we propose to conduct high-
resolution analyses of DNA methylation alterations in serially cultured HGPS cells and to investigate whether
we can extend the lifespan of HGPS model systems by manipulating DNA methylation patterns.
 In Specific Aim 1 we will define DNA methylation dynamics in serially cultured HGPS fibroblasts from early
passage through replicative senescence using cost-effective Infinium DNA methylation arrays.
 In Specific Aim 2 we will conduct high-resolution single-cell methylome analyses at key stages of HGPS
fibroblast culture to detect arising aberrations and delineate population transitions. We have developed a
single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (sc-WGBS) method that delivers genomic coverage far superior
to any other published sc-WGBS methods.
 In Specific Aim 3 we will investigate whether DNA methylation manipulation can extend lifespan in HGPS
models. In Aim 3A we will test whether overexpression of DNA methylation writers and erasers increases the
replicative lifespan of HGPS fibroblasts. In Aim 3B, we will target DNA methyltransferase overexpression to
arterial smooth muscle cells in an HGPS mouse model to investigate whether this reduces arterial smooth
muscle loss and extends lifespan. We will monitor DNA methylation changes in this mouse model using a new
cost-effective DNA methylation array.
 We present extensive and compelling preliminary data that demonstrates both the feasibility and relevance
of the proposed aims. The outcome of this proposed research could have important impacts on our
understanding of the contribution of DNA methylation alterations to HGPS phenotypes, potentially opening
avenues for new therapeutic approaches to treat progeria. In addition, this study could shed light on similar
mechanisms operating at a longer timescale in normal aging."

The goal of this project is to optimize and study the pharmacology of dual-targeting urea depsipeptide
(UDEP)-rifamycin hybrid antibiotics. These new agents have encouraging potential to treat biofilm-
associated and complicated Gram-positive infections including bacteremia, prosthetic joint
infections, and infective endocarditis, which are difficult to cure with standard of care antibiotics such
as vancomycin and cause significant mortality. Most antibiotics require active bacterial growth to
work effectively. Some bacteria evade killing by traditional antibiotics by growing slowly or not at all,
allowing for survival even at high drug concentrations for prolonged periods. These surviving cells
contribute to antibiotic tolerance and resistance, cause recurrent infections, prolong antibiotic
therapy, and increase associated patient care costs. Recently, we have been using structure-based
design to optimize the pharmacology of UDEP antibiotics, which overcome antibiotic tolerance by
target non-dividing bacteria. UDEPs activate the ClpP protease causing uncontrolled proteolysis,
killing stationary phase, dormant, antibiotic-tolerant cells, and biofilms. Rifampin, currently
prescribed in combination with other antibiotics to treat M. tuberculosis (MTB) and prosthetic joint
infections (PJI), also has activity against non-dividing cells by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase and blocking RNA elongation during transcription. In addition to sharing activity against
slowly-growing bacteria, UDEPs and rifampin also share the requirement to be used in combination
with other antibiotics to prevent resistance development. We hypothesized that synthesizing a dual-
targeting UDEP-rifampin hybrid antibiotic would result in significantly less resistance development
and have the potential to achieve unprecedented activity against biofilms and difficult-to-treat
infections. A single molecule has many advantages over a combination, for example, there is no need
to match the pharmacokinetics, and dosing is simpler. In this proposal, we plan to carefully optimize
UDEP-Rifamycin hybrid antibiotics using a detailed synthesis and testing cascade to ensure agents are
developed that have potent activity against persisters in vitro and in vivo, and a safe pharmacological
profile. The mode of action of the emerging leads will be carefully profiled to study their target
engagement, resistance development, effects on growing and non-growing cells."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infect ~1% of the world population, predisposing the infected individuals
to increased risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. New infections in the US has risen in the past
decade and it is estimated that only 20% of the individuals with hepatitis C are aware of their
infection, and only 15% of those have been treated. Although highly effective direct-acting
antivirals (DAAs) can cure over 95% chronic HCV patients, reinfections have been reported in
individuals who have cleared a previous infection either spontaneously or after a successful
treatment. The observations underscore that immune memory to HCV acquired through
infection is not effective against reinfection. To guide the development of a vaccine and public
health strategy to protect high-risk populations, it will be important to understand immune
memory to HCV in DAA-cured patients particularly cross-neutralizing antibody response. In this
project we will investigate how human memory B cell response is altered by chronic infection
and its recovery in chronic HCV patients undergoing DAA treatment. We will investigate why
HCV-immune lymphocytes do not maintain an effective memory against HCV after successful
DAA treatment. We will also track the functions and recovery of memory B cells encoding for
antibodies targeting conserved virus neutralizing epitopes in the patients. These cells will be
crucial for protection against HCV both in reinfection and in vaccination. This study will not only
provide an excellent opportunity to learn about human immune response impacted by chronic
viral infection but will also generate critical information for the protection against HCV infection."
10760276,"What are the cellular and network cortical mechanisms of optimal neural and behavioral performance?
Through what mechanisms do spontaneous and evoked changes in the waking state of the cortex influence
sensory processing and behavior? The goal of my laboratory is to answer these broad and important questions
at levels extending from cellular and synaptic properties, to local circuits, to thalamocortical networks,
modulation, and behavior. Answering these questions are fundamental not only to understanding the normal
operation of the brain, but also its operation in a variety of disorders, from schizophrenia, to ADHD, autism, and
others. Our proposal is ambitious, but not unreasonable or unfocused. We have already made significant
progress towards a broad outline of important pieces of the puzzle, and therefore are confident that we will make
very significant progress towards a detailed clarification of these two fundamental questions during the funding
period.
 More than a hundred years ago, two investigators, Yerkes and Dodson, noted that optimal performance
on difficult detection tasks was related to arousal level in an “inverted-U” shaped fashion. Increases from low
arousal to intermediate arousal would enhance performance on difficult tasks, while further increases in arousal
from intermediate to high would decrease performance. This result suggests that there is an “optimal state” for
both the brain and behavior. Surprisingly, until our recent study in behaving mice performing a difficult auditory
detection task, the cortical activity or circuit representation of optimal state had not been investigated. Our
investigation revealed that the optimal state for performance of a difficult auditory sensory detection task
occurred at intermediate levels of arousal and was associated with the suppression of slow corticocortical and
thalamocortical activity, a hyperpolarized and low variability of pyramidal cell membrane potential, and large
amplitude and highly reliable evoked auditory cortical synaptic responses. In an indication of the broad nature
of these effects, we observed that we could predict more than half of the variance in cortical neuronal membrane
potential, action potential, and even behavioral performance simply by measuring the pupil diameter – an easily
obtained measure of rapid (second to second) fluctuations in behavioral state. By explaining a large fraction of
neuronal and behavioral variance, we have demonstrated that the brain is much more precise and reliable than
previously thought. Here we propose to reveal the detailed cellular, modulatory, and network mechanisms that
account for these prominent effects of state variation on neural and behavioral performance. Through a
combination of state-of-the-art imaging, whole cell recording, optogenetic manipulation, and high quality
behavioral monitoring, we will be able to detail the contribution of multiple neuronal and neuromodulatory
pathways to the determination of optimal state for neural/behavioral responses."

The overall goal of the proposed research is to create an effective and scalable monitoring device as a tool for
drug screening to decouple the stigma associated with Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and cannabis
consumption, while enhancing public safety. Through the first truly point-of-need (PoN) device for accurate THC
quantification in saliva, XALIVA®, Ricovr Healthcare provides significant advances for drugs-of-abuse (DoA)
detection tools compared to what is currently on the market. Coupled with conventional counselor-delivered
intervention, XALIVA® will eliminate the burden of stigma in monitoring processes in workplaces, roadsides,
remote testing, and other public places (hospitals, schools), improving outcomes for patients by providing
sensitive, specific, and accurate detection of recent THC use, with a perfect fit with the window of impairment.
For this Phase I proposal, feasibility of a plasmonic fiber-optic absorbance biosensor (P-FAB) and the
immunoassay-based detection method with gold nanoparticle (AuNP) antibody conjugates to monitor THC levels
in oral fluid will be proven, and further development of the PoN device and workflow will be achieved. The
XALIVA® device is simple to use, requires no training, and its ability to detect a variety of analytes at ultra-
sensitive concentrations ranging from 1 fg/mL to 1 ug/mL has been already demonstrated. Ricovr Healthcare
solves the limitations of current THC saliva screening devices which are struggling with sensitivity ranges,
workflow, and cost. Further, Ricovr has distinct advantages compared to the current standard urine screening
devices, which only reveal metabolites rather than the parent compound, are invasive, stigma-loaded, take too
much time to result, and are easily manipulated."

The Center for Innovation in Point-of-Care Technologies for HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious Diseases at
Northwestern (C-THAN)'s Dissemination (Dis) Core leverages over 16 years of teaching and expertise in
conducting needs assessments for Point-of-Care (POC) and home-based technologies from the Northwestern
University Kellogg School of Management (Kellogg). Since 2006, our proposed Dis Core team has trained over
400 MBA students who conducted POC and home-based technology needs assessments in the following 18
countries: Botswana, Brazil, Cambodia, China, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria,
South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. We have conducted these
needs assessments for a variety of product developers, including Northwestern University, Abbott Diagnostics,
Alere, Becton Dickinson, Quidel Corporation, Minute Molecular, FIND, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
and the Northwestern Global Health Foundation. During the first five years of C-THAN, we conducted needs
assessments for 10 of our 26 innovators (38%), 4 (40%) with innovators from countries in Africa. These needs
assessments covered a variety of conditions including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cervical
cancer, human papillomavirus, and liver cancer. On behalf of our innovators, we conducted over 120
interviews with clinicians and stakeholders defining the broader needs for diagnostics within these conditions
as well as specific needs for sample collection and/or sample processing. We also obtained user feedback on
innovation concepts and user steps for our innovator's sample collection innovations, POC diagnostic devices,
and digital health accessories. The findings from these needs assessments not only help our innovators course
correct product design and target specifications, but also allowed our broader C-THAN team to refine our
annual solicitations. The C-THAN Dis Core will continue to train and/or conduct needs assessments for POC
and home-based technology product developers and refine our annual solicitations based upon needs
identified. The Dis Core specific aims are: 1. Facilitate and enhance interdisciplinary training on the
development, evaluation, implementation, and commercialization of POC and home-based technologies for
HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2. Conduct needs assessments for POC and home-based
technologies for HIV/AIDS and Emerging Infectious Diseases. 3. Disseminate the results of clinical needs and

10894095,"Concerted efforts have led to the development of medical countermeasures against acute radiation toxicity in
victims of a radiological accident or nuclear terrorism, thereby significantly increasing the chance of survival if
such a radiological event were to occur today. However, survivors of acute radiation toxicities may develop
delayed injuries that become clinically apparent months to years after exposure. Cardiovascular disease is one
of the main sources of morbidity and mortality in survivors of acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Nearly ten
percent of Japanese atomic bomb survivors died of cardiovascular disease, and cancer patients undergoing
thoracic radiation therapy (RT) involving cardiac exposures exhibit a 1.7- to 2-fold greater heart disease
mortality. In several reports, patients treated with RT for esophageal cancer exhibited a 1-in-3 chance of
pericardial effusion with median occurrence post-treatment of only 6 months. Since clinical reversal of
radiation-induced cardiovascular disease is difficult, if not impossible once a survivor becomes symptomatic, it
is critical to identify such injuries sooner so that the proper interventions can begin. Therefore, availability of a
blood-based test that would predict risk for delayed radiation injuries such as in the heart in asymptomatic
victims of radiation incidents is an urgent and unmet need. Herein, we propose to extend our SBIR Phase I
work to further develop our multi-omics-based CardioWatch biomarker assay. In our Phase I effort, the
CardioWatch panel predicted radiation-induced heart disease in mouse models of exposure to gamma-rays
(AUC >90%). Furthermore, biomarkers in this panel were also found to be dysregulated in serum of non-human
primates (NHP) 3-6 days after partial body irradiation. Finally, the panel was verified in a cohort of patients that
developed cardiac complications following RT for esophageal cancer. In the proposed Phase II study, we will
conduct a rigorous analytic validation of the CardioWatch assay, followed by blinded validation in test samples
from rat models as well as longitudinally collected samples from an elite survivor cohort of NHPs (N=56,
sampling at 3 time points) and a cohort of esophageal cancer patients (N=45) undergoing RT with monitoring
for cardiac outcomes. FDA biomarker qualification guidance will be sought at all steps to ensure successful
completion of technical objectives compliant with guidelines for evaluating commercialization potential of
biomarker-based tests. The final product of this study will be a multi-omics biomarker assay replete with
detailed standard operating procedures and a software algorithm (MetaboWatch) with a graphical user
interface provides interpretation of biomarker data and an overall risk score. Cross-validation among a
spectrum of biological samples will establish and solidify performance measurements for the CardioWatch
assay at independent clinical sites for future clinical use. The CardioWatch assay could be used as a stand-
alone risk assessment test or in conjunction with routine clinical screening. Following success in Phase II
studies, we will perform clinical evaluations to support an FDA clearance to market in a Phase IIB effort."
10780429,"Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, responsible for cognition, memory
formation, learning, and pain signaling, among other functions. Two families of integral membrane glutamate
transporters are essential players in glutamatergic neurotransmission. The VGLUT family loads glutamate into
the synaptic vesicles, and the EAAT family removes the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft following
neurotransmission. The dysregulation of these transporters under pathologic conditions and neurologic disorders
disrupts glutamate homeostasis leading to aberrant neurotransmission, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuronal
death. Ions play crucial roles in the function of these transporters. Electrochemical gradients of ions power the
concentrative glutamate uptake and regulate transporters. In addition, transporters can conduct ions in a manner
uncoupled from the neurotransmitter uptake, modulating electrochemical trans-membrane gradients. This grant
proposal aims to understand the mechanism and evolution of ion-coupling mechanisms, mechanisms of the
uncoupled ion permeation in health and disease, and ion-mediated regulation. We will combine bioinformatics,
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and other biophysical and
biochemical approaches to pinpoint the residues, the conformational states, and the dynamic properties of
transporters underlying their interactions with ions."
10857205,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The perturbation of phospho-tyrosine mediated signaling networks is an essential occurrence during the
multistep process of tumor development and progression. As a result, the components of these phospho-tyrosine
signaling networks, especially tyrosine kinases, have been shown to be a key reservoir of actionable molecular
targets for the treatment of cancer. In recent years, it has been revealed that the tumor microenvironment plays
a critical role in modulating the signaling pathways that govern tumor progression and metastasis. The features
of a tumor's microenvironment have been shown to produce unique sensitivities and resistances to different
treatment modalities. One major aspect of the tumor microenvironment which is often overlooked in preclinical
studies is oxygen tension. This proposal seeks to understand the impact that oxygen tension has on
phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling networks in solid tumors, and how the resultant vulnerabilities can be
targeted to improve patient outcome. In Aim 1.1 (prior studies), we sought to identify alterations in signaling
networks that occur when lung cancer cells colonize the brain, a hypoxic environment. We showed that brain-
metastatic lung cancer cells elevate and have an increased dependence on a non-canonical HSF1-E2F
transcriptional program for survival. Importantly, we identified that this transcriptional program is targetable
through treatment with allosteric ABL2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In Aim 1.2 (proposed studies), using a small
molecule screen, I have identified previously unrecognized modulators of the cellular response to hypoxia, a
tumor microenvironment feature associated with increased metastasis and lower overall survival in patients with
solid tumors. The top uncharacterized hit was the FDA-approved ABL1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib and
my preliminary investigation has shown that the ABL kinases are critical regulators of HIF-1α protein stability. I
will continue mechanistic investigation of the ABL- HIF-1α axis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, in Aim 2 (post-doctoral
studies), I will focus on understanding the impact that tumor representative- oxygen tension has on protein
tyrosine phosphatase activity. Extensive investigation has demonstrated that tumor hypoxia induces activation
of phospho-tyrosine signaling networks, but current work has almost exclusively focused on the role of tyrosine
kinases. I show that hypoxia induces inhibitory oxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Using mass-
spectrometry based approaches, I will identify the oxidized- PTP landscape (ox-PTPome) of tumor samples and
cancer cells at oxygen levels observed in tumors. Further, since PTPs restrain cellular signaling, I will employ
high-throughput drug screening technologies in vitro to identify emergent sensitivities due to the loss of PTP
activity that would not have been captured in the numerous normoxically (tumor-unrepresentative oxygen level)
performed screens. Overall, the focus of my career is to understand how the different characteristics of the tumor
microenvironment, such as hypoxia, modulates the signaling networks co-opted by cancer cells and translate
this to the identification of biological mechanisms that may be amenable to therapeutic exploitation."

Approximately 3% percent of infants and children 6 to <72 months have strabismus or amblyopia. The
development of amblyopia and strabismus are proposed to be the result of abnormal visual experience. Normal
visual experience depends on both good retinal image quality and eye alignment, which require complex
interactions between the afferent and efferent visual systems. Understanding these interactions are critical to
both the development of preventive measures and the accumulation of evidence-based treatment strategies for
strabismus and amblyopia. Hyperopic infants who do not emmetropize are at risk for developing strabismus and
amblyopia with as little as 2D spherical equivalent (SE), and that risk increases exponentially with every added
diopter of uncorrected hyperopia. Moreover, the infants who are less likely to emmetropize, are the ones who do
not accommodate well to a near stimulus.
Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that there is a deficit in or immaturity of the afferent visual system that
causes poor blur detection which subsequently results in a decreased efferent accommodative response. We
will examine retinal blur detection in infants with typical refractive error and with moderate/high hyperopia
longitudinally at 3- and 9-months of age.
Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the tonic adaptive components of accommodation are the primary
factors responsible for the manifestation of accommodative esotropia in young children with clinically significant
hyperopia. We will measure the phasic response and tonic adaptive components of the adult oculomotor control
model in children ages 2 to <6 years with moderate/high hyperopia, including some with accommodative
esotropia prior to refractive error correction.
Long term Goal: Provide pediatric vision care practitioners with the ability to identify: [a] which infants with
hyperopia will emmetropize and which will not and [b] of the infants who do not emmetropize, which ones will go
on to develop strabismus and amblyopia. Improved ability to identify infants at highest risk will lead to improved
patient outcomes."

Ribosome profiling isolates ribosome-protected fragments for sequencing and reveals active translation at the
single-nucleotide resolution in vivo. It represents a valuable approach to study various aspects of protein
synthesis, such as the regulation of translation efficiency, alternative translation initiation, ribosome elongation
and pausing, codon usage, and identifying non-canonical open reading frames and micropeptides (<100 amino
acids) encoded in a genome. Thus, it provides unique molecule insights of translational control, which could not
be achieved by other genomic technologies, such as mass spectrometry or polysome profiling. However, current
ribosome profiling protocols generally use complicated experimental procedures to isolate ribosome-RNA
complexes such as though a sucrose cushion, and require millions of input cells. This technical barrier has
prevented its application to examing translation profiles of primary physiological tissue samples with low-input
cell numbers. To tackle this long-standing challenge, here we propose to develop an ultra-low-input RNase
footprinting approach for the rapid quantification of cytosolic and mitochondrial translation simultaneously. Our
method simplified the experimental procedure to select ribosome footprints based on optimized RNase digestion.
My lab has made the assay work well for as few as 1,000 cultured cells. In this proposal, we aim to further
develop the assay and make it work robustly for a small amount of primary tissue samples (Aim 1). Furthermore,
we will apply the method to map the RNA translation landscape of rare progenitor cells and differentiated cell
types during hematopoiesis (Aim 2). The results will reveal novel mechanisms mediating the translational control
underlying hematopoietic cell fate decisions. Finally, by leveraging that our assay provides a simplified method
to study mitochondrial translation, we will use it to examine the heterogeneity of mitochondrial translation
machinery and build the functional network mediated by individual factors (Aim 3). Altogether, the refined ultra-
low-input RNase footprinting method developed in this proposal will be a valuable tool and can be widely used
to study the translational regulation underlying complex physiological conditions from normal development to
disease progression."

How cells move proteins and organelles to create functionally specialized regions is a central question of cell
biology. Often, this process involves molecular motors moving along cytoskeletal tracks. We study the assem-
bly of cilia, which are thin cell projections with critical roles in cell motility and signaling. The axoneme, a com-
plex microtubule-based machine, mediates ciliary bending to propel spermatozoa and generate fluid-flow
above ciliated epithelia. The ciliary membrane is enriched in signaling proteins that achieve, for example, sens-
ing of light, hormones, and mechanical cues. Cilia are widely distributed in the mammalian body and ciliary
dysfunction causes many diseases ranging from male infertility to blindness. This has boosted an interest in
how cilia are assembled and maintained. Because cilia lack protein synthesis, its 1000+ proteins need to be
imported from the cell body. This involves the conserved intraflagellar transport (IFT) pathway, a bidirectional,
motor-based motility of polymeric protein carriers, the IFT trains, along the axonemal microtubules. IFT shuttles
proteins in and out of cilia but how it selects its cargoes and how the cargo load on the trains is regulated re-
mains largely unknown. We will address these questions using the unicellular model Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii, which facilitates in vivo imaging of protein transport in its two 9+2 cilia with single-molecule sensitivity.
We showed that IFT carries several proteins of the ciliary membrane and axoneme and that axonemal protein
transport is sharply upregulated in short growing cilia, likely explaining the critical role of IFT in ciliary assem-
bly. Over the next five years, we will investigate how IFT selects its cargoes, releases them in cilia and how the
frequency of transport is regulated. A focus will be ARMC2, an adapter protein that mediates IFT of the radial
spoke precursor complex. Pathogenic mutations in mammalian ARMC2 are linked to male infertility and re-
duced lung function. We will determine ARMC2’s functional domains for radial spoke and IFT binding and in-
vestigate whether autoinhibition and ciliary length-dependent activation of ARMC2 regulate the transport fre-
quency. We showed that cells increase the cargo load on IFT trains when cilia are short but how they sense
ciliary length is unclear. To this end, we will study Chlamydomonas LF5 kinase; loss of LF5 causes abnormally
long cilia. LF5 is an ortholog of CDK-like5, which when mutated causes epileptic activity and impaired neurode-
velopment. We will determine if LF5 reduces ciliary protein entry by IFT to restrain length. While IFT is the pre-
dominant pathway to move ciliary building blocks into cilia, other proteins, especially of the ciliary membrane,
use alternative ways of entry. Besides transmembrane proteins, ciliary signaling involves proteins that associ-
ate with the membrane by lipidation. We studied how such proteins are removed from cilia and will now explore
how they enter and accumulate in cilia, likely in an IFT-independent manner. We expect to gain insights into a
novel pathway that cages such proteins in the ciliary membrane. Our broad goal is to understand how ciliary
protein transport is regulated to ensure the assembly of cilia with the desired size, composition and function."

Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that results in the formation of gametes. Meiotic recombination is a
crucial step in this process during which homologous chromosomes physically interact and exchange genetic
information. The final recombination DNA intermediate in this process is the double Holliday Junction (dHJ). A
major question in the meiosis field is the mechanism through which dHJs are resolved in a biased manner to
create crossover products between homologs. Mlh1-Mlh3, the nuclease responsible for resolving the majority
of dHJs in budding yeast, does not appear to be intrinsically capable of recognizing and cleaving dHJs in a
biased manner. This observation combined with genetic screens revealing a wide variety of crossover
promoting factors indicates that other proteins may interact at the dHJ to promote biased resolution. Here I aim
to interrogate Exo1, a crossover promoting factor with well-established roles as a nuclease in homology
directed repair (HDR) and mismatch repair (MMR). Interestingly, despite playing an important role in crossover
formation previous work shows that catalytically deficient exo1 mutants do not suffer reductions in crossover
frequencies, suggesting a meiotic role for Exo1 that is independent of its nuclease activity. Here, I will
investigate the mechanism through which Exo1 promotes the formation of crossovers. I hypothesize that Exo1
acts as a scaffold at the dHJ to stabilize and orient Mlh1-Mlh3 through direct interaction with both the DNA and
Mlh1. Additionally, I will follow up on my recent work indicating a pro-CO activity of Exo1 independent of Mlh1
Mlh3 functions that acts upstream of resolution. This work will provide insight into long-standing questions in
the meiosis field and open up exciting new paths for future research."
10931625,"Abstract: Auditory and vestibular sensory cells use the hair bundle, a stair-cased array of actin filled
stereocilia, to translate mechanical motion into an electrical signal. Mechanically-gated (MET) ion channels
located at the tips of shorter stereocilia are activated by force created by the pulling of a tip link that extends
between stereocilia. As sensory hair bundles are a major site for both genetic disorders like Ushers syndrome
and are also susceptible to damage from noise and aging, understanding how these bundles operate is critical
to designing therapies for prevention and restoration of function. Mammalian cochlear hair bundles have unusual
morphologies and interstereocilia connectivity that is not as tight as other inner ear end organs. There is
considerable debate as to the mechanisms underlying processes impacting MET currents and hair bundle
mechanics, like fast and slow adaptation, gating compliance and voltage driven responses. There is further
controversy over whether we truly have causal links between MET current responses and mechanical, molecular
mechanisms. Before being able to use the power of genetic manipulation of newly identified MET molecules, we
need a clear understanding of hair bundle biophysical properties and how they impact MET receptor currents.
We hypothesize that the lack of connectivity in bundle motion is to optimize the hair bundle's response to natural
stimulation and that synchronization of stereocilia comes from the tectorial membrane (OHCs) or the fluid
stimulation (IHCs). We further hypothesize that we will identify mechanical correlates for fast and slow adaptation
as well as gating compliance; however, we do expect there to be less slow adaptation as compared to other hair
cell types but also that the mechanism of slow adaptation will not align with classical theories. And finally. we
hypothesize that MET channel properties work with hair bundle mechanics to create tuning of the receptor
current. We will investigate each of these hypotheses in the following specific aims. SA1 will generate a
comprehensive data set of MET channel and hair bundle properties at multiple frequency positions from rats and
mice P10-12 of age. By taking advantage of three modes of stimulations, wide probe, fluid jet and the newly
developed narrow probe, we can separate between MET channel and hair bundle properties. SA2 will directly
address hair bundle mechanics and known hair bundle properties using the newly developed high-speed imaging
with either narrow probe or fluid jet technology. Experiments will target MET channel gating compliance, fast and
slow adaptation and voltage dependent mechanical hair bundle responses. SA3 will generate frequency
response curves under physiological conditions using the wide probe and fluid jet to define the filtering properties
of the channel and the hair bundle. Completion of these aims will provide an unprecedented level of quantitative
information as to how the hair bundle moves and how this motion shapes the MET receptor current generated.
They will be the standard by which molecular manipulations can be assessed."

Food insecurity—the economic and social condition of inconsistent access to healthy food—is associated with
worse cardiovascular health. Whether food assistance related social policies can improve cardiovascular
health among low-income adults in the US is unknown. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) is the largest US government-funded program providing food assistance. In 2021, at the cost of
approximately $114 billion, 41.5 million Americans received SNAP benefits. As SNAP is administered by
individual states, there are variations in policies related to eligibility assessment and ease of application that
significantly impact participation levels. Although SNAP participation has been associated with improved food
security, poverty reduction, and lower healthcare expenditures, it's impact on cardiovascular health is
unknown. The mechanisms by which SNAP, and poverty reduction programs in general, influence
cardiovascular health is unknown, but may be mediated through mechanisms such as medication adherence
and psychosocial stress. In a previously published analysis, we found that implementation of state level
policies associated with higher SNAP participation was associated with slower growth in diabetes prevalence.
However, whether SNAP participation, or the policies impacting this participation, impacts cardiovascular
health at an individual level is unknown. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of SNAP benefits
received by participants increased, but some of these increases are scheduled to expire. How SNAP benefit
amounts impact cardiovascular health related measures is therefore important to understand. Aim 1 of the
proposed research will use data from a nationally representative survey of older adults – the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) – linked with Medicare or Medicaid administrative claims data to identify whether
SNAP participation among low-income individuals with cardiovascular disease is linked with improvements in
medication adherence and psychosocial stress as well as lower healthcare utilization. Aim 2, using Medicare
and all-payer claims data, will examine whether changes in state-level SNAP policies associated with SNAP
participation lead to changes in the incidence of acute cardiovascular events among low-income adults. We will
also study whether specific policy categories are associated with a greater change in health outcomes. In Aim
3 we will examine how changes in SNAP benefit amounts influence cardiovascular health-related measures.
We will examine the temporary increase in SNAP benefit amounts that occurred nationwide from 2009 to 2013
as a result of the Recovery Act of 2009 and evaluate whether these changes resulted in differences in
medication adherence, healthcare utilization, and health outcomes among SNAP participants with
cardiovascular disease. The proposed research aims will require robust causal inference techniques to
disentangle the effect of SNAP from other potential confounders. This research will provide important insights
to policymakers regarding the potential public health benefits of investments in food assistance programs."

Americans commonly consume excess amounts of dietary fructose. Added fructose has been shown to have an
adverse impact on metabolic health, including increased insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk.
However, the mechanisms that link dietary fructose and metabolic health are poorly understood. Malabsorption
or incomplete metabolism of fructose in the small intestine is common in the population. Excess fructose reaches
the colon where it may change the structure and function of the gut microbiome, alter bacterial metabolites and
trigger inflammatory responses impacting T2D risk. To elucidate whether commonly consumed levels of dietary
fructose influence metabolic outcomes through altering the gut microbiome, we will randomize 30 participants to
a controlled cross-over dietary intervention, in which they will consume 12-day isocaloric, added fructose or
glucose diets (25% of total calories) separated by a 10 day controlled diet washout period. We aim to:
1: Determine the relationships between high fructose consumption, the gut microbiome and metabolic
risk.
2: Characterize the causal role(s) that fructose-induced alterations to the gut microbiome have on
metabolic risk using a germ-free mouse model.
We will measure 1) microbiota community structure and function via metagenomic sequencing of stool, 2) fecal
metabolites via targeted and untargeted metabolomics, 3) anthropometrics, 4) insulin resistance, serum markers
of T2D risk and inflammatory cytokines, 5) fecal microbial carbohydrate oxidation capacity and 6) liver fat via
MRI elastography. We will use novel statistical approaches, including Distributed Lag Modeling, to understand
the complex relationships between diet, the microbiome, metabolites and health outcomes.
We will then conduct controlled dietary interventions and fecal microbiome transplantation studies in germ-free
mice. Donor fecal samples from human participants in both the glucose and fructose arms of the clinical
intervention will be transplanted into germ-free and colonized mice to establish a causal relationship between
fructose-induced changes to the gut microbiome, liver fat and metabolic and inflammatory changes known to
increase risk for T2D.
We aim to comprehensively assess the structural and functional changes to the gut microbiome brought about
by a high fructose diet. Determining the impact of excess fructose on the microbiome will help identify novel
means by which fructose contributes to metabolic disease risk. In addition to identifying strategies to improve
metabolic health in adults, data from this proposal could help inform targeted approaches to mitigate future
disease risk in vulnerable populations that consume high levels of fructose, such as children."

Oral cancer is a highly aggressive and devastating malignancy with a poor prognosis at the advanced stage,
resulting in ~300,000 deaths each year worldwide. Currently no effective targeted therapies are available for oral
cancer; thus, there remains an urgent need to develop new therapeutic options to prevent and treat oral cancer.
ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases playing a major role in
vesicular trafficking. Arf1 is highly expressed and hyperactivated in oral cancer, where it functions as an
oncogenic driver to favor cancer development and progression. As a critical step in the functional cycle of Arf
GTPases is their activation by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ArfGEFs), interrupting the protein-protein
interaction between Arf1 and its specific Arf1GEFs remains an attractive strategy to block Arf1 signaling.
Recently, we have discovered a novel Arf1 inhibitory compound 10b (AI10b) that can structurally mimic the
intrinsic autoinhibitory segment of Arf1GEFs to selectively block Arf1 activation without affecting other Arf family
members. AI10b exhibits a superior anticancer activity in oral cancer cells than other existing Arf1 inhibitors with
no apparent toxicity against normal oral keratinocytes, holding promise to be developed into a safe and effective
targeted therapy for oral cancer patients. Intriguingly, AI10b induces oral cancer cell pyroptosis, a highly
immunogenic form of cell death, and this process requires the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Moreover,
AI10b-mediated regression of GSDMD-positive (GSDMD+) oral tumors is markedly impaired in T cell-deficient
TCRαKO mice and CD8+ T cell-depleted C57BL/6 mice, suggesting the requirement of CD8+ T cells for a
prolonged immune response to AI10b. These novel and significant findings inform our central hypothesis that
AI10b can, in addition to its direct cytotoxic effect, trigger host antitumor immunity to eliminate oral tumors. To
test this, there are three Specific Aims: (1) to elucidate the mechanisms underlying AI10b-mediated pyroptosis
in oral tumors; (2) to dissect the mechanisms by which AI10b-induced oral cancer cell pyroptosis potentiates
antitumor CD8+ T cell immunity; and (3) to develop GSDMD-based differential strategies to augment the efficacy
of AI10b in oral tumors. We will integrate cutting-edge techniques in cancer biology and immunology to attain
our objectives, with a long-term goal to improve the therapeutic efficacy of targeted oral cancer therapy. The
success of this project would be a breakthrough in discovering an impactful treatment that can preferentially
target oral or other tumors with hyperactive Arf1 signaling."

Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a multi-systemic autosomal recessive disorder that is predominantly caused by a
homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutation within the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene leading to a
decrease of protein expression. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism. FRDA is
characterized by ataxia, neurodegeneration, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy. There is no treatment for
this lethal disease. We tested a new therapy for this disease consisting of wildtype (WT) hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation in the Y8GR mouse model of FRDA. This therapy worked beyond
our expectation in FRDA completely correcting the neurologic, muscular and cardiac complications after a single
infusion of HSPCs in lethally irradiated Y8GR mice. We optimized an autologous CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
correction HSPC approach for FRDA and we are now conducting the investigational New Drug-enabling studies
for the clinical translation of this approach. Addressing the mechanism of action, we previously showed that
tissue rescue was at least partly mediated by transfer of frataxin from HSPC-derived microglia-like cells to
diseased neurons. The exact mechanism of rescue including how microglial replacement and frataxin transfer
from microglia-like cells to neurons contributes to this rescue are still unknown. Very few studies investigated
the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of FRDA. We believe that the impressive response of the FXN-
expressing HSPC transplant is due to, not only the transfer of FXN into neurons, but also to the rescue of the
microglial phenotype. The central hypothesis is that these findings in the mouse model are translatable such
that CRISPR-editing of the GAA repeat expansion in HSPCs in FRDA will lead to both functional rescue of
microglia-like cells and transfer of FTX to neurons. Applying a novel cohort of induced pluripotent stem cells from
FRDA patients, controls, and importantly lines created with the proposed gene editing, we find a dramatic
phenotype in FRDA microglia that is corrected by editing. We will utilize novel in vitro and in vivo methods
including patient-derived organoids (mini-brains) and a murine xenotransplantation model of human microglia to
ascertain the microglial contribution to FRDA pathogenesis, the potential for gene editing to correct this
phenotype, and the mechanisms and functional ramifications of FTX transfer to neurons from microglia. . This
project is significant because it provides a human specific platform for disease modeling and validating novel
therapeutic approaches and provides supporting evidence that CRISPR HPSC transplantation can be used to
treat FRDA. It will also advance the understanding of microglia-neuron interactions, and open new perspectives
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases due to mitochondrial dysfunction."

Decades of research have established the importance of early mother-infant interactions for lifelong adaptive social emotional functioning, with implications for the development of later problem behaviors including substance use disorder. A history of maternal sensitivity to infant distress – that is, responses that are consistently contingent, nurturing, and appropriate – is thought to allow infants to internalize socioemotional competencies for maintaining states of emotional security. This is reflected in the development of secure mother-infant attachment and self-regulation behaviors. In turn, mother-infant attachment security is predictive of a
constellation of behaviors in childhood and adolescence – including parent-child and parent-adolescent relationship quality, childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviors, competence with peers, and school success – each of which independently predict substance abuse and substance use disorder. The objective of this proposal is to advance opportunities for research and preventative interventions for the intergenerational transmission of substance use disorders by developing and validating mobile sensor algorithms that can be used to remotely assess maternal sensitivity in both standardized protocols and everyday ecologically valid home interactions. Using audio recorders worn by infants and mother-infant motion and
proximity data, we will develop models that can distinguish sensitive from insensitive maternal responses to infant distress. Critically, we develop our models with “training data” from a diverse sample of families, including families at both high- and low- risk for substance use disorders and who speak both English and Spanish. This will ensure that our tools will benefit the families who need them the most. We envision that future efforts could leverage our algorithms to identify families at greatest need for existing evidence-based interventions to improve maternal sensitivity and child outcomes. Once trained, our algorithms could be integrated into “just in time” interventions to provide real-time feedback and progress reports for mothers participating in interventions. Additionally, these algorithms will be invaluable to research examining the
development of challenges in early caregiving and how such challenges can become amplified over time. For example, these tools could be used to observe the role of difficult infant characteristics, like aversive or excessive crying, maternal stressors or substance use cravings, and maternal support systems, including paternal involvement. As such, the innovative tools produced in the present proposal will both contribute to real-world public health efforts and expand research on the dynamics of early child development."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease with its underlying cause poorly under-
stood. Although many research have been conducted to understand its pathological origin using advanced
imaging technologies, current discoveries have mainly stemmed from studies on microscopic systems with lim-
ited number of cells. While increasingly many evidences have indicated that the interaction among various
groups of cells across the entire nervous system holds the key to those unanswered questions in AD, large-
scale volumetric investigation are limited by current imaging technologies. First, microscale methods used
in conventional histopathology, such as electron or light microscopy, require extensive tissue sectioning for
thick samples, leading to prolonged imaging time and the diﬃculty of 3D reconstruction from 2D images due
to tissue deformation. On the other end, insuﬃcient spatial resolution and limited molecular speciﬁcity of
macroscale approaches, such as MR/PET/CT, have made them less attractive for pathological studies. Thus,
the goal of this project is to develop an optical imaging method that not only provides high resolution and
molecular contrast suitable for the pathology of the nervous systems in AD mouse models, but also oﬀers en-
abling high-throughput for those large-scale investigations demanded by many of today’s AD research. This
proposal plans to address the above imaging needs by creating coherent optical imaging apparatus to pro-
vide the enabling high-throughput and high resolution, by developing new tissue processing methods to oﬀer
the molecular contrast in intact tissues, by building computational tools to assist the biological interpretation
of imaging results. The outcome of the proposed research is expected to be a set of new research tools that
facilitate large-cohort studies on AD mouse models with brain-wide big-data acquisition and analysis. This
mentored project is aimed to facilitate the PI (Dr. Jian Ren) to achieve his goal of obtaining research inde-
pendence. Through the proposed research, the PI will obtain complementary expertise from his mentors, a
team of leading scientists including Dr. Brett Bouma (optical imaging), Dr. Bradley Hyman (neurology and
AD), Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia (nanomedicine and tissue engineering), Dr. Tayyaba Hasan (photodynamic ther-
apy), Dr. Edward Boyden (neuroscience and optogenetics), and Dr. Bruce Fischl (computational neuroimag-
ing and MRI). This combined technical strength will be integrated with training on career development skill,
facilitating the transition of the PI to an independent investigator in the biomedical ﬁeld. The PI will con-
duct this project mainly in the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, which
is surrounded by several world-renowned universities and research institutions in both life and physical sci-
ences. Leveraging the support from the PI’s mentors, he will have access to numerous research facilities at
the greater community of Harvard and MIT. Enjoying this highly multidisciplinary and collaborative research
environment, Dr. Jian Ren will undertake this mentored research and transition to his research independence."

Heart failure (HF) affects more than 6 million adults in the U.S. alone, with increasing prevalence. Cardiovascular
congestion with resultant limitation in physical activity is the hallmark of chronic and decompensated HF. The
current HF physiologic model suggests that congestion is the result of volume retention and, therefore, therapies
(such as diuretics) have generally been targeted at volume overload. Yet therapeutic approaches to reduce
congestion have failed to show significant benefit on clinical outcomes, potentially due to an untargeted approach
of decongestive therapies. Our preliminary work suggested a complimentary contribution of volume redistribution
to the mechanism of cardiac decompensation. We identified the splanchnic nerves as a potential therapeutic
target and showed that short-term interruption of the splanchnic nerve signaling could have favorable effects on
cardiovascular hemodynamics and symptoms.
As part of our proposal, we will: (1) Investigate the impact of prolonged splanchnic nerve blockade on the
cardiovascular system in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); (2) Visualize splanchnic nerves
using intravascular imaging tools, and demonstrate technical success of the splanchnic nerve blockade; and (3)
Define the mechanisms of action of splanchnic nerve blockade and identify congestion phenotypes that respond
favorably to splanchnic nerve blockade.
The results of the proposed scientific aims will help test the paradigm shifting hypothesis of volume redistribution
as a driver of cardiovascular congestion and functional limitations and pave the way for splanchnic nerve
blockade as a novel therapeutic approach to HF."

 New antimicrobial strategies are badly needed, as the spread of antibiotic resistance is rapidly
compromising the effectiveness of current antibiotics. Moreover, new drug development has not kept pace with
the rise of drug-resistant pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is particularly difficult to treat and commonly
found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients or in patients with burn wounds. Due to the emerging antibiotic crisis,
efforts are now focused on finding alternative treatment strategies. Silver-containing compounds represent such
opportunity due to their multi-specific ability to inhibit bacterial growth. One example is silver sulfadiazine, a
topical formulation that is often administered to treat or prevent acute P. aeruginosa wound infections.
 The novel silver containing surface coating AGXX was recently developed as a promising compound with
antimicrobial properties. Composed of the two transition metals silver and ruthenium which form a micro-galvanic
cell, AGXX kills gram-positive bacteria through the formation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen
peroxide. However, its effect on gram-negative bacteria such as P. aeruginosa as well as their responses to
AGXX exposure have not yet been studied. We found that AGXX elicits strong proteotoxic effects in P.
aeruginosa even at sublethal concentrations, and that the compound is significantly more potent than silver
sulfadiazine, the gold standard for the treatment of burn wounds. Moreover, we discovered that the bactericidal
activity of sublethal concentrations of AGXX is up to 50,000-fold higher in the presence of sublethal
aminoglycosides concentrations, indicating a potential application for AGXX as an adjuvant.
 We will now investigate the molecular mechanism behind the synergy of aminoglycoside antibiotics and
AGXX. In Aim 1, we will test our hypothesis that AGXX-induced ROS production disrupts the cellular iron-sulfur
cluster pool and therefore triggers hydroxyl radical production via the Fenton reaction. As a result, we expect to
observe increased membrane disruption, potentially facilitating an elevated aminoglycoside influx into the cell,
which is responsible for increased bacterial killing that is observed after simultaneous treatment of P. aeruginosa
with AGXX and aminoglycosides. Furthermore, we will determine the effect a combinational treatment has on P.
aeruginosa biofilms and persister cells and on isolates of other clinically relevant bacterial species. In Aim 2, we
will use independent unbiased and targeted approaches, including Tnseq and subsequent phenotypic
characterization of transposon mutants, to identify and determine P. aeruginosa-specific responses to and
defenses against AGXX treatment. Moreover, we will assess the cytotoxicity of this compound in different cell
lines of relevance. These findings will guide efforts to devise strategies to implement AGXX as a potential
antimicrobial and adjuvant in eradicating P. aeruginosa infections."

Dominant FBN1 mutations cause Marfan syndrome, an inherited human connective tissue disorder affecting
fibrillin-1 microfibrils and leading to thoracic aortic aneurysms with risk of aortic dissection and rupture. Fibrillin-
1 is a product of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), which provides an important link in the mechanical
continuum from the SMC contractile cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, in addition to providing a template
for elastic fiber assembly. Reduced tissue fibrillin-1 content as a result of FBN1 haploinsufficiency is thought to
be the mechanism underlying a significant proportion (over 1/3) of Marfan syndrome mutations.
In recent work we found that ADAMTS6, a metalloprotease secreted by VSMC, cleaves both fibrillin-1 and
fibrillin-2. The latter is produced primarily during the embryonic period and is thought to have a minor role in the
aorta after birth. Analysis of a mouse Adamts6 null mutant, which does not survive past birth, shows an
accumulation of both fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, with major skeletal and cardiac defects we have genetically
attributed to fibrillin-2 accumulation. Thus, ADAMTS6 appears to be a major protease regulating fibrillin microfibril
turnover. This provides a compelling rationale for targeting ADAMTS6 in Marfan syndrome in a novel disease-
modifying approach.
Based on these findings, the overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that ADAMTS6 inactivation in vascular
smooth muscle cells postnatally will protect aortic fibrillin-1 microfibrils from proteolytic turnover, thus increasing
microfibril abundance and mitigating aortic aneurysm growth and dissection in Marfan syndrome. In Aim 1, we
will use a new Adamts6 conditional mutant to test this hypothesis through conditional deletion of Adamts6 in
VSMCs in a well-characterized mouse model of severe Marfan syndrome that reliably progresses to dissection
and rupture. In Aim 2, we will define the intermolecular interaction of fibrillin-1 and ADAMTS6 to identify the
major molecular determinants of proteolysis. In vitro microfibril assembly will be used to test the impact of
blocking ADAMTS6-fibrillin interactions. These experiments will inform future approaches for protecting
microfibrils from ADAMTS6-mediated turnover.
Impact: A disease-modifying approach for Marfan syndrome does not exists, and non-surgical options have not
been wholly effective in preventing dissection. These aims leverage our initial discovery that ADAMTS6 cleaves
fibrillin-1 for continued investigations intended to drive development of an ADAMTS6 blockade-based disease-
modifying approach for Marfan syndrome. Specifically, the disease mechanism in many patients is reduction of
fibrillin-1 microfibrils and we aim to enhance microfibril abundance by protecting them from breakdown. Together
the aims provide a proof of principle for a possible disease-modifying therapy (Aim 1) and the basis for interfering
with ADAMTS6 cleavage of fibrillin-1 (Aim 2). The work proposed herein also addresses fundamental questions
of how fibrillin-1 is turned over in the vascular wall."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent brain tumor with a very poor prognosis. Currently, despite surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as the standard-of-care treatments, combination of these regimens does not
prolong patient survival significantly. Oncolytic viral therapy opens a new era for solid tumor therapy, especially
for brain tumors. HSV-1 derived oncolytic viruses (oHSVs) are the most advanced type of oncolytic virus (OV)
and the only type of virus that is currently FDA approved in the USA. Very recently, another oHSV (Delytact,
marketed by Daiichi) was granted conditional approval for the treatment of GBM patients in Japan. Thus,
investigating ways to improve oHSV therapy against GBM is highly significant. However, the anti-tumor efficacy
of oncolytic virus (OV) is limited by tumor microenvironment (TME). CD44 signaling regulates GBM TME through
interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) or immune cells. Hyaluronic acid is one of the key extracellular matrix
components derived from glucose metabolites in GBM. CD44 is highly expressed in GBM cells and is a marker
for glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). CD44 also bind to other ligands, such as, osteopontin (OPN), chrondroitin
and proteoglycan to regulate ECM and immune cell function.
Our ongoing experiments show that: 1) CD44 expression in GBM is correlated with poor prognosis of patients,
2) Oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV) intratumoral injection increases HA secretion in brain tumor
xenografts in vivo, 3) oHSV-CD44 significantly downregulates SOX2 and decreases stemness of GSCs, 4)
oHSV-CD44 significantly increases anti-tumor efficacy in vivo, and 5) Combination oHSV-CD44 with an AKT
inhibitor or irradiation could further decrease SOX2 and Nestin expression in GSCs and reduce GSC stemness.
Given these findings, we hypothesize that blocking CD44 signaling in tumor microenvironment (TME) using a
CD44 extracellular domain-secreting oncolytic virus (oHSV-CD44) will not only disable CD44-mediated GBM
growth and lead to immunosuppression but will also inhibit GSC stemness while sensitizing the cells to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The hypothesis will be addressed with the following experiments proposed in
the Specific Aims: 1) Investigate whether combination oHSV-CD44 with an AKT inhibitor reduces GSC stemness
and increases the anti-GBM immune response, and 2) Test whether oHSV-CD44 increases radiotherapy-
mediated anti-GBM efficacy.
The proposed study is significant and has a broad impact on several research areas. In addition to shedding
light on the fundamental understanding of HA-CD44 signaling in GSCs stemness, GBM invasiveness, and
standard-of-care treatment sensitivity, this study will uncover the role of CD44 signaling blockade by oHSV-CD44
in enhanced efficacy of GBM treatment, including chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Furthermore, combination of
oHSV-CD44 with an AKT inhibition or radiotherapy will provide novel treatment strategies for tumor relapse."

Chromosome rearrangements (structural variants) are common in cancer and they drive tumor
development by altering the expression or function of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
by copy number alterations, formation of oncogenic fusions or by alterations of DNA elements
responsible for regulating cancer genes. We have developed an innovative CRISPR-based
approach to specifically target structural variant junctions (SVJs) in cancer cells without harming
normal cells. This approach, called KLIPP, is based on the use of a “split” enzyme approach
consisting of inactivated dCas9 fused to the endonuclease Fok1 (Fok1-dCas9). To activate the
Fok1 endonuclease, two Fok1-dCas9 complexes are brought together at the SVJ using SVJ-
targeting guide RNAs leading to the induction of toxic DNA double strand breaks. We have
obtained strong proof-of-concept for this approach in bladder cancer and other cancer cell
systems both in cell cultures and in vivo. In this proposal we will perform pre-clinical efficacy
testing of the Precision KLIPP Therapy approach in an orthotopic mouse model of bladder
cancer. The premise for targeting bladder cancer with this approach is first, locally invasive
bladder cancer is a common and deadly disease with few impactful therapeutic options.
Second, bladder cancers typically show genomic instability with many hundreds of SVJs that
could be targeted with our approach. Third, the bladder is ideal for local inter-vesicle delivery of
the CRISPR reagents because of the ability to achieve high local concentrations and avoiding
systemic effects. We will in this application pursue three specific aims: Aim #1: CRISPR screen
to map potential Fok1-dCas9 binding toxicity genome-wide. Aim #2: Delivery of CRISPR
reagents to bladder cells in culture. Aim #3: Assessment of efficacy of Precision KLIPP Therapy
in a pre-clinical HGSC mouse model. With this R01 funding, we will be able to advance this
project to the point of planning for human clinical trials."
10776908,"Inflammation negatively affects Tregs stability and suppressive function, impairs the
induction of solid organ transplant tolerance and enhances acute and chronic rejection, leading
to worse recipients’ long-term outcomes. Insights into key inflammatory pathways that suppress
Tregs during allo-immune activation can revolutionize our therapeutic approach to promoting
stable endogenous Tregs.
 Our work strongly suggests that an inflammatory cytokine, macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF), secreted by myeloid cells and alloreactive T cells during rejection and
inflammation binds CD74 (MIF receptor) on the surface of activated Tregs to dampen its function
and homeostasis with opposite effect on alloreactive T cells. We show that inhibiting this novel
pathway either through monoclonal antibodies or genetic deletion promotes immune regulation
and induce exhaustion of alloreactive T cells leading to indefinite heart allograft survival in a
murine fully mismatched model. MIF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced and released
by immune cells, particularly macrophages, and plays an integral role in innate immunity.
However, its role in adaptive immunity is not well known and will be investigated. Our data show
that graft infiltrating Tregs and Teff upregulate their expression of MIF receptor CD74. However,
graft infiltrating myeloid cells and Teff but not Tregs secrete MIF. MIF then binds to CD74 on
Tregs surface to suppress and on Teff to promote their function.
 Our single cell transcriptomic analysis, TCR sequencing, flow cytometry and functional
assays showed that CD74 deficient graft infiltrating Tregs reduced Interferon regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) and shifted toward a more stable Treg phenotype that exhibits superior suppressive ability
in vitro and in vivo. IRF1 is a negative regulator of Foxp3 transcriptional activity that contributes
significantly to Treg instability in the setting of inflammation. Interestingly, CD74 signaling is
exerted through its intracellular-domain (ICD), shown to bind to transcription factors to modulate
gene expression. Recent work identified IRF1 as one of the binding TFs for CD74-ICD13.
 In this application we will test the hypothesis that a novel inflammatory pathway in which
MIF produced by myeloid cells and Teff suppresses Treg function through IRF1 mediated CD74
signaling (SA1), while promoting the Teff function (SA2). We will also develop a clinically relevant
strategy to dampen the MIF mediated inflammatory process in the allograft using anti-CD74
monoclonal antibody generated in our lab (SA3). This anti-mouse CD74 is equivalent to the FDA
approved human anti CD74 (milatuzumab). Hence, this work has high translation potentials."

Multimorbidity involving comorbid mental and medical chronic conditions such as depression and obesity is
highly prevalent among middle-aged and older adults, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities.
Depression and obesity contribute to greater cardiometabolic disease risk (e.g., diabetes), poorer treatment
adherence, and worse quality of life than either condition alone. Both conditions are also risk factors for
Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. Behavioral interventions are traditionally designed to treat
depression and obesity separately; however, few target both conditions. Moreover, scalability of traditional
behavioral interventions is limited, and accessibility is generally poor, especially among racial and ethnic
minorities. Our team previously demonstrated the efficacy of an integrated behavioral intervention for comorbid
depression and obesity, I-CARE, which combined 2 proven treatments: an in-person problem-solving therapy
(PST) for depression and a video-based behavioral weight loss intervention adapted from the Diabetes
Prevention Program (DPP). Recently, we developed and pilot-tested Lumen, a first-of-its-kind, voice-based
virtual coach for PST on Amazon’s Alexa platform. In a pilot randomized clinical trial of predominantly racial
and ethnic minority participants, Lumen demonstrated high feasibility and usability and promising effects on
depression and anxiety symptoms. The objective of the current project is to test the efficacy of a fully digital I-
CARE intervention, combining the Lumen PST virtual coach for depression management with the DPP video-
based program for weight loss. Patients (N=440) self-identified as a racial or ethnic minority with depression
and obesity will be enrolled from a large minority-serving academic medical center in Chicago. In this fully
remote clinical trial, participants will receive a tablet, a wireless weight scale, and a wearable activity tracker.
Participants will be randomly assigned to the digital I-CARE intervention (with 6 months of active treatment and
6 months of maintenance) or waitlist control, and assessed at 6 and 12 months. Controls will receive active
treatment in the digital I-CARE intervention after their assessment at 6 months (primary endpoint). Specific
aims are to (1) determine the intervention effects on the primary depressive symptoms and weight loss
outcomes, and on secondary outcomes (e.g., psychosocial and cognitive functioning); (2) identify predictors of
treatment success, defined by clinically significant weight loss (5%) and depression response (50% symptom
reduction) or remission (free of symptoms); and (3) characterize the experiences and perceptions of
intervention participants to inform future development and translation. The proposed research is innovative,
advancing minority aging research using digital health and focusing on integrated care to reduce depression,
obesity, and related health risks specifically among racial and ethnic minority adults aged 50-74 years. This
work aligns with NIA’s priorities to prevent multimorbidity and reduce health disparities through innovative
interventions to maintain health, well-being, and function."

A woman diagnosed today with an ovarian cancer has only a minimally improved chance of long term survival
compared to a woman diagnosed 40 years ago. Two different yet related observations may provide an
opportunity to improve the outlook of ovarian cancer patients. Both involve DNA damage and repair. 1) The
most effective and widely used drugs, the platinum compounds (cisplatin and carboplatin), lose their
effectiveness over time – drug resistance develops. An important (but not the only) reason for drug resistance
is an acquired ability of ovarian cancers to repair the damage caused by cisplatin DNA adducts. 2) A different
class of drugs that induce DNA damage, the PARP inhibitors, has recently been approved by the FDA for
patients with DNA repair defects, such as germline or acquired mutations in BRACA1/2. Unfortunately,
patients with defects in DNA repair genes represent only a small fraction of ovarian cancer patients.
We propose that targeting the mitochondrial protein sideroflexin 4 (SFXN4) may provide a path to addressing
both these problems. We discovered that reducing the levels of SFXN4 disrupted Fe-S cluster formation in the
mitochondria and cytosol of ovarian cancer cells. We propose that the loss of Fe-S clusters will have major
cellular consequences affecting ovarian cancer. First, reduction of Fe-S proteins will increase oxidative stress
and DNA damage via the acquisition and redistribution of cellular iron. Second, because critical enzymes
involved in NER (nucleotide excision repair) and HRR (homologous recombination repair) require Fe-S clusters
for their function and stability, targeting SFXN4 will reduce the activity of DNA these repair pathways. Given
the possibility that reduction of SFXN4 could both induce DNA damage and inhibit DNA repair, we further
hypothesize that disruption of SFXN4 might enhance the efficacy of platinum-based compounds and expand
the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors to ovarian cancers without defects in DNA repair: i.e., render these
cancers exquisitely sensitive, like BRCA-mutant cells, to platinum-based drugs and PARP inhibitors. In pilot
experiments, we indeed observed that inhibiting SFXN4 1) inhibited DNA repair proteins; 2) enhanced
sensitivity to cisplatin; 3) sensitized ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibitors.
We propose three Specific Aims to study the effects of SFXN4 in ovarian cancer. In Aim 1, we explore how
and to what extent reduction of SFXN4 increases oxidative stress, limits DNA repair and enhances DNA
damage. In Aim 2, we examine the role of targeting SFXN4 in enhancing the effectiveness of both platinum-
based compounds and PARP inhibitors in cell cultures and mouse models. In Aim 3 we determine the precise
molecular site and mechanism by which SFXN4 functions in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and directly link this
effect to the reduction of DNA repair proteins in NER and HRR pathways.
Impact: targeting SFXN4 may represent an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of platinum-based drugs and
extend the use of PARP inhibitors to the majority of ovarian cancer patients with normal DNA repair function."
10774243,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Young adult sexual minority women (SMW), including lesbians and bisexuals, are at
particularly high risk, with up to 4.8 times increased odds of cigarette smoking than heterosexual women; up to
660,000 young adult SMW smoke and are at increased risks of smoking-related cancers and cardiopulmonary
illnesses. Exposure to tobacco industry marketing, minority stressors, alcohol and drug use and social
determinants are key factors linked to increased smoking behavior in this population. Anti-smoking campaigns
utilized inoculation messages (analogous to vaccines) and culturally-tailoring (i.e., LGBT imagery, symbols,
and language) to promote resilience against tobacco marketing influences among LGBT audiences. However,
the effects of culturally tailored inoculation approaches in young adult SMW have not yet been examined. Our
long-term goal is to eliminate smoking-related health disparities among LGBT populations. The objectives of
this study are to determine the effects of using a culturally-tailored inoculation approach to increase resilience
to tobacco marketing influences among young adult SMW and obtain stakeholders' critical inputs that support
later adoption and implementation. Our central hypothesis is that culturally tailored inoculation messages
addressing unique perspectives of young adult SMW will be more effective versus non-tailored messages to
increase resilience to tobacco marketing. The scientific premise is supported by 1) campaigns promoting
resilience against tobacco companies and smoking among LGBT audiences, 2) our pilot study showing young
adult SMW perceive higher relevance, favorable attitudes, and positive emotions toward LGBT imagery
compared to control imagery, and 3) an integrative conceptual framework informed by communication science,
the minority stress framework, and the socioecological model of resilience factors among SMW. Our specific
aims are: 1) Engage with key stakeholders to optimize message construction and collect pilot data to inform
future intervention design, 2) Evaluate the effects of culturally tailored anti-smoking messages on young adult
SMW's smoking and quitting intentions, and 3) Evaluate the effects of inoculation message type, dose, and
latency on young adult SMW's resilience to tobacco marketing, smoking and quitting intentions. We will
conduct twice-yearly meetings, rapid cycle feedback, and key informant interviews with an Expert Advisory
Committee comprising LGBT organization leaders, investigators in sexual and gender minority health,
community members, and national agencies (NCI, CDC, and FDA); message development and testing using
qualitative research methods; and randomized survey experiments. Impact: Findings from this study will
provide the foundation to develop an evidence-based and culturally tailored inoculation approach to increase
resilience to tobacco marketing among young adult SMW and that addresses the needs of future adopters and
implementers. The study methods and findings will further inform research on counter-marketing interventions
to reduce smoking-related health disparities among all sexual and gender minority populations."

Discriminatory housing and zoning policies that cause residential racial segregation, concentrated poverty, and
lack of economic opportunity often result in neighborhood disinvestment and increased neighborhood disorder.
Neighborhood disorder—deterioration of the urban landscape, also known as blight—significantly impacts opioid
misuse, including opioid initiation, injection drug use, opioid use disorder development and duration, and risk of
opioid-involved overdose. Interventions to improve disorder have shown significant positive impacts on
neighborhood crime, gun violence, and mental health. No studies have yet investigated the degree to which
neighborhood disorder interventions influence opioid misuse or associated overdose risk. The broad objective
of this study is to investigate the impact of community infrastructure reinvestment programs on opioid misuse
and opioid overdose. In Philadelphia, government, community, and academic partnerships have resulted in
structural interventions (PHS Philadelphia LandCare and Basic Systems Repair Program) to remediate vacant
lots, abandoned buildings, and dilapidated homes. These programs are designed to improve neighborhood
disorder in resource-deprived, minority-majority neighborhoods with little to no green space and may have distal
effects on opioid misuse and associated overdose risk. Previous Philadelphia studies have shown significant
reductions in crime and improved stress and depression for residents on blocks with blight remediation. This
study will use spatial analysis methods and systematic social observation to address HEAL's RFA DA-23-051
Preventing Opioid Misuse and Co-Occurring Conditions by Intervening on Social Determinants. Specific aims
are: (1) Investigate whether street block-level indicators of opioid misuse differ on blocks with blight remediation
activities using systematic social observation methods for primary data collection of litter from opioid misuse
(e.g., syringes, tourniquets) and harm reduction paraphernalia (e.g., wound care, naloxone); (2) Examine if fatal
and nonfatal opioid overdose rates improved with remediation activities using a longitudinal spatial panel
approach with fatal overdose data from Philadelphia's medical examiner and nonfatal overdose data from
hospital emergency care visits; (3) Explore mechanisms by which remediation activities improve neighborhood
indicators of opioid misuse and fatal and nonfatal overdose rates, including improved community mental health
(measured by BRFSS data) and improved community social capital and social cohesion (measured by primary
data collection of neighborhood structures related to these concepts), using systematic social observation and
spatial analysis methods. This study will examine the impact of highly innovative place-based public health
interventions on opioid misuse and fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose. Findings will provide support for
expanding neighborhood disorder remediation projects in Philadelphia and promote similar public health-based
policy and community-level health interventions for opioid misuse and overdose prevention in other cities."

 Meiosis is the conserved differentiation program that is responsible for gamete formation. As a cell
progress through meiotic differentiation, it undergoes unidirectional changes in cellular structure and function
that are largely driven by gene expression changes. Because the molecular basis for most meiotic transitions
remains mysterious, my lab aims to illuminate the gene regulatory circuitry that programs meiotic
differentiation. We use budding yeast to study this process because well studied meiotic factors are highly
conserved and because this organism uniquely offers access to the large number of highly synchronous cells
that is key to genomic approaches that we routinely employ. Our studies have enabled identification of proteins
involved in key meiotic processes, and new regulatory events during meiosis. These studies have also
uncovered major surprises in the genes that meiotic cells express and how they regulate these genes.
Among these surprises, we found an unconventional mode of gene regulation, involving regulated toggling
between a translatable mRNA isoform and one that is 5’ extended and poorly translated, to be commonly used
to drive meiotic protein levels over time. We have found this mode of regulation to be important in meiosis but
also in other conditions, and a major focus of our research is to better understand how it works. Although we
know that upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are responsible for repressed ORF translation on some
extended mRNA isoforms, we do not know why this is not true of all cases. We will address this question using
reporter experiments, and analysis of mRNA structures and sequences of repressed versus non-repressed
transcripts. We also do not understand how mRNA degradation impacts this regulation and meiotic gene
expression more broadly, which we will study using new metabolic labeling approaches.
 Beyond unconventional regulation of known genes, we also discovered that meiotic cells translate
many genes were not previously identified. These include hundreds of genes that are translated starting with
non-AUG codons, and thousands that are shorter than the 100 codon cutoff that was used to annotate
genomes. We have validated the expression of these non-canonical proteins and are now studying the
molecular mechanisms underlying their synthesis and their specific cellular roles. We are investigating why
non-AUG translation initiation is common in meiosis, primarily using study of candidate regulatory factors that
we have identified. We are performing pooled screens to identify roles for the many short meiotic proteins, and
directed study of cases in which the short proteins include domains of characterized proteins. Together the
projects proposed here will explain how and why meiotic cells employ non-canonical gene regulatory
features, which we believe is critical to unraveling the molecular control of meiotic progression."

Students from groups underrepresented in science often lack actively mentored, sustained research
experiences during their undergraduate years. Absence of direct support and training can be a barrier when
these students pursue advanced biomedical degrees. Ultimately fewer underrepresented individuals hold
doctoral degrees, have careers in biomedicine, thereby exacerbating health disparities in the United States
(U.S.). The objective of this program is to recruit and train at least five participants per year for an intensive,
mentored experience in biomedical research with the goal to prepare them for pursuing a graduate degree in
biomedicine. In preparing scholars to be competitive and successful in graduate programs, we will use a
competency-based educational framework to build their skills in research and self-efficacy. The primary aims of
OHSU PREP are to 1) provide a sustained research-intensive experience to prepare students for graduate
programs with research faculty mentors who have received mentor training to ensure success with this
population of scholars; and 2) provide competency-based professional and career skills development. Scholars
will be paired with a faculty mentor and pursue a year-long independent research project aligned with the
scholar’s interests and receive additional mentorship from the Program Directors and Program Coordinator in
weekly meetings that build their skills and confidence in self-efficacy and professional identity. Each scholar
will develop an individual development plan in order to understand their career and professional development
needs, participate in similar activities as incoming first year PhD students, and take graduate-level courses with
an emphasis on ethics and data analytics. We will offer directed preparation for graduate school, including
graduate school applications, study skills and time management, critical thinking, and resilience. Scholars, with
their mentors, are expected to develop their research projects for presentation at local and national meetings
and prepare a research paper for publication and/or deposition in the OHSU Institutional Repository.
Participants will also receive individualized writing instruction, as well as preparation for the GRE, as needed.
As proposed, OHSU PREP will build on existing opportunities that allow for cultural immersion through
interactions with near-peer mentors (i.e., graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and OHSU faculty from
underrepresented backgrounds. We expect that at least 75% of our participants will successfully enter and
complete graduate programs in biomedical science and that the program will function as a bridge to ease the
transition of recent college graduates into PhD-conferring programs."

 My long-termcareer goal is to establish a research laboratory that dissects functional microcircuits supporting

adaptive behavior in early life. To effectively lead this future research team, I require additional professional

transitions when social demands are in constant flux. Yet, the neural substrates supporting flexible social
behavior during development have been underexplored. The literature and pilot data collected for this proposal
leads me to advance the central hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and its dopaminergic (DA)

this hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will be performed during the mentored phase (K99) and is to

2, initiated during the mentored phase (K99) and completed duringthe independent phase (R00), is to determine
the role of VTA DA release into the BLA in social approach inhibition using convergent approaches to manipulate
and measure DA levels in the BLA. Aim 3, performed during the independent phase (R00), will examine the
relationship between long-range VTA-BLA synchrony and social approach by optogenetically manipulating DA
neurons in the VTA of rats performing a social behavior task while recording spike -LFP synchrony in the VTA
and the BLA. Lack of understanding of the developmental neurobiology underlying social behavior disorders

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well-characterized in terms of cognitive deficits (e.g., executive
function and cognitive control), but defects in perceptual and motor functions are also frequent characteristics of
the condition. These functions present an important avenue for research because perception and action occur
upstream and downstream, respectively, of canonical high-level impairments. Basic research to date has
provided the methodological and theoretical foundations necessary to study these integrated processes, and
several paradigms now exist under an embodied choice framework—describing the processes by which decision
making computations can be revealed through, and retroactively influenced by, movement characteristics (e.g.,
during reaching movements towards competing choices). Many individuals with ADHD exhibit motor
hyperactivity and other motor symptoms (e.g., reaction time variability), making this study well-suited for a better
understanding of the cognition-action pathways underlying psychopathology. Additionally, it has been shown by
work in my co-sponsor’s laboratory (Dr. Julie Schweitzer) that movement can confer cognitive benefits to children
with ADHD performing cognitive control tasks. Aim 1 is an investigation into the potential benefit of movement
conveyed to adults with ADHD during a temporal discrimination task (i.e., a two-alternative forced choice
long/short discrimination of a range of durations). A previous study in our laboratory utilized this paradigm and
showed that healthy young volunteers benefited from concurrent movement during temporal discrimination. In
this Aim, bridging work from my sponsors’ laboratories (Drs. Joiner and Schweitzer), we hypothesize that the
beneficial effect of movement will be larger in individuals with ADHD. In Aim 2, we will observe how movement
reflects the parallel evaluation of two integrated stimulus dimensions that converge on a single choice in a four-
alternative forced choice task. Here the stimulus dimensions map directly onto physical dimensions; the targets
are arranged in a square array equidistant from the start location. This novel task design will allow us to observe
in real-time (via the movement trajectory) the way that stimulus uncertainty and viewing time guide choice. Each
stimulus will always have one high-certainty dimension (i.e., easy) and one low-certainty (i.e., difficult) dimension
(within-subject). We hypothesize that initial movement directions will reflect prioritization of the high-certainty
dimension (i.e., biased toward the relevant Cartesian axis). The task will first be developed in healthy controls
before its application to the ADHD and matched control groups from Aim 1. In the matched ADHD and control
task, we hypothesize that individuals with ADHD will be less effective at prioritizing high-certainty information,
and thus, initial movements will be less likely to cluster around the high certainty axis. This interdisciplinary
project will use methods from motor control and clinical psychology to probe the integrated processes of sensory,
decisional, and motoric characteristics of ADHD that are typically studied in isolation, and may inform diagnostic
and treatment methods to improve the quality of life for people affected by this condition."

10782987,"This TECH core of the U54 Center for Multiparametric Imaging of Tumor Immune Microenvironments (C-MITIE)
will develop an integrated toolkit of advanced imaging and data analysis to power quantitative, mechanistic
investigations of immune-microenvironment dynamics in poor prognosis solid tumors. There is great need for
improved imaging methods that can advance understanding of the physical and molecular mechanisms
governing immune infiltration, distribution, and function in native tumor microenvironments. We propose a
number of multiparametric imaging and computational methods for the two research test beds that seek to define
the physical and molecular barriers to effective anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapies. A major theme of
the TECH approach is to use label-free imaging approaches that can characterize and quantitate the interactions
between immune cells and the tumor microenvironment. These label free methods are largely built on the
platform method of multiphoton microscopy and can be used on intact cell and tissue models with minimal
perturbation. T-cell identity and activation will be tracked by metabolic profiling using new fluorescence lifetime
(FLIM) and hyperdimensional imaging (HDIM) approaches. These metabolically sensitive methods will be
complemented by Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography (FFOCT) to reveal new insight into metabolically
relevant architecture. FLIM based FRET can be used to yield new insights into signaling molecular interactions
relevant to immune-microenvironment dynamics The collagen rich extracellular matrix (ECM) will be queried
with Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging for collagen fiber topology measurement and collagen cross-
linking measurements with Enhanced Backscattering Spectroscopy (EBS). Multiphoton Excitation (MPE)
photochemistry fabrication can be used to create in vitro cell ready models of collagen fiber organization that are
directly based on human data blueprints. Advanced computational analysis methods including algorithmic and
machine learning approaches will be used to examine all multiparametric signals and make correlation between
immune and microenvironment interactions. All imaging and computational methods will be shared not only
widely within the UW and UMN research teams but importantly with the general cancer imaging community using
established hardware and open source software dissemination protocols."
10782990,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an extremely lethal disease with the lowest 1-year and 5-year survival
rates of any cancer. This is due, in part, to the extremely metastatic behavior of pancreas carcinoma cells and
their extreme resistance to both chemical and radiotherapies. Importantly, we now know that a strong, but
nevertheless unique, fibrotic and immunosuppressive stromal response is present in PDA. This intense
fibroinflammatory, or desmoplastic, response is essentially pathognomonic for PDA and limits infiltration of
anti-tumor immune cells and also their ability to move throughout and sample the tumor volume. Indeed,
immunotherapies with immune checkpoint blockade or infusion of genetically modified cells are producing
remarkable clinical responses in other advanced malignancies, but to date, success has been much more
limited in PDA. However, focused preclinical strategies to disrupt the stroma or specifically engineer T cell
therapies have shown promise in PDA. Thus, understanding the physical and molecular basis for native and
engineered T cell infiltration and defining strategies to further enhance their infiltration, migration throughout
tumor masses, and function in cancer will inform cell engineering strategies for improved treatment. Here, we
test a number of focused hypotheses using advanced optical imaging with state-of-the-art in vivo systems,
engineered environments, genome engineering, and mathematical modeling to better define how T cells
successfully move through some environments but are impeded by others. We hypothesize that by defining
design criteria that can be employed to help engineer T cells to move throughout tumor volumes we can
profoundly improve therapeutic efficacy and employ combinations therapies to improve disease outcomes.
Therefore, here, through advanced imaging and quantitative analysis we will dissect physical and molecular
mechanisms governing migration and function of both native and engineered T cells. We will define the roles of
both matrix architecture and immunosuppressive cells populations, and the links between the two. This
information will provide tookits to engineer T cells that most effectively move throughout the entire tumor mass.
Our goals are aligned with the TECH unit, where we will perform iterations between experiments, analysis, and
technology development, and RTB-2 to define approaches to improve therapy in poor prognosis cancers.
Collectively, we seek to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of immune cell migration and define approaches to
transform cell engineering therapies to eradicate cancer."
10782993,"Abstract
Brain tumors remain among the most malignant and deadly cancers, with adult glioblastoma (GBM) having a
median survival of 15 months and five-year survival of less than 10 percent (Stupp et al., 2009), despite surgery,
chemotherapy (temozolomide), and radiation. While each of these approaches provides an overall survival
benefit of a few months, they do not offer a longer-term survival benefit or cure, even in combination. Thus, new
therapy approaches are sorely needed. To rationally develop therapies, it is critical that we have better
experimental systems for both fundamental and preclinical investigations that faithfully recapitulate key features
of the human disease while bringing the full power of state-of-the-art engineering approaches to bear including
modeling and simulation. In unpublished work, we have found that the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase system
we developed can be used to produce two major GBM, proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES), in immune-
competent wild-type mice using known human oncogenic drivers of glioblastoma, and that individual cancer cells
can be tracked in live tumors via multichannel fluorescence imaging. We hypothesize that mechanical forces
mediate a key targetable difference between PN and MES subtypes, and that the immune cold/hot signatures of
PN and MES subtypes represents a second key targetable difference between subtypes. To test these
hypotheses, we will measure cellular force and signaling dynamics of cancer cells and T cells in live GBM tumors
(Aim 1) and Measure immune cell dynamics in live GBM tumors (Aim 2). In particular we will measure cell traction
forces, kinase and GEF signaling, and extracellular matrix architecture in live tumors and brain tissue. In addition,
we will track antitumoral T cells, and protumoral microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, and their
correlations with each other and GBM cells, in the SB mouse models of PN and MES. These experiments will
be used to parameterize the Cell Migration Simulator (CMS) and Brownian Dynamics Tumor Simulator (BDTS)
to create predictive models that are GBM subtype-specific. In most cases, these measurements will be the first
of their kind in live GBM tumors, and will inform cell and tumor scale biophysical models. In so doing, RTB2 will
be providing a state-of-the-art integrated experimental-computational testbed for development of imaging
modalities in the TECH unit."

Project 1 will test the overall hypothesis that Proton Radiotherapy delivered in ultra-fast dose rates (>60
Gy/sec), termed FLASH-PRT, controls Pancreatic tumor growth equally well as Standard dose rate (<1
Gy/sec) Proton Radiotherapy (S-PRT), while sparing normal intestinal tissue from acute and delayed toxicity.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to better mechanistic understanding of the differential
effects of F-PRT compared to S-PRT at the molecular, genetic and organismic level and will define the
parameters necessary for the initiation of clinical trials. In preliminary published studies, we demonstrated that
compared to S-PRT, F-PRT increases overall survival of model mouse models and also ameliorates late stage
toxicity, primarily fibrosis. At the same time, F-PRT was shown to be equipotent to S-PRT in controlling the
growth of allografted syngeneic tumors. Studies using single-cell RNA- sequencing (scRNAseq), reveal
intriguing differences in gene expression profiles in the response of epithelial stem/progenitor cells to F-PRT
compared to S-PRT which coincide with a reduction in the inhibitory effect on progenitor cell proliferation. In
Aim 1, we will define the dosimetric and biophysical parameters which deliver maximum normal tissue sparing
and anti-tumor effect of F-PRT using syngeneic flank and orthotopic models and Genetically Engineered
Mouse model (GEMM) of PanCa. We will then link perform
a dose-escalation study using these optimized
parameters and focal RT to determine in F-PRT improves overall survival compared to S-PRT
. In Aim 2, we
will delineate the mechanism of differential response of normal intestinal and liver tissues including epithelium,
vascular, immune and
circulating
cells to S-PRT and F-PRT, using scRNAseq to deconvolute the differential
patterns of gene expression elicited by the two modalities. In Aim 3, we will use GEMM with tissue-specific
deletion of p53 (epithelium vs. endothelium) to investigate the role of epithelial and endothelial cells
respectively, in the response to S-PRT and F-PRT on acute and late toxicity coupled with reduced epithelial
barrier loss.
We will also test the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin and R-Spondin signaling in mediating F-
PRT sparing of normal intestinal epithelium
. This project will benefit from, and contribute to, conceptual
advances in the other projects. Information garnered from scRNA-seq will inform experiments on skin toxicity
and progenitor cell fate in Project 2, including the canine trial on sarcoma. Results from epithelial-specific and
endothelial-specific p53 knockout mice in this project will guide experiments in Projects 2 and Project 3 in
sarcoma and lung. Project 3 will generate Carbon and Proton-irradiated intestinal and PanCa samples which
will be analyzed by Project 1. Finally, Project 4 will develop a pencil-beam scanning approach which we will
employ in the dose-escalation experiments under Aim 1."
10781320,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite treatment advances over the past decade, metastatic prostate cancer (PC) remains a fatal disease. As
such, there is an acute need for additional treatment options. The development of therapeutics that specifically
target cell surface antigens represent an attractive approach. PSMA is a cell surface glycoprotein that is highly
expressed on PC and because PSMA is relatively restricted to prostatic tissues, it represents an ideal theranostic
target (i.e. useful for both ‘therapy’ and ‘diagnostics’). 177Lu-PSMA-617, a PSMA-directed radioligand, was
recently approved by the FDA. While this is clearly a welcome treatment option, the median PFS has been
reported to be <9 months and objective responses only occur in ~50% of patients. As such, strategies to augment
the efficacy of PSMA-directed therapies are needed. Given that pre-clinical and clinical data has shown that
high, uniform expression of PSMA is associated with optimal outcomes, one approach to augment the activity of
177Lu-PSMA-617 would be to administer a drug shown to increase PSMA expression.
 Our preliminary data from the University of Washington Rapid Autopsy (UW-RA) program has shown that
a substantial proportion of men who die from metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) harbor tumors that
have minimal to no PSMA expression. Mechanistic studies exploring the mediators of PSMA expression have
demonstrated that epigenetic modifications represent key regulators of PSMA expression, with DNA
hypermethylation of the FOLH1 (PSMA gene) and closed chromatin states associated with PSMA negative
tumors. Importantly, we have demonstrated that the epigenetic changes resulting in PSMA repression are
reversible and treatment with a variety of HDAC inhibitors results in robust increases in PSMA expression in vitro
and in vivo.
 In this proposal we will conduct a first in field clinical trial testing a novel epigenetic ‘priming’ strategy
designed to increase PSMA expression. We will use innovative technologies and unique biospecimens to refine
our priming strategy and develop iterative approaches to maximize clinical benefit to PSMA-directed therapies.
In Aim 1 we will evaluate the effect of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat on PSMA expression as determined by
PSMA PET imaging. We will also conduct detailed correlative work to assess imaging, blood and tissue-based
predictive biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will refine our epigenetic ‘priming’ strategy and conduct preclinical studies
that will inform iterative clinical trials. Finally, in Aim 3 we will utilize the UW-RA program to collect metastatic
tissue from men who died from mCRPC and received 177Lu-PSMA-617. This will enable us to determine other
regulators of PSMA expression and determine mechanisms of resistance to 177Lu-PSMA-617. Importantly,
because these patients will also have baseline PSMA and FDG-PET imaging, we will be able to evaluate the
dependency of PET imaging features on molecular phenotype. Collectively, these studies will be important to
guide the clinical development of PSMA theranostics and will provide novel approaches to overcome primary
and secondary resistance to PSMA-directed therapies."
10783019,"The goal of our proposal is to develop new approaches for the prevention and treatment of human malaria
caused by the parasite Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax). This type of malaria, known as vivax malaria, is the most
widely distributed type of malaria with 3.3 billion people at risk and at least 15 million clinical cases worldwide
each year. As the most common form of malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa, it can cause severe illness and
death across a large segment of the world's population. Most individuals exposed to P. vivax through repeated
infection gain partial immunity over time. The immunity is mediated, in part, by acquired antibodies (Abs) to
essential parasite proteins that can block the parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells thereby preventing
infection and if infected reduce the risk of disease. This proposal aims to isolate human monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) from individuals with immunity to vivax malaria that recognize a few key molecules known to be
essential for invasion of liver and red blood cells. Once isolated these mAbs will be evaluated as to whether
they block parasite invasion of liver and red cells in vitro, and in vivo using murine models and genetically
modified parasites. Monoclonal Abs with potent blocking activity will be further characterized as to exactly how
and where they interact with parasite proteins and whether individuals in diverse populations also have the
same or similar antibodies. This information can be used to help to design a vaccine against vivax malaria.
These mAbs can also be used for treatment of severely ill patients, or for prevention of vivax malaria over time,
since a single injection of modified mAbs can last for weeks and even months."
10781749,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cell fate decisions occur during embryonic development, morphogenesis, and cell reprogramming. These wide-
spread cellular changes include launching global gene expression programs that are controlled by pioneer
transcription factors (PTFs) which serve as the master regulators of cell fate. Manipulating PTFs is a
fundamental building block for regenerative medicine, while the dysregulation of PTFs is linked to the
development of cancer. PTFs are special since they can recognize their cognate DNA sequence motifs on both
naked DNA and the DNA wrapped into the nucleosomes that form chromatin. The ability of PTFs to bind DNA
sequences within chromatin is thought to facilitate nucleosome unwrapping, either directly or by recruiting
additional factors, to start the transcription programs. The detailed processes that permit PTFs to recognize
cognate sequence motifs on naked DNA or nucleosomes as well as the mechanics of PTFs once bound to
nucleosomes are largely unknown. Perhaps more importantly, PTFs operate on very long genomic regions
containing clusters of imperfect sequence recognition motifs. Removing these clusters destabilizes cell fates in
vivo. However, the function(s) of these imperfect recognition motifs remains a puzzle.
We propose to examine the mechanics of PTF recognition progressions using the Engrailed and Wor1 as models
for high-resolution biophysical analysis. Engrailed is present in all higher order organisms and plays an essential
role in body patterning. Wor1 drives the White-to-Opaque cell switch of Candida albicans, the agent of common
human invasive fungal infections. The White-to-Opaque cell switch, which affects virulence and niche selection
in clinical candidiasis, is controlled by an easily manipulated genetic circuit in vivo.
Our previous and preliminary studies demonstrate that the Engrailed DNA binding domain (enHD) is highly
promiscuous in the recognition of cognate DNA sequences. Moreover, enHD appears to be a fast but
heterogeneous DNA scanner and undergoes a significant conformational transition when it binds to a high-affinity
cognate motif. It is our overarching hypothesis that imperfect-motif clusters organize regions in active DNA and
chromatin where PTFs home in on via heterogeneous scanning and promiscuous recognition, and ultimately act
on via binding-induced conformational transitions.
We have implemented advanced single-molecule detection systems to resolve PTF-DNA dynamic interactions
with µsec resolution at nm precision. These techniques will be used to address the following Specific Aims: 1)
Dissect the EnHD and WOPR sequence recognition code for DNA and nucleosomes, 2) Resolve the dynamic
scanning and mechanical interaction between EnHD and WOPR with imperfect-motif clustered DNA, and 3)
Examine Wor1 interaction dynamics with the White-to-Opaque master regulatory element of C. albicans in vitro
and in vivo. The proposed studies will detail the DNA recognition processes used by PTFs that lead to cell fate
decisions involved in tissue patterning, morphogenesis, cancer, and cellular reprogramming."

In this proposal, we will define the effects of epigenetic dysregulation via Stag2 loss on three-dimensional
chromatin structure and gene expression. We will define key lineage-specific chromatin features and validate
their hierarchy in differentiation in contrast to stem cell self-renewal. In Aim 1, we will perform low-input Hi-ChIP
assay on Ctcf (loop/TAD-boundary), Rad21 (pan-cohesin loop), ChIP assay for H3K27Ac (enhancer) and RNA-
seq (gene expression) on phenotypically defined mouse and human stem and progenitors to define population-
specific looping events. Using our novel ‘on-off-on’ dual recombinase (Stag2GL) allele, we will first determine if
the restoration of Stag2 can reverse the effects on self-renewal/differentiation and define chromatin loops 1)
perturbed during Stag2 loss and 2) restored after Stag2 reversion. Locus-specific functional assays will
determine the key events required for self-renewal through in vitro studies to phenocopy in ‘Stag2-on' or prevent
reversion in ‘Stag2-off’. In Aim 2, using our low cell input Hi-C and Hi-ChIP techniques to assess chromatin loops
alterations identified in our fully penetrant Stag2/Flt3 co-mutant AML models in combination with the Stag2GL
allele. Using a multi-omics approach, we will define the chromatin landscape of Flt3 with and without the
antecedent Stag2 mutation. We have created a well-annotated MDS and AML patient biorepository, as well as
a biorepository of healthy bone marrow from hip arthroplasty patients. Using these primary patient samples, we
will map chromatin loops and transcriptional output in stem and progenitor populations and intersect lineage-
specific interactions in human and mouse. Functional validation of chromatin loops lost or gained in the co-
mutant models will be assessed in vitro, prioritizing loci identified in primary AML patient samples. Stag2
reversion in this system will definitively determine whether Stag2 is required for the maintenance of AML and
capability for chromatin reversibility, hereby representing a genetic dependency in Stag2-mutant AML. Finally,
these mouse models and serially passaging patient derived xenograft resources will constitute the systems to
assess the effects of Stag2 loss on therapeutic response to standard chemotherapeutic regimens (cytarabine
and doxorubicin) as well as to emerging targeted therapies such as FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-ITD mutant AML
(gilteritinib). Taken together, the results of this proposal will elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism of
Stag2, leading to a deeper understanding of 1) epigenetic mechanisms of chromatin remodeling on
transcriptional regulation, epigenetic plasticity, 2) the contributions of Stag2 loss towards tumorigenesis in MDS
and secondary AML and 3) identification of key novel therapeutic targets."
10746069,"The serotonin (5HT) system has been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-induced mood
disorders, such as anxiety and major depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most
widely used antidepressants for treating these disorders. Strongly linked to both mood disorders and the
efficacy of SSRI treatment is the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process of generating new
neurons from neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the adult dentate gyrus (DG). Importantly, stress, mood
disorders, and SSRI treatment have all been shown to alter the 5HT system and influence adult hippocampal
neurogenesis, suggesting that 5HT signaling is critical for regulating this process. Currently, we have limited
understanding of serotonergic regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, largely due to the broad action of
5HT on the neurogenic niche and lack of information on the expression patterns of 5HT receptors in adult-born
cells. Identification of cell-type specific expression of 5HT receptors is challenging because 5HT is capable of
binding to 14 distinct 5HT receptor subtypes. To fill these gaps in our understanding, we performed preliminary
studies and demonstrated that functional 5HT1A receptors (5HT1ARs) are expressed early in adult NPCs,
including type 1 neural stem cells and type 2a early neural progenitors. Strikingly, the functional 5HT1ARs in
NPCs are only found in female (but not male) mice. Supporting sex-dependent expression of 5HT1ARs in
NPCs, we found that selective deletion of 5HT1ARs in adult NPCs leads to a significant reduction of newborn
cells derived from NPCs only in females (not males). These results suggest that expression of 5HT1ARs in
NPCs are required for proper lineage progression of NPCs in a sex-dependent manner. These interesting
findings sparked several immediate directions we propose to pursue: In Aim 1, we will examine cell-autonomous and sex-dependent contributions of 5HT1ARs to early neurogenic responses induced by external
and serotonergic circuit stimuli; In Aim 2, we will investigate the causal role of membrane potential in regulating
development of normal and 5HT1AR-deficient adult NPCs; In Aim 3, we will examine the role of 5HT1AR-deleted newborn neurons in hippocampal network activity and hippocampus-dependent behavior."
10745962,"Cholesterol is continually acquired by de novo synthesis or from the diet and must be metabolized or excreted in order to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. In vertebrate animals, cholesterol can be actively excreted via members of the ATP-binding cassette G (ABCG) subfamily. In the liver, cholesterol is secreted into bile by a heterodimer of ABCG5 and ABCG8 (G5G8). In the intestine, G5G8 limits the absorption of dietary sterols. Inactivation of G5 or G8 causes sitosterolemia, a recessive disorder associated with sterol accumulation and premature atherosclerosis. Another ABCG family member, ABCG1 (G1) also transports cholesterol. Unlike G5/G8, G1 functions as a homodimer and promotes the export of phospholipids and sphingomyelin, as well as cholesterol, from cells. G1 participates in the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues, where is it synthesized, through the circulation to the liver for excretion into bile. The overall goal of our research program is to determine how G5G8 and G1 promote the translocation of neutral sterols across biological membranes. In the last funding period, we used X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (EM) to obtain high-resolution structures of nucleotide-free G5G8 with its cholesterol substrate at 2.7-3.0 Å resolution and both nucleotide-free and ATP-bound G1 at 3.1-3.7Å resolution. These results provided the first insights into the basic structure-function mechanisms of ABCG transporters and formed the basis of this grant application, which is designed to address 3 fundamental questions: 1) How do the conformations of G1 and G5G8 change during the transport cycle, and how do these changes relate to sterol translocation? 2) How do G1 and G5G8 recognize highly insoluble neutral sterols that are embedded in lipid bilayers and what accounts for the substrate specificity of the two transporters? And 3) How is substrate binding related to ATPase activity, and what is the structural basis for substrate-stimulated ATPase activity? Each of these questions is organized as a Specific Aim. The studies proposed take advantage of new developments in cryo-EM, our expertise in functional reconstitution of polytopic membrane proteins in vivo and in vitro, and our discovery of missense mutations in G5 and G8 with very specific effects on G5G8 and G1 function (e.g. large changes in substrate specificity or ATPase activity) that provide unique mechanistic insights. We have marshalled the reagents and expertise required to ensure successful completion of the studies proposed. Elucidation of the transport mechanisms of G1 and G5G8 will reveal how cells and organisms efflux lipids and maintain sterol balance, thus preventing two common disorders: coronary artery disease (CAD) and gallstones."
10755750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the deadliest form of breast cancer, affects Black/African
American women at twice the rate of white women. Additionally, the survival rate for TNBC is lower in
Black/African women. To address the disparities associated with TNBC we need broadly applicable targeted
therapies. Without targeted therapies, clinicians are left with chemotherapy, which has many negative side-
effects and in many cases is ultimately ineffective in the treatment of TNBC. We have observed that a subset
of TNBC cell lines are dependent on the expression of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR). ADAR
is an enzyme that converts adenosine nucleotides in RNA to inosine in a process known as A-to-I editing. Loss
of ADAR inhibits cellular proliferation and tumor formation for a subset of TNBC cell lines. Because ADAR is
required for the growth of some TNBC cell lines it serves as a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of
TNBC. It has been observed that ADAR-dependent cell lines have elevated interferon signaling, potentially
making it possible to classify ADAR-dependent tumors. Interferon signaling is higher in Black/African American
breast tumors than tumors in white patients, which may make therapies targeting ADAR more effective for
Black/African American patients. There are aspects of ADAR-dependence that we do not understand. For
instance, we do not understand why some cells are dependent on ADAR expression while others are not. Here
we will explore the mechanism of ADAR-dependency and develop a strategy for treatment of TNBC based on
ADAR inhibition. In AIM 1 we will identify the factors that are required for ADAR-dependence, including
identification of the immunogenic RNAs that contribute to the phenotype caused by ADAR depletion. In AIM 2
we will develop and assess a classification model to predict which tumors will be sensitive to ADAR inhibition.
The accuracy of the classification model will be evaluated by knockdown of ADAR in patient derived xenograft
models of TNBC. Importantly this AIM will provide the PI with training in mouse models of breast cancer,
including tumor implantation and monitoring. Finally, in AIM 3, we will develop a high-throughput A-to-I editing
assay and use it to identify a small molecule inhibitor of ADAR. In addition to the potential identification of a
small molecule inhibitor of ADAR, this AIM will provide the PI with experience developing a high-throughput
screen and the use of DNA-encoded chemical libraries. This work will advance our understanding of ADAR-
dependency such that we can accurately classify ADAR-dependent TNBC, thus opening the door to treating
this deadly form of breast cancer with the small molecules identified in AIM 3. Developing an effective targeted
therapy for TNBC is essential to reducing the disparate effects of this disease on Black/African American
women. Finally, the research and career development training included in this grant will facilitate the PIs
transition into an independent investigator."
10780787,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The mesothelium is an overlooked cell type that is also ubiquitous: it is the most external cell layer that
encapsulates all internal organs and lines the body cavities. The best-known canonical function of the
mesothelium is to produce lubricant to facilitate organ sliding past each other and the body wall. The
mesothelium is composed of a single layer of large and flat squamous epithelial cells that is derived from the
mesoderm lineage. In the lung, aside from being the site of asbestos-induced mesothelioma, the role of this
fundamental cell layer in lung development and injury repair is poorly understood, and is the focus of this
study.
 Our entry point to studying the mesothelium is Myelin Regulatory Factor (MYRF), a transcription factor.
Variants in the MYRF gene have been identified in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) patients. CDH
carries a high mortality rate at birth largely due to respiratory distress. In the lung, MYRF is expressed in the
mesothelial cells and alveolar type I cells, two large and flat cell types of the mesenchyme and epithelium,
respectively. In mice, while inactivation of Myrf in the lung epithelium led to no discernable phenotypes,
inactivation of Myrf in the mesenchyme led to a clear CDH phenotype, including organ herniation, lung
hypoplasia and lethality at birth. Later inactivation of Myrf bypassed embryonic lethality, revealing a striking
subpleural fibrosis phenotype in the postnatal lung. In the adult, bleomycin treatment of these mutant lungs led
to exaggerated injury compared to control, implicating subpleural myofibroblasts as a possible contributor to
fibrosis progression. In this study, we will use MYRF as an entry point to investigate mesothelium function as a
signaling center in lung growth (Aim 1), as an active barrier in homeostasis (Aim 2), and as an instigator of
pathogenesis in lung repair (Aim 3). Our findings will delineate the fundamental role of the mesothelium and its
quintessential transcription driver MYRF in lung development, homeostasis, injury and repair."
10780931,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Emerging adulthood (18-25 years of age) represents a critical developmental window for lifestyle intervention
given high rates of obesity, proinflammatory behaviors (e.g., dysregulated sleep, intake of highly processed
foods, declines in physical activity), life stressors, and psychological symptoms—all of which serve to perpetuate
chronic low-level inflammation, thereby increasing risk for cardiometabolic disease and many cancers. Despite
this, few behavioral obesity management interventions have developed specifically for emerging adults (EA).
Those that do exist have produced modest treatment effects, with EA women experiencing considerably less
benefit than EA men. EA women are also at disproportionate risk for psychological dysregulation in the form of
depressive symptoms and psychological stress. Further, our preliminary data suggest that exposure to life
events, insufficient sleep, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms interfere with weight loss treatment
response in this population. Importantly, this does not appear to be driven by differences in self-regulation
behaviors; rather, we posit that the cognitive processing required for effective self-regulation is disrupted by
inflammatory cytokine activity. Extant behavioral weight loss programs are insufficient to address this underlying
behavioral/psychological dysregulation, and do not promote behavior change through the lens of inflammation.
Thus, a new intervention model is needed to optimize clinical impact in this high-risk population. Our overarching
hypothesis is that explicitly targeting psychological functioning and proinflammatory behaviors could not only
enhance weight loss outcomes, but also confer greater improvements in inflammation and cardiometabolic
health among EA women than those achieved by weight loss alone. We developed and tested an integrated
lifestyle intervention (ILI) in a single arm proof-of-concept trial and observed clinically and statistically significant
improvements in depression, anxiety, perceived stress, as well as weight. ILI consisted of BWL content adapted
to meet the needs of EAs with an increased focus on changing discrete behaviors linked to inflammation in the
absence of calorie goals, all intertwined with training in empirically-supported strategies to improve psychological
function (e.g., cognitive restructuring, distress tolerance). Building upon these promising results, we propose a
pilot randomized clinical trial of ILI compared to our developmentally adapted behavioral weight loss (BWL). We
will recruit 32 EA women age 18-25 with BMI 25-50kg/m2 and randomize them to ILI or BWL. All participants will
receive digital tools to facilitate self-monitoring and contact schedule will be identical between arms—the initial
4-month program will consist of group sessions via Zoom (8 weekly, 4 bi-weekly) with weekly tailored e-coaching,
followed by monthly boosters through 12 months. Assessments will occur at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months to assess the
preliminary efficacy of ILI to improve adiposity (Aim 1) and biomarkers of inflammation and cardiometabolic risk
(Aim 2), and to explore putative psychological mechanisms of action (Aim 3)."
10760277,"Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), a highly transmissible infection, is common and endemic throughout the world. Similar
to other human herpesviruses (HHV), HSV-1 maintains lifelong latency inside host that requires immune evasion through
various sophisticated mechanisms. Although HSV-1 is equipped with large repertoire (>80) of protein coding genes, the
commonly accepted manifestations of viral gene expression during latency are the accumulation of a noncoding
transcript and a set of microRNAs (miR). HSV-1 encoded viral miRNAs (v-miRs) are demonstrated to control expression of
both viral and host transcripts and regulate viral tropism, lytic switching, immune subversion, etc. While multiple studies
have examined HSV-1 profiles in various cell lines, key biological functions of these v-miRs remain unknown. Therefore,
we propose to evaluate: (1) systematic expression dynamics of v-miRs during disease progression and reactivation, (2)
comprehensive role in the pathogenesis by perturbing immune cells functions and (3) therapeutic targeting of v-miR by
synthetic oligonucleotides to mitigate HSV-1-mediated ocular herpes. Using our established mouse model of ocular
herpes, we will compare HSV-1 miRNA profiles in primary and reactivated mice corneal tissues and blood. Identifying
positive and negative regulatory v-miRs can yield novel insights into host-virus interaction. The information gained will
be used in designing therapeutic v-miR Inhibitors to silence candidate v-miRs functions. Effect of synthetic
oligonucleotides (v-miR Inhibitors) targeting candidate v-miRs will be assessed on ocular disease progression in a mice
model. V-miR inhibitors (alone or in combination) will be topically delivered and virus release, viral transcript/genome,
and disease severity score will be measured. Next, we will evaluate how v-miRs can render host immune system
dysfunctional, an integral feature required for HSV-1 persistence. Using v-miR inhibitors, we will assess whether immune
infiltration and functions can be restored in vivo. Immune cell subsets will be comprehensively profiled in virus-infected
animals treated with v-miR inhibitor using flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing. In addition, transcript
expression profiles of genes related to antigen processing/presentation pathway, critical for potent antiviral response,
will be quantified. This will identify the in vivo mechanisms through which v-miRs can facilitate immune evasion in ocular
tissues. Next, we will dissect underlying mechanisms of v-miR-mediated dysregulation of antigen
processing/presentation by macrophages and dendritic cells and activation of T cells. V-miR expressing myeloid cells will
be assessed for uptake and processing of viral antigens and activation of autologous T helper (CD4+) and T cytotoxic
(CD8+) cells. In addition, we will assess the impact of v-miRs on the polarization of CD4+ T cells. The data generated will
provide significant information to existing knowledge gaps. Overall, the proposed translational study focuses on
identifying the therapeutic and mechanistic aspect of v-miRs in ocular disease pathogenesis through modulation of
immune cell responses."

Candida albicans is uniquely associated as a commensal component of the microbiota of most
humans, without harm to most of us, yet it causes a range of infections from mild to life-
threatening, based on the immune status of the host. The interaction between C. albicans and
mammalian phagocytes is critical, and the Candida-macrophage co-culture has become a
valuable model to uncover specific adaptations that promote virulence and commensalism. To
further probe the novel biology of this interaction, we used transcriptional profiling to identify
fungal genes induced upon phagocytosis. While some of these have recognizable functions,
mostly in metabolism (a known response to phagocytosis), more than half the induced genes
are uncharacterized and not widely conserved. A surprising number of these genes are quite
small and missed in early annotations. Given the uniqueness of the C. albicans-human
association, this set of genes is likely enriched for adaptations of C. albicans to host niches. In
proof of this principle, we have mutated three of these genes and all three have host-relevant
phenotypes, with one as a novel cell wall-associated microadhesin required for adhesion to
biotic and abiotic surfaces and for virulence in mouse models. We propose that it clusters
conventional adhesins into heterogeneous complexes on the cell surface that strengthens
binding to substrates. Two others have antioxidant properties, again despite being quite small
proteins (68 and 99 amino acids). These are therefore unique mediators of functions
appreciated to be critical for Candida virulence (adhesion and oxidative stress resistance). We
propose studies to discern the mechanistic details underlying both phenotypes. Based on the
successes of our preliminary genetic analysis, we propose a larger-scale effort to generate a
mutant library of all of the uncharacterized macrophage-induced genes and test them in multiple
in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays. The strength of this proposal is in our expertise in analyzing
this critical host-pathogen interaction, our thorough genetic methods and screening protocols,
and the use of multiple animal models. The innovative potential is significant given the focus on
novel genes and novel biology at the host-pathogen interface. The outcome of this proposal is
a deeper and broader understanding of the genetic functions that are required for
commensalism and pathogenicity in fungi."
10934542,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease cause significant mortality, with
stark inequities impacting racially and ethnically minoritized populations. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a
rapid shift in chronic disease management to telehealth-based care, including patient portals, telemedicine
video visits, and remote patient monitoring. However, there are substantial racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
disparities in health IT access for chronic disease management in the United States. This is due to patient-level
barriers such as inequitable device and internet access and lower digital literacy, as well as clinic-level barriers
such as inadequate support to access digital technologies and skills, inequitable offering of health IT, and a
lack of equity-focused, stratified telehealth data. Increasing telehealth use among minority populations has the
potential to lessen disparities in chronic disease health outcomes.
We propose a 2x2 randomized controlled trial entitled “Achieving Chronic Care equiTy by leVerAging the
Telehealth Ecosystem” (ACCTiVATE), in which we will examine the impact of a multi-level intervention that
tackles patient-level and clinic-level barriers to increase the equitable use of health IT for chronic disease
management. The patient-level intervention combines the role of digital health navigator and chronic disease
health coach to facilitate access to devices and broadband, offer digital skills training, and provide chronic
disease health coaching focused on telehealth modalities. The clinic-level intervention includes Practice
Facilitation with a learning collaborative, clinic-specific Community Advisory Boards, and electronic “Telehealth
Equity Dashboards” that display telehealth utilization stratified by race/ethnicity.
We will randomize 600 English- and Spanish-speaking adults with uncontrolled hypertension across 10
federally qualified health centers to digital coaching versus usual care. The 10 health centers will be
randomized to Practice Facilitation versus usual care. In Aim 1, we will assess the impact of the multi-level
intervention (coaching combined with practice facilitation, and each arm alone) on systolic blood pressure
(primary outcome), hemoglobin A1c, and microalbuminuria overall, and among Black and Latinx patients. In
Aim 2, we will assess impacts on process measures of telehealth disease management (digital literacy,
medication adherence, engagement with health IT). In Aim 3, we will conduct a mixed methods evaluation of
implementation by applying the RE-AIM framework to identify key features needed for successful adoption and
dissemination by healthcare networks. A multidisciplinary Stakeholder Advisory Board will advise on all Aims.
The proposed intervention recognizes the multilevel determinants that have perpetuated the digital divide,
worsening chronic disease care during the pandemic. The impact of this intervention will result in an efficient,
user-centered multilevel intervention for improved telehealth engagement, medication adherence, and digital
literacy, which are all key drivers of improved chronic disease outcomes."
10764927,"Bioengineering Experience for Science Teachers “BEST” Program
ABSTRACT
The Bioengineering Experience for Science Teachers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was
first offered in 2016 to provide a collaborative summer research opportunity for Chicago Public
School (CPS) pre-engineering and science teachers. Under the guidance of faculty from the
College of Engineering and College of Education, teachers participate in a bioengineering research
lab and use the experience to create a curriculum for their own classrooms. The goal of the BEST
program is to enhance the skills of urban public high school science teachers and enable them to
more effectively communicate the nature of bioengineering to their students. Teachers can choose
among diverse research opportunities in rehabilitation engineering, bionanomaterials, biomedical
imaging, microfluidics, biomaterials, and regenerative medicine. The BEST program places six
teachers in bioengineering research laboratories and employs a Community of Practice model to
support development of bioengineering curricula for use in the teachers’ classrooms. This proposal
plan enhances the BEST program by expanding the analysis to evaluate curriculum improvement
from a pre-program baseline, evaluating teachers in the classroom during curriculum
implementation, and strengthened avenues for BEST teachers to disseminate their experience and
curricula to a broader audience. The BEST program is scaffolded to support the development of
appropriate teaching materials of bioengineering content which translates scientific knowledge into
specific curriculum maps, instructional materials, and classroom assessments that are aligned with
Common Core State Standards CCSS and Next Generation Science Standards NGSS. As it has
been widely shown that teacher influence can be a significant factor in student career interests, the
BEST program aims to provide effective professional development to increase teacher’s
bioengineering content and pedagogical knowledge to ultimately increase the pipeline of
bioengineers."

The Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) at the University of Michigan seeks to develop
a new postdoctoral T32 training program to prepare early-stage postdoctoral fellows for careers in translational
science and research. This two-year program emphasizes training in interdisciplinary team science that crosses
departments and disease states. Recruitment centers on non-clinically trained basic scientists from biomedical,
social, or data science disciplines, with particular focus on individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented
in translational science. We also endeavor to recruit doctoral-level allied health professionals (e.g., postdoctoral
individuals trained in nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, and social work) that traditionally have had few
options for advanced translational research training. Five trainees are appointed per year. Each trainee has a
structured mentoring team that guides their professional and scientific development. This team includes Scientific
Mentors, a MICHR Advocate from a different field that serves as a neutral third party, and a Near-Peer Mentor.
Trainees and their mentoring team undergo didactic mentor training. Through the following Specific Aims, this
program works synergistically and purposefully with our K12 and predoctoral programs to fully integrate with
MICHR's mission to improve the lives of individuals and their communities through clinical and translational
research: 1) Provide postdoctoral trainees with precision preparation for a career in translational science,
including training on the fundamental characteristics of a translational scientist, participation in a Translational
Immersion Experience with patients, clinicians, and/or policymakers to improve their understanding of the
conditions they study, and through participation in the MICHR Career Development Studio, training in leadership
and practical skills required to obtain and manage a research program; 2) Strengthen and expand the
professional networks of postdoctoral trainees through networking and team science training, one-on-one
interviewing assignments, and frequent networking opportunities with leading content experts; and 3) Prepare
postdoctoral trainees to be versatile communicators with training in critical verbal and visual communication
skills, including communicating via social media and with the press, and participation in MICHR Writing Squads
and its K Writing Workshop to hone their written communication skills. Trainees and mentors also participate in
our new UM1 Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accountable Leadership in Clinical and Translational Science
initiative (IDEAL-CTS). Trainees will have access to the MICHR Implementation ToolBox, a suite of educational
materials to support protocol implementation, and our M-COMPASS career development platform that provides
trainees with self-paced training modules for incorporation into individual development plans. Our expected
outcome is a postdoctoral T32 program that better prepares and equips trainees for long-term success in
conducting translational research and becoming strong leaders within diverse scientific communities that impact
human health."
10765639,"Abstract
While we have made significant progress toward malaria eradication, further attempts are hampered by the fact
that little is known about the basic cellular biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. In
the asexual stage, where the parasite replicates in red blood cells and causes malaria’s characteristic cyclical
fevers, a contractile ring structure known as the basal complex is required for replication and serves to separate
budding daughter cells. I have identified a member of the basal complex that is essential for parasite growth and
division, PfPPPP8, and acts as a serine-threonine phosphatase. PfPPP8 is the only basal complex protein with
known enzymatic activity, and I believe PfPPP8 is essential to drive the formation and organization of the basal
complex during asexual division. To determine whether its phosphatase activity makes PfPPP8 essential, I aim
to use genetic complementation. I will use CRISPR-Cas9 to insert an exogenous copy of PfPPP8, with mutations
in predicted key catalytic residues, into a PfPPP8 inducible knockdown line, knock down the endogenous copy,
and determine the impact of each mutation on parasite growth and division. To further characterize PfPPP8’s
role in division, I will perform quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in the same inducible knockdown line and
identify PfPPP8’s enzymatic substrates. These substrates will themselves be genetically modified with an
epitope tag and a knockdown system so their localization throughout Plasmodium division can be visualized and
the phenotypic consequences of their absence can be compared to the PfPPP8 knockdown phenotype.
To identify novel basal complex proteins using PfPPP8, I performed immunoprecipitation on PfPPP8 and another
epitope tagged basal complex protein PfCINCH in the PfPPP8 inducible knockdown background. I will select
proteins which, based on their absence or depletion in the PfPPP8 knockdown condition, are likely to be
uncharacterized members of the basal complex, prioritizing those which are predicted to be essential, and
introduce similar genetic modifications as the putative substrates to determine if they also localize to and are
required for the formation of the basal complex. I will also similarly select and examine top candidate proteins
only present in the PfPPP8 pulldown, which are likely to be specifically relevant to PfPPP8, in order to further
characterize PfPPP8’s mechanism of action and role within the parasite throughout division. Because PfPPP8
is essential to Plasmodium growth and replication during the pathogenic stage and because it is conserved only
among Plasmodium species, further study could prove it a useful new target for developing antimalarials in the
face of rising resistance to extant drugs."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) represent the most common
causes of dementia (cognition decline that leads to a loss of independent function) among adults.
Approximately 1 in 9 Americans age 65 and over (11%) lives with dementia from AD, representing
approximately 6.5 million people; prevalence rates increase when including related dementias. There are
currently no treatments that prevent or halt the progression of dementia, although the 6 FDA-approved
medications can help slow symptoms. Living with AD/ADRD is associated with loss of independence, disability,
poor health and well-being (morbidity), and increased mortality. The care needs for people living with dementia
(PLWD) are complex. Providing care is associated with high costs and considerable caregiver burden. There
are also considerable health disparities for PLWD from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Thus, there is an
immediate need to identify novel, accessible, culturally relevant, and cost-effective approaches to reduce the
burden and improve quality of life for older adults living with these common neurodegenerative diseases
without a cure. We have known for over 35 years that people living with AD can meaningfully engage with
music, even into the late stages. An increasing number of studies conclude that PLWD who participate in
music therapy or music-based interventions (MBIs) experience improvements in quality of life, and emotional
well-being as well as decreases in behavior issues, anxiety, and depression. Despite these promising findings,
the number of studies is small, many are low quality, samples lack diversity, and the underlying mechanisms
are not yet well understood. In addition, little is known about potential benefits of MBIs for people living with
related dementias (ADRD). Studies using the NIH Stage Model and Science of Behavior Change methods can
help improve study quality and provide a framework for developing and testing MBIs in the context of
AD/ADRD. Moreover, use of novel mobile body-brain imaging (MoBI) technologies could help elucidate how
MBIs affect various functions of the brain (including neuromodulation) and body in real-world settings. To
accelerate rigorous research about the mechanisms by which MBIs impact health and well-being for adults
with AD/ADRD, we will create the multi-disciplinary Research Network to Accelerate Mechanistic Studies of
Music for Dementia (RN-MusD). The Network, representing experts from cognitive neuroscience, music
therapy, biomedical and neural engineering, geriatrics, and statistics will create three core nodes at the
University of California San Francisco, University of Houston, and Arizona State University. The Network will
accelerate rigorous, multi-disciplinary, and mechanistic studies of MBIs in the context of AD/ADRD by
accomplishing the following aims: (1) build a collaborative Network that will grow over time; (2) promote
multidisciplinary collaborations through a pilot project program, leveraging MoBI and research mentoring, and
(3) disseminate resources generated by our Network to sustain impact."
10778493,"The obesity epidemic will affect 1 in 2 adults in the US by 2030. While several medical and surgical weight
reduction strategies are available, with newer, transformative medications recently approved, little is known
about their safety and effectiveness in clinical practice. Real-world evidence (RWE) studies based on routinely
generated health insurance claims from millions of patients have the size and the breadth of data capture
needed to provide critical information on the safety and effectiveness of weight loss strategies in clinical
practice, complementing evidence from RCTs. In this setting, however, the adiposity measure that guides
weight loss treatment, i.e., body mass index (BMI), although captured with high specificity, is often missing.
Yet, BMI information is necessary to accurately identify study populations, adjust for confounding, and assess
effect modification on a large scale in claims data. Similarly, confounding and other biases may be present
in RWE studies. Thus, identifying methodological approaches that increase the validity of RWE studies
comparing weight loss strategies is critical to generate unbiased findings that can validly address questions not
answered or answerable by RCTs. Our overarching goal is to develop, implement, and test approaches
to produce large scale, high-quality RWE on the comparative safety and effectiveness of medical and
surgical weight loss strategies to complement RCTs. To achieve this goal, we will leverage (1) the Nurses’
Health Studies (NHS) I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), large longitudinal cohort
studies with rich lifestyle and dietary data, linked with their insurance claims data, and (2) large U.S. national
(federal and commercial) claims databases, resulting in a heretofore untapped new data infrastructure. We will
improve existing algorithms to measure BMI in national claims data using primary data from longitudinal cohort
studies (NHS I and II, and HPFS) linked with their claims data (Aim 1); assess the success of approaches to
reduce confounding, including comparator choice and propensity score adjustment, with respect to measures
of achieved comparability between medical and surgical weight loss strategies identified in claims-based RWE
studies with regard to information only measured in the linked data (Aim 2); evaluate when RWE studies of
weight reduction strategies emulating target trials provide causal conclusions (Aim 3); and fill gaps in the RCT
evidence in targeted questions regarding the safety and effectiveness of medical and surgical weight reduction
strategies in clinical practice (Aim 4). This work will develop more accurate, methodologically rigorous
approaches to conduct RWE studies of weight reduction strategies using large scale, real-world data
and will create an invaluable infrastructure to conduct studies on the comparative safety and
effectiveness of various cardiometabolic treatments."
10778494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vascular calcification is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to mortality.
Calciprotein particles (CPPs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic target. In CKD, excess CPPs build up
in the blood and transform into pathogenic forms—primary and secondary CPPs, which have been shown in
preclinical studies to cause vascular calcification by inducing inflammation, dysfunction of endothelial cells, and
calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells. Whether and how serum CPPs lead to vascular calcification in
CKD patients is an important knowledge gap. Our study will help fill this gap by testing the hypothesis that
serum CPPs from CKD patients lead to macro-calcification, micro-calcification, and calcification of human
vascular smooth muscle cells. Because vascular calcification resembles bone mineralization, agents that
inhibit vascular calcification may adversely affect bone formation. By studying the function of vascular cells, our
proposal provides mechanistic insight that may serve as a basis for future CPP-related therapies to attenuate
vascular calcification without impacting bone health. At a cellular level, vascular smooth muscle cells in arterial
media and endothelial cells in the intima play pivotal roles in vascular calcification. Vascular smooth muscle
cells undergo osteogenic differentiation, a process that initiates mineralization in the vessel walls; and
endothelial cells can regulate this process. Macro- and micro-calcification confer different cardiovascular risks,
and studying micro-calcification allows for early detection and intervention. Using our novel methods of
measuring serum CPP size and quantity, we will test our hypothesis in 3 aims. Aim 1 will determine the
association between serum CPPs and macro-calcification in coronary arteries by leveraging the Chronic Renal
Insufficiency Cohort, which has stored serum and assessment of macro-calcification in coronary arteries by
computed tomography (n=780). We will measure serum CPP size and quantity in these serum samples. We
will also measure serum markers for endothelial function corresponding to nitric oxide production, activation,
hemostasis, and inflammation, and determine whether these markers mediate the association between CPPs
and calcification. Aim 2 will determine the association between serum CPPs and micro-calcification of aorta in
a prospective longitudinal study of 60 patients with CKD stage 4. We will measure serum CPP size and
quantity in these patients, and quantify micro-calcification of aorta using 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission
tomography at both baseline and Year 1. Aim 3 will define the effects of CPPs derived from CKD patients on
human primary vascular cells. We will generate CPPs from the serum of CKD patients recruited in Aim 2, and
test their effects on calcification of human smooth muscle cells, function of endothelial cells, and endothelial-
smooth muscle cell paracrine mechanism. We expect that CPPs induce calcification of smooth muscle cells,
and endothelial cells exposed to CPPs exacerbate this effect. By defining the effects of serum CPP on
vascular calcification, the results will inform the development of future CPP-targeted interventions."

The prevalence of pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is escalating in US youth, particularly in
those of Latino ancestry. NAFLD in children is associated with poor long-term outcomes, including diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and higher liver-related morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Despite the clinical
significance of pediatric NAFLD, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are poorly understood. This lack
of knowledge is a major obstacle to the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies. Emerging
studies support a role for extracellular vesicles (EVs) in NAFLD. Circulating EVs can influence intracellular
signaling, tissue injury and repair, and matrix remodeling in liver cells. Plasma EV levels discriminate between
adult patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and are positively correlated with
histological grade. We conducted a series of proof-of-principle studies that demonstrate: 1) distinctive protein
signatures in plasma EVs isolated from Latino children with NAFLD, 2) NAFLD-specific signatures approximate
non-NAFLD signatures following lifestyle intervention that reduced liver fat, and 3) isolation of hepatocyte-
specific EVs showed enrichment of liver-specific proteins in NAFLD. To date, however, investigations of EVs in
pediatric NAFLD are scarce, and the role of EV-derived cargo in NAFLD pathogenesis in youth remains unknown.
Here we propose a strategy to characterize the biological role of EVs in pediatric NAFLD. In Aim 1, we will apply
unbiased methods to study proteins and RNAs carried in circulating and hepatocyte-enriched EVs to derive
characteristic signatures associated with NAFLD and NASH in Latino youth. In Aim 2, we will measure EV
concentration and content in youth with NAFLD who experienced changes in hepatic fat fraction following two
distinct intervention modalities (i.e., intensive lifestyle and bariatric surgery). Importantly in Aim 3, we propose a
series of molecular experiments to obtain mechanistic insight into the functional aspects of EV cargo. The
combination of these approaches is innovative; and the strategy comprises a novel and sequentially appropriate
set of aims that has not previously been used to address potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in pediatric
NAFLD. The focus on children is especially impactful due to the growing prevalence of NAFLD in this population,
the association of pediatric NAFLD with poor health outcomes in adulthood, and the expected future economic
burden to care for these individuals. The focus on Latino children as an underrepresented yet growing population
demographic is critical, because at every stage of life and along the entire NAFLD spectrum, Latinos experience
a disproportionate burden of disease. The identification of EV-derived cargo associated with pediatric NAFLD
will enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis, provide a
means to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and identify new targets for potential drug development."

Influenza A virus is a seasonal pathogen with the potential to unpredictably cause devastating pandemics.
Influenza has a broad tropism within the respiratory tract infecting many different subsets of epithelial cells.
These epithelial cells are the primary target of influenza infection and are responsible for amplifying and
spreading the infection. These cells are also critical sentinels detecting the virus and initiating antiviral immune
responses. It is difficult to determine early replication events because it is hard to label infected cells rapidly
after infection. Additionally, the virus spreads within the lung making it difficult to disentangle low replication
levels from new infections. To overcome these caveats, we used a single cycle reporter system that robustly
labels infected cells and is restricted to the first cell types infected. Our preliminary data demonstrate that cells
supporting different levels of virus replication express distinct sets of interferon-stimulated genes. These data
demonstrate that the antiviral response is tuned to level of replication. Using a sequential infection strategy
where the single cycle viruses express discrete fluorophores to specifically label primary and secondary
infected cells we have demonstrated that ciliated epithelial cells are specifically protected during the second
wave of virus replication. These data demonstrate that virus tropism is significantly shaped by innate immune
responses during virus dissemination. The objective of this research is to determine responses that inhibit
influenza virus replication and to determine how virus tropism is altered during innate immune responses in
vivo. Our central hypothesis is that cellular responses to infection become tailored to the stages of viral
replication and the round of infection which impacts overall viral replication levels and cellular tropism. Our
studies will address this hypothesis through use of a combination of reporter viruses that can determine the
degree, stage, and round of replication to elucidate fundamental antiviral processes in vivo. We will address
this hypothesis in two aims. Aim 1 will be to determine how varying levels of replication induce unique ISGs
and the role of the resulting effector proteins in the antiviral response. Aim 2 will focus on elucidating the
mechanisms of protection of epithelial cell subsets during virus spread. Results from this proposal will uncover
fundamental mechanisms in virus-host interactions and antiviral immunity."

Current cancer therapeutic vaccines that utilize both CD4 and CD8 T cell neoantigens to stimulate T cell immunity
through dendritic cell/macrophage-mediated antigen presentation for their anticancer efficacy. However, despite
some promising results in certain cancer types (e.g. melanoma) in preclinical and clinical studies, most of these
vaccines have yet to achieve long-term efficacy across different types of cancers. In contrast, the role of B cell
immunity in cancer vaccines has been a subject of debate for several decades, and thus therapeutic cancer
vaccines have not traditionally been designed to activate B cell immunity. However, recent clinical studies have
suggested that B cell-antigen-presentation-mediated B/CD4 T cell crosstalk is crucial for durable anticancer
efficacy in immunotherapy. However, most current neoantigen cancer vaccines do not activate B cell-antigen-
presentation-mediated B/CD4 T cell crosstalk due to (A) these vaccines, containing only CD4/CD8 T cell
epitopes, without B cell epitopes, could not promote B cell-mediated antigen presentation for B/CD4 T cell
crosstalk. (B) these vaccine do not have optimized delivery system to enhance B cell epitope binding/crosslink
with B cell receptor (BCR) that is required for B cells to uptake antigen for presentation to CD4 T cells. As
evidenced by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that VAM-B/CD4 neoantigen vaccine enhances B cell-
mediated antigen presentation, activates B/CD4 T cell crosstalk, promotes long-term neoantigen-specific
memory B/CD4/CD8 T cell immunity, and achieves durable anticancer efficacy. In addition, our preliminary data
also suggest that B/CD4 crosstalk by VAM-B/CD4 is more important for its durable anticancer efficacy than B
cell epitope induced antibody production. Therefore, we further hypothesize that a “promiscuous” viral B cell
epitope in VAM-B (viral) /CD4 (neoantigen) could promote its binding/crosslink with BCR, which enhances B cell-
mediated antigen presentation to activate the required B/CD4 T cell crosstalk for durable anticancer efficacy.
This proposal is innovative because VAM-B/CD4 neoantigen vaccine stimulates B cell antigen-presentation-
mediated B/CD4 T cell crosstalk and promotes long-term antigen-specific B/CD4/CD8 T cell memory for durable
anticancer efficacy. This is distinct from the current T cell cancer vaccine using CD4/CD8 epitope through
DC/macrophage mediated-antigen presentation. (B) VAM-B/CD4 uses viral antigen cluster mimicry topography
to enhance binding to BCR, promote BCR crosslink, B cell uptake of antigens, and B cell mediated antigen
presentation. This is distinct from other nano delivery systems that promote DC/macrophage-mediated uptake
and antigen presentation. (C) VAM-B/CD4 vaccine could also use ""promiscuous"" viral B cell epitopes and cancer
neoantigen to promote B/CD4 crosstalk. This project may have significantly positive impact to achieve long-term
durable anticancer efficacy in many types of cancers."
10775381,"Environmental issues like exposure to air pollution or pesticides and their link with cancer development are at
the forefront of current public health research. Animals have long been recognized as sentinels for environmental
pollutants that can be hazardous for human health. Interestingly, and despite the fact that domestic animals like
horses and dogs share comparable habitats, and thus, are exposed to similar environmental risk factors as
humans, their susceptibility to develop certain types of cancer, like mammary cancer, differs greatly. The
overarching goal of this research is to use a comparative species approach to identify the responses of horses
(a species resistant to mammary cancer) and dogs (a species susceptible to mammary cancer) to environmental
carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are linked with increased breast cancer risk.
Published work from our lab has shown that equine mammary cells undergo apoptosis while canine mammary
cells continue to proliferate when exposed to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA), a synthetic PAH
derivate commonly used to induce mammary cancer in rodents. These data led to our hypothesis that mammary
cancer-proof mammals eliminate DNA-damaged cells through apoptosis, while damaged cells from mammary
cancer-susceptible mammals are repaired and persist, allowing for the accumulation of potential malignant
mutations. However, it is difficult to test this hypothesis in vivo due to logistical challenges of treating horses and
dogs with DMBA. To address this, we established a mammary xenograft model by transplanting mammary tissue
fragments from equine or canine donors into the cleared mammary fat pads of immunodeficient mice. We
confirmed that these transplanted tissue fragments are proliferative, hormone-responsive, and recapitulate the
architecture and function of the donor gland. We now propose to use this novel model to assess the effects of
DMBA on equine and canine mammary xenografts to further evaluate mammary cancer resistance and
susceptibility mechanisms in vivo. Following DMBA treatment, the mammary xenografts will be assessed for
histopathological features, DNA damage, and necrotic/mitotic rate. Activation of apoptotic and tumor-associated
pathways will be assessed using a spatial transcriptomics approach, which maintains spatial context of the tissue
while providing complete transcriptomic data. Successful outcome of this proposal will (i) improve our
understanding of histopathological responses of mammary glands from sentinel species to DMBA and (ii)
corroborate whether increased apoptosis is indeed a mechanism driving mammary cancer resistance in equine
mammary glands. Evaluation of this potentially conserved mechanism of mammary cancer resistance in
response to PAH exposure will help define important regulatory mechanisms that can ultimately result in the
identification of biomarkers of exposure and breast cancer risk."

Neuroinflammation is a key component to the establishment and progression of
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We recently identified a novel
pathway called LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO) and found it is important for mitigating
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in a model of AD. We have robust preliminary
evidence demonstrating that LANDO functions to suppress inflammatory signaling in microglia,
the resident innate immune cells in the brain. Activation of LANDO facilitates the recycling of
receptors that recognize β-amyloid, a contributor to AD pathology. Abrogation of LANDO results
in a severe exacerbation of all markers of AD including not only β-amyloid deposition, but
increased tau pathology, neuronal loss, and memory impairment. Furthermore, targeting
inflammatory signaling in LANDO-deficiency is able to almost fully inhibit neuronal death while
restoring microglial function and improving memory. However, the mechanisms that control
LANDO in microglia and ultimately link LANDO to inflammatory signaling are unknown. We
provide convincing evidence that components of retromer machinery including VPS35 and
Rab11b are essential for LANDO, however are dispensable for related pathways including
autophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis. Additionally, we provide evidence that suggests
LANDO alters inflammatory activation through restriction of inflammasome assembly and
decreases pro-inflammatory reactive oxygen species levels. We further provide data that
suggests abrogation of upstream LANDO activation and its role in inflammatory mechanisms
leads to diverse programs of neuronal cell death including putative roles for the necroptotic
machinery in both death and inflammation. We propose to use a variety of novel animal models
and assays we have established to evaluate LANDO regulation, inflammation, and neuronal death
at both the molecular and physiological levels in AD. These studies will provide new opportunities
for the manipulation and development of therapeutic methodologies for AD in addition to
increasing our understanding of this complex, multifaceted biological system."
10774644,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall aim of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to
provide Dr. Gex with the training and research activities needed to become an independent investigator. Her
program of research will focus on developing and delivering novel brief interventions for problematic substance
use and increasing accessibility and uptake of efficacious interventions. Cannabis is the most widely used
federally illicit substance among emerging adults (age 18-25) in the U.S., and frequent cannabis use is
associated with myriad long-term consequences. Despite this, rates of perceived risk of daily/regular cannabis
use have steadily declined over the past two decades. Several cannabis brief interventions have been developed
and tested to date; however, meta-analyses indicate that the evidence for efficacy is mixed and that the quality
of studies is low, suggesting that novel and more rigorous approaches are necessary. The proposed project will
employ the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development to develop and test the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a novel brief intervention. In addition, cannabis-specific candidate
mechanisms of behavior change will be explored, including motives for use, protective behavioral strategies,
consideration of future consequences, and proportional substance-free/-related reinforcement. This innovative
proposal includes training activities to ensure that Dr. Gex achieves the following new career goals: (1) Develop
expertise in the assessment and prevention of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder; (2) Receive training in
the development and evaluation of behavioral interventions by (2a) Enhancing qualitative and mixed methods
research skills and (2b) Receiving advanced training in the design and implementation of clinical intervention
trials; (3) Develop expertise in the science of mechanisms of behavior change; and (4) Enhance skills in scientific
and grant writing and professional development. Under the mentorship of a multidisciplinary team of outstanding
investigators (Drs. Kevin Gray, Rachel Tomko, and Shannon Phillips at the Medical University of South Carolina,
Dr. Christine Lee at the University of Washington, and Dr. Ben Ladd at Washington State University), the
candidate will develop and evaluate a novel in-person brief intervention addressing frequent cannabis use in
emerging adults. The combination of outstanding mentorship, hands-on experiences, and didactics and formal
coursework afforded by the proposed K23 award will significantly enhance the candidate’s career development
in patient-oriented research focused on the prevention and early intervention of substance use disorders in
emerging adults and will provide a valuable training experience and critical preliminary data to support future R-
series applications. This K23 application is directly responsive to NIDA’s Strategic Plan to develop new and
improved strategies to reduce cannabis use and prevent long-term consequences, specifically to develop and
test innovative prevention interventions that target relevant mechanisms underlying salient risk factors."
10863886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Late-stage, HPV-negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (or HNC-) is the most lethal form of
HNSCC. HNC- occurs at the highest incidence in the Appalachian region, where a large segment of this population is rural,
economically disadvantaged and medically underserved. The Appalachian population is the highest user of tobacco in the
nation, a behavior directly linked to disparities in HNC- incidence and mortality. As such, there is a pressing need to identify
the underlying genomic mechanisms responsible for the disparate survival in tobacco-positive Appalachian HNC- patients
as an essential step towards improving medical outcomes for these patients. Single gene informatic analysis of national
cohorts has identified elevated copies of multiple genes associated with smoking. The majority of these genes map to
chromosome 11q13 cytobands, the most commonly amplified region in HNC- and long known to be associated with
reduced survival. 13 smoking-correlated genes overexpressed from the 11q13 amplicon correspond with decreased
survival, increased risk of death and elevated risk of lymph node metastasis. While some genes in this region have been
well studied as drivers of HNC- progression, other genes identified by this analysis have unknown roles in cancer and may
present new targets for therapeutic intervention. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the roles of
uncharacterized genes from the smoking-associated expression signature (SAES) in the 11q13 amplicon that contribute to
neoplastic progression of Appalachian tobacco-positive HNC-. Our central hypothesis is that overexpression of novel
11q13 genes in the SAES contribute in driving reduced Appalachian HPV-survival. Oncogenic screening of uncharacterized
SAES genes will be conducted to evaluate the individual contributions of each gene in promoting cancer hallmarks. SAES
gene function will be assessed using cultured cells from Appalachian tobacco-positive patients and mouse orthotopic
HNSCC models. Aim 1 will test the role of SAES genes in driving tumor cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metabolic
reprogramming in tobacco-induced 11q13 amplified HNC-. Aim 2 will utilize experimental and clinically-parallel imaging
modalities to individually evaluate novel predicted drivers of lymph node metastasis. These genes will be tested for
promoting tumor cell growth, nodal spread, altered metabolism and proliferation in 11q13 amplified Appalachian HNC-
tumors. A comprehensive understanding of how each novel SAES gene contributes to enhancing this aggressive HPV-
subtype will fill a key gap in our knowledge regarding how the 11q13 amplicon contributes to the overall poor outcomes
seen in tobacco-associated HNC-. Results from this proposal will provide a foundation for future studies that will
mechanistically address novel tumor-promoting SAES genes identified from this work as drivers of disease aggressiveness,
potentially serving as new targets for therapeutic development and/or biomarkers to improve treatment of this highly
refractory disease in the Appalachian population."
10883713,"To translate the rapid progress in neurological therapeutic developments to patient care, clinical trials must keep pace with preclinical discoveries. Hurdles encountered in neuroscience clinical trials include delays in regulatory approvals, slow recruitment, participants lost to follow-up and slow translation of findings to clinical practice. The University of Pittsburgh has unique and significant resources and a proven track record of excellent performance in clinical trials, and in NeuroNEXT in particular. The aims of the proposed NINDS Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Trials at the University of Pittsburgh (NEXT-UP) are: (1) to continue and enhance an effective administrative structure with the capacity to rapidly implement NeuroNEXT trials across the wide range of neurological conditions; (2) to foster collaboration and outreach in NeuroNEXT trials among academic physicians, community physicians, patients and patient support groups; and (3) to promote careers in clinical trial research by integrating clinical research training of early-stage investigators with NEXT- UP activities and pair them with effective mentoring. The NEXT-UP leadership plan reflects these goals with a Program Director (Paula R. Clemens, MD); an Advisory Board incorporating expertise and liaison to adult and pediatric neurology clinicians and patients; an early stage investigator; and a Program Coordinator. Collaboration will be established by meeting regularly and outreach to providers and the community. Recruitment will occur through high-volume referral providers and community outreach. Efficiency and monitoring will be accomplished through use of a central IRB and standardized trial agreements; establishing a timeline and benchmarks for each trial; monthly reports to the NEXT-UP Leadership from co-Investigators; and Corrective Action plans for challenges encountered. Promotion of careers in clinical trial research will include a training plan for early stage clinical neuroscience investigators. The combination of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s regional dominance in healthcare, resources from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) at the University of Pittsburgh and this innovative proposal will allow NEXT-UP to continue to be a model site in the NeuroNEXT network with efficiently run clinical trials integrating investigators with community providers, patients and trainees."
10909291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Postpartum breast cancer (PPBC), defined as breast cancer diagnosed within 10 years after a women's
last childbirth, accounts for 50% of young women's breast cancer cases. PPBC patients have a 52% 5-year
survival rate, whereas age-matched non-PPBC patients have an 80% 5-year survival rate. In rodent studies,
supported by patient data, PPBC cases have a greater affinity to progress to overt metastasis after a diagnosis
of locally contained disease. Specifically, we find that stage I-III PPBC patients progress to liver metastasis
more often than non-PPBC patients. Liver metastasis is a devastating prognosis with only a 3–15-month
median survival rate. In rodent models and humans, weaning-induced mammary gland involution has been
shown to be a niche that supports establishment of circulating tumor cells in the PPBC patient, and eventual
progression to overt metastatic disease. Rodent studies, supported by human studies, show evidence that the
liver undergoes remodeling post-weaning, much like the mammary gland. Rodent models of PPBC liver
metastasis, support that this remodeling, known as liver involution, establishes a pro-tumor environment, and
may account for the increased liver metastasis seen in PPBC patients. This proposal seeks to understand
mechanisms by which liver involution supports the liver metastasis niche. Specifically, the proposed aims will
explore the role of liver fibroblasts in establishing a unique pre-metastatic niche in the postpartum period during
weaning-induced liver involution. While pro-tumor involution fibroblasts have been reported in the mammary
gland, it is unknown if liver fibroblasts differentially respond to environmental cues during involution or if they
contribute to the establishment of a pro-metastatic niche. Aim 1 will identify and describe distinct populations of
fibroblasts across a reproductive cycle using single-cell RNAseq and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC).
Liver fibroblast populations will then be functionally tested to investigate if involution liver fibroblasts are tumor
promotional.
 During the K00 phase I will transition into understanding liver fibroblasts in the establishment of liver pre-
metastatic niches in breast and pancreatic cancer, with a focus on fibroblast-immune cell-crosstalk. Little is
known about how liver fibroblasts respond to tumor education of the pre-metastatic niche. My K00 proposal will
investigate if liver fibroblasts alter their antigen presentation to promote immune cell dysfunction over the
course of pre-metastatic niche education. This proposal will expand upon my knowledge of liver fibroblasts,
and allow me to strength my knowledge of other cancer fields, such as cancer immunology. The research
project and training plan proposed in this application will give me the skills and knowledge I need to pursue a
career as an independent investigator."

Radiation therapy (RT) is an important component of cancer treatments, yet its usage has been hampered due
to cardiovascular side effects. Although RT-induced heart disease (RIHD) disproportionally affects
cancer patients, the mechanisms underlying RIHD susceptibility remains elusive. In this multi-PI R01 grant, our
team will elucidate the mechanisms underlying RIHD susceptibility by utilizing human induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC) technology and comprehensive multi-omics profiling of heart tissues after irradiation. We
will identify genetic polymorphisms associated with RIHD by mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
in endothelial cells derived from 250 genetically diverse donors (200 cancer patients and 50 healthy control)
after irradiation using single cell RNA-sequencing (Aim 1). We will construct multi-cellular iPSC-derived
engineered heart tissues (EHTs) and use complementary genetic mouse model of RIHD for in-depth
functional and molecular profiling after irradiation. We will also use cutting-edge multi-omics techniques
(transcriptome-epigenome-proteome) to elucidate the molecular signatures underlying RIHD (Aim 2).
Finally, we will screen 5,000 FDA approved drugs for mitigating RIHD using novel iPSC reporter
constructs for high throughput analysis (Aim 3). In summary, understanding genetic risk factors of
adverse tissue response to irradiation and identifying potential radioprotective therapeutics will
improve the therapeutic index of RT and minimize RIHD."
10771520,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have a dramatic ability to alter their phenotype to adopt different roles in
diverse tissues and organs and contribute to vascular physiology, growth, remodeling, and repair. The inappropriate
SMC phenotypic modulation, however, results in a number of cardiovascular pathologies, including aortic aneurysm,
atherosclerosis, vascular malformation, systemic and pulmonary hypertension. To this date, there has been no cure
for these conditions, and surgical repair or transcatheter interventions are often associated with the recurrence of the
disease or major complications. PRDM6 is an SMC-specific epigenetic regulator that is most abundant in vascular
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and regulates its plasticity. Genetic variants in the PRDM6 gene have been associated
with a wide range of traits, including blood pressure regulation, reduced thoracic aortic distensibility and aortic dilation,
intracranial aneurysm, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes (T2D), BMI, and atrial flutter by genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). How PRDM6 is transcriptionally regulated and the epigenetic mechanisms by which it
regulates gene transcription are not known. Our goal is to outline the regulatory landscape of PRDM6 in the human
thoracic aorta, and identify PRDM6 enhancers that by regulating PRDM6 transcription determine the aortic diameter
by combining high throughput reporter assays with genome-wide association data. Further, we will delineate the
mechanisms of gene regulation by PRDM6 in mouse aortic SMCs (ASMCs) by genome-wide ChIPseq assays and
identify PRDM6-regulated genes in peak GWAS loci for cardiovascular diseases. Finally, we will examine the role of
Wnt signaling in aortic dilation and examine the effects of its inhibition in rescuing the trait. These findings are
expected to lead to target identification for the development of novel therapeutics for aortic aneurysms and other
diseases arising from dysregulated VSMCs, including aortic coarctations, and systemic hypertension."

10775748,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Clinical Core will be responsible for patient recruitment, sample acquisition, clinical data collection, and
regulatory compliance for both of the research projects in the HIPC Center entitled “Systems immunology
profiling of respiratory viral infections in vulnerable populations”. The Clinical Core has three Specific Aims. In
Specific Aim 1, the Clinical Core will identify, recruit, and follow a pediatric cohort with asthma and an adult
cohort with rheumatoid arthritis before and after acute respiratory viral infection. In Specific Aim 2, the Clinical
Core will manage the acquisition, processing, and distribution of biologic specimens with associated clinical
information. In Specific Aim 3, the Clinical Core will ensure regulatory compliance and the protection of human
subjects. To accomplish these aims, the Clinical Core will leverage the existing infrastructure of the Childhood
Asthma in Urban Settings (CAUSE) Network and the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason (BRI). For
Research Project 1, the Clinical Core will recruit children with asthma, children with allergic sensitization, and
healthy children with no personal history of asthma or allergic sensitizations. For Research Project 2, the
Clinical Core will recruit adults with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy adults with no personal or family history of
autoimmune disease. The Clinical Core will also be responsible for longitudinal sampling of peripheral blood,
nasal swabs, and sputum collected at four in-patient clinic visits: baseline, during acute respiratory viral
infection (ARVI; 4-6 days post start of ARVI), 4 weeks post ARVI, and 12 months post baseline. Nasal swabs
will also be collected at home at the start and end of ARVI. The Clinical Core will also collect demographic and
clinical data using the HIPC clinical characterization template. Samples and linked clinical data will be tracked
in the BRI Sample Repository database where datasets can easily be queried for sample selection and
provided to research scientists for samples upon unblinding, or to the Data Management & Analysis Core for
bioinformatics analysis. The Clinical Core will also be responsible for sample processing as well as sample
distribution to each of the Research Projects, the Genomics Core, and the Adaptive Phenotyping Core. The

The Genomics Core will provide sample processing and next-generation sequencing for the BRI HIPC Center
entitled “Systems immunology profiling of respiratory viral infections in vulnerable populations”. This core will
serve both Research Projects, receiving samples from the Clinical Core, and sharing high quality ‘omics

Aim 1, the Genomics Core will process nasal, blood and sputum samples and then perform genome scale bulk
RNA sequencing. In Specific Aim 2, the Genomics Core will perform single cell proteogenomic sequencing
(Total-seq) of both global and antigen-specific populations to elucidate single cell transcriptomes, single cell
immunophenotypes, and T cell receptor (TCR)/B cell receptor (BCR) clonotypes. For the global T cell analysis,
the Genomics Core will utilize the 10X Chromium platform with 10X Single Cell Immune Profiling and
BioLegend TotalSeq protocols for simultaneous single cell measurements of gene expression, cell surface
antibody staining and TCR/BCR reconstruction. For rare autoantigen-specific populations where too few cells
are available for use on the 10X system, the Genomics Core will utilize cell sorting on a flow cytometer into
multi-well plates. In both cases, the Genomics Core will integrate transcriptomic and TCR/BCR clonotype
measurements to link cells sharing ancestral relationships. The antigen-specific T cells to be examined is

The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research are development of a system for
direct, cell-free, validated fabrication of very large DNA assemblies, for applications in synthetic
applications and genome assembly. This system – “GenSyn” – will harness the advantages of
large DNAs for synthesis on supports in ways that will complement and synergize cell-based
techniques for the serial assembly of very large DNA molecules. The proposed research is
based on i) binding approaches supporting chemical and enzymatic processes; ii) shear-free
fluidic operations; iii) new methods for enhancing hybridization/ligation yields and iv) validations.
The devices are designed for gentle fluidic operations supporting assembly and image analysis
of large DNA constructs by epifluorescence microscopy. The first step in the GenSyn cycle will
be binding DNA molecules to a support by hybridization with oligonucleotides that are bound to
a derivatized glass surface. The hybridization and ligation steps will be optimized using physical
and chemical manipulations. Modified large DNAs will be used as coupler molecules, supporting
GenSyn cycles. Overall cycle performance metrics (coupling yields as a function of cycle
number, molecule breakage, reagent retention, timings and enzymatic activity) will be assessed
in ways that will inform and be guided by computer models. This research will help advance
fundamental studies on genomes and human health."
10920421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of early and late-stage drug attrition during pharmaceutical development. The
FDA now mandates that all new drugs be tested for cardiotoxicity before entering clinical trials. However, there
needs to be a safety screening platform that can swiftly detect cardiotoxicity cost-effectively, even before
investing too much time and resource in a drug development pipeline. This is further complicated by genomic
susceptibility in the population and how they respond to drugs. A tool that can incorporate the influences of sex,
ethnicity, and genetic background can provide accurate data on the safety and efficacy of drugs and stratify
patient populations to identify responders versus non-responders. In this SBIR grant, we propose to mitigate this
issue by providing pharmacogenomics and precision medicine platforms using human induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Our product is a kit comprising 100 unique and ethnically diverse iPSC
lines with equal sex representation. We aim to develop and validate this tool as a surrogate in vitro model for
predicting drug toxicity in patient groups at high risk for drug-induced arrhythmia. The study will use the “cell
village” platform to co-culture 10 different patient-specific iPSC lines simultaneously. We will scale this up by
multiplexing data from 100 different donors to identify cell-type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). As a proof-of-principle,
we will also assess inter-individual and intra-individual variability in responses to the chemotherapeutic agent
doxorubicin. Finally, Greenstone Biosciences, Inc is a biotechnology company located at the Stanford Research
Park. Greenstone uses latest advances in clinical genomics, computational biology, and patient-specific iPSCs

The Resource for AcademIc SuccEss (RAISE) Core is a Shared Resource, available to support all
Partnership participants. The RAISE Core will have two areas of emphasis: individualized career support for
Early Stage and New Investigators (ESIs/NIs) and serving as the Ombudsperson for all participants.
The Core will act as a foundation that supports the individuals that make up the Partnership. The RAISE Core
Leads have a extensive and complementary experience that allows them to act as coaches and advisors and
identify appropriate resources to support Partnership faculty and staff. By providing individualized support for
ESIs/NIs, the Core will directly address needs and knowledge gaps to enable faculty to increase their cancer
research capability, become more effective collaborators and enhance their research on cancer health
disparities. Regular individual meetings with ESIs/NIs will allow RAISE to provide advice, information, and
access to professional development activities in a safe setting and timely manner. At any time, ESIs/NIs may
request resources and/or activities for career growth. Such resources may include course release time for
manuscript or proposal preparation, registration and travel for a focused professional development workshop
and faculty coaching.
The heart of the Partnership is training and research collaborations between New Mexico State University and
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. The Ombuds can serve to strengthen and improve collaborations and
mentee-mentor relationships by facilitating communication to reveal differing expectations and work toward
agreement of shared expectations. This increases cancer research capability because time in conflict is
minimized and time and focus on research and education is maximized. This in conjunction with individualized
faculty mentoring creates an environment that encourages the professional development of faculty and
supports their engagement with the Partnership’s Guiding Principles (see Overall)."

Cancers are characterized by alterations to cellular metabolism that promote tumorigenesis, however our
understanding of how these metabolic changes are enacted and how they mechanistically support cancer cell
function remains lacking. While some metabolic changes reproducibly occur as a direct result of oncogenic
mutations, other metabolic alterations occur over time through adaptive metabolic protein expression changes
that allow cells to surmount metabolic deficiencies during cancer progression. Notably, this latter group is
predicted to be enriched for functionally important metabolic changes, suggesting that their identification would
have particularly relevance for cancer research. However, detailed understanding of which metabolic
alterations are the result of adaptations is hampered by the lack of models for directly studying reproducible
metabolic adaptations in cancer. Additionally, data on differences in cancer-related adaptations based on race
or ethnicity that contribute to health disparities are lacking. Here, we propose to address this knowledge gap
by investigating the mechanisms of metabolic adaptation system that we have recently established, where loss
of function mutations in the tumor suppressor succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) selects for cells with
concordant expression of components of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, which ultimately
supports cell metabolism and cell proliferation. Using this system, we will investigate the metabolic drivers of
complex I adaptations in SDH deficient cells (Aim 1) and use polyomics measurements of gene expression
processes, such a epigenetics, transcription, and proteostasis, to identify the cellular processes that enact
adaptive changes to complex I expression (Aim 2). We will also take a systematic approach using state-of-the-
art statistical methods to leverage publicly available patient tumor datasets containing polyomic measurements
and patient metadata in order to identify adaptive changes to metabolic protein expression during cancer
progression (Aim 3). This multidisciplinary Full Project also addresses the Partnership’s Guiding Principles
(see Overall section) for inclusive mentoring of diverse research teams and for research dissemination to
underserved communities, helping to educate and provide opportunities for next generation of researchers."
10783002,"Project Summary
 Radiotherapy (RT) is used in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas (STS), frequently in conjunction with
surgical removal of gross disease. For pre-op RT, 50 Gy equivalent in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) is commonly used,
while post-op RT requires 60–66 Gy (EQD2). For definitive (curative with RT alone) schedules, doses from 75–
100 Gy (EQD2) are needed. Paralleling changes in the RT field, STS are being treated with increasingly
hypofractionated schedules, but the combination of high dose and/or high dose per fraction RT to larger tumor
volumes can increase normal tissue toxicity. Indeed, patients with STS who receive RT risk major bone and soft
tissue problems including skin toxicity, non-healing ulcers, necrosis, lymphedema, bone fractures and second
malignant neoplasms (SMNs). This project will test the overall hypothesis that FLASH proton radiotherapy (F-
PRT) spares normal soft tissues and bone from early/late toxicities compared with standard PRT (S-PRT),
whereas the two modalities will be isoeffective in controlling sarcoma growth. Our preliminary data show reduced
skin damage, normal tissue inflammation, lymphedema, and vascular damage with F-PRT vs S-PRT. In addition
to modeling typical side effects of RT, as a malignancy that requires high dose RT to achieve local control,
sarcoma represents a good proving ground to evaluate whether F-PRT sufficiently modulates RT therapeutic
index to be clinically useful in other cancers. In Aim 1, the ability of F-PRT to abrogate tissue effects that pose
barriers to the treatment of sarcomas with RT will be tested using the following hypotheses in in vivo mouse
models: (i) the inflammatory component of normal tissue toxicity to F-PRT will be attenuated relative to S-PRT,
leading to less severe fibrosis and lymphedema after F-PRT compared to S-PRT by reducing the production of
pivotal drivers, such as TFG-b and VEGF-C (ii) F-PRT will produce less injury to tissue vasculature and preserve
its associated matrix, providing for faster and more complete recovery of skin and bone than is feasible with S-
PRT. In Aim 2, we will assess clinical outcome in murine sarcomas treated with F-PRT. Among the long-term
survivors of mice treated with whole body irradiation, we find fewer tumors in the F-PRT-treated group than in
the group treated with S-PRT. In Aim 2.1, we will employ a mouse model with transient p53 knockdown in
conjunction with wildtype controls, to test the ability of F-PRT to reduce the incidence of SMNs compared with
S-PRT. In Aim 2.2 we will perform dose escalation studies in mice bearing sarcomas to define the therapeutic
window of F-PRT when added in the pre-op setting as either one or three fractions. In Aim 3, we will conduct a
phase 1 dose escalation study using pre-op (amputation) doses from 21-30 Gy (4 dose levels) in one fraction to
determine safety and tolerability of F-PRT and provide pathologic evidence of efficacy. For a phase 2 definitive
trial, we will determine feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of hypofractionated (3 fraction) F-PRT at a BED-matched
maximum dose level informed by the Phase I study to provide parameters for the design of future F-PRT trials
in humans with STS and other malignancies."

Late toxicity of thoracic irradiation limits curative treatment of lung cancer and compromises long-term life quality.
Radiation induced lung fibrosis (RILF) is among the paradigm organs at risk (OAR) models for which evidence
for substantial reduction in late toxicity of electron FLASH irradiation was successfully demonstrated. Moreover,
the physiological oxygen condition has been postulated to govern the FLASH protective effect in normal tissues
while relatively hypoxic tumors demonstrate similar level of sensitivity. The only possibility to provide ultra-high
dose rate FLASH irradiation for deep-seated thoracic malignancies will be to utilize particles. Therefore, this
project aims to provide evidence if Carbon-, Proton- and Electron FLASH will spare OAR (lung, vascular, heart
and esophagus) following thoracic irradiation from early/late toxicities while demonstrating non-inferiority in terms
of local control of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. Whole thoracic irradiation (WTI)
and focal
irradiation are
performed with carbon ions, protons and electron (reference particle) FLASH vs. S-PRT. The
impact of FLASH on lung microvascular damage and M2 polarized inflammatory response in fibrotic lung tissue
as well as in-field heart- and GI-toxicity (esophagus) will be examined. Reduced oxygen dependence of high-
LET carbon ion FLASH could be further instrumental in exploration of the impact of transient hypoxia for the
emergence of FLASH effect. In addition to LET modulation with carbon ions, further development of an ultra-
rapid optical sensor for O2 is envisioned to online monitor, prove or disprove the postulated
oxygen dependence
of FLASH
effect in-vitro and in-vivo. Based on increasing application of salvage reirradiation of thoracic
malignancies, the impact of FLASH in sparing OAR toxicity post exposure to initial fractionated WTI will be
studied and surrogates of tissue radiation memory, i.e. molecular as well as senescent-cells like phenotypic
switches will be deconvoluted at single cell resolution. Considering potential differences in pathophysiology of
FLASH, the relevance of TGFbeta, CTGF and endostatin as key players of RILF in mitigating FLASH effects will
be evaluated. In context of tumor control, the consequence of intratumoral oxygenation heterogeneity on FLASH
effect will be studied. Assuming that in analogy to normal tissue, well perfused tumor regions may be spared by
FLASH, demonstration of non-inferiority of F- vs. S-PRT in tumor growth inhibition will be of utmost significance
for clinical translation of FLASH. In addition to OER effect, implication of intertumoral heterogeneity on F-PRT
efficacy will be elucidated by studying relevant pathways
involved in ROS homeostasis
rendering tumor resistant
to S-RT in NSCLC patients. The relevance of LET and partial oxygen pressure on FLASH effect will be further
systematically studied in 3D in-vitro tumor models and microvascular organoids. Based on preliminary data that
interferon signaling might be
differentially affected
by FLASH, the cascade of cytosolic cGas/STING/IFN
activation is examined and its potential consequence for inferior outcome in combination strategies with immune-
check-point blockade, as recently approved standard regimen for NSCLC, will be evaluated."
10783016,"Project Summary
The study of the preclinical animal models included in all four Projects plays a critical role to investigate the
overall hypothesis that Proton/Carbon Particle FLASH Radiotherapy is superior to Standard Particle
Radiotherapy in protecting normal tissues while maintaining equipotent malignant growth control. The
extrapolation of robust preclinical data in these experimental settings relies heavily on the unbiased
assessment of specific histopathological parameters to investigate the biological effects of FLASH particle
radiotherapy as compared to Standard particle radiotherapy on designated neoplastic lesions and adjacent
normal tissues. The Comparative Pathology Core (CPC; Core C) will provide its expertise contributing to the
planning, evaluation, and interpretation of the pathology endpoints of the animal experiments included in the
Projects. As a PennVet clinical laboratory, Core C importantly follows standardized working protocols with strict
QA/QC procedures. The histopathology service offered by Core C will ensure accurate collection, proper
preservation, timely processing, and staining of the animal specimens. Core C will provide the necessary
technical support and submissions of tissue samples will follow a prioritized route. In addition to standard
histopathology, Core C will also develop and validate tailored approaches to investigate and quantify tissue
changes specifically associated with RT such as fibrosis, intralesional distribution of inflammatory/immune cell
populations, expression of markers to evaluate epithelial barrier integrity, etc. The board-certified veterinary
pathologists of Core C will deliver expert evaluation and unbiased interpretation of the pathology endpoints.
Objective and reproducible quantification of tissue changes in response to the diverse RT modalities will be

10783091,"ABSTRACT – JHU TRAC ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC)
The overall goals of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) TRAC Administrative Core (AC) are to provide
overall management, coordination, and supervision of the JHU TRAC. To these ends, the AC will convene
biweekly meetings of the TRAC Steering Committee, led by the AC Co-Directors and TRAC Co-PD/PIs, Drs.
Petros Karakousis and Richard Chaisson, and comprising the Directors of each of the other five TRAC Cores.
The AC will be tasked with: 1) Providing scientific and administrative integration and coordination of the TRAC;
2) Providing a central oversight and communications platform for the TRAC; and 3) Managing administrative and
regulatory functions of the TRAC. The AC will promote scientific integration of the JHU TRAC by developing a
Strategic Plan for fulfilling the TRAC’s scientific mission, and, in coordination with the Developmental Core, by
sponsoring regularly scheduled scientific activities to stimulate innovative, cross-disciplinary collaborations and
provide mentoring and training opportunities for New Investigators (NI) and Early Stage Investigators (ESI),
including the weekly TRAC Seminar Series, which will highlight cutting-edge methodologies and TRAC-
sponsored research in each of the Cores, as well as the TRAC K-Club and K2R Club for reviewing NI/ESI grants,
and the annual TB Scientific Meeting and TRAC Data Fair. The TRAC Steering Committee will be responsible
for receiving and incorporating feedback on the functionality and utility of Core services, coordinating
communications within the TRAC, and assisting in resolving any conflicts between TRAC members. The AC will
provide fiscal and regulatory oversight of the TRAC and will serve as a liaison for communications between the
TRAC and the NIH. The AC will assist in convening an annual programmatic meeting with the NIH and the
External Advisory Committee (EAC) to assess the productivity and impact of the TRAC and to receive input on
future program directions. The TRAC AC will be housed within and leverage the existing scientific, administrative,
and material infrastructure of the JHU Center for Tuberculosis Research (CTR), which has considerable
experience in managing large collaborative research projects. The AC will provide added value to the JHU
TRAC by promoting synergy between the Cores; leveraging other resources across the university, including the
CFAR, Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, and NIH cores; enhancing communication between
investigators through listservs, newsletters, a website, and meetings; and ensuring that the total research output
and mentorship opportunities provided by the JHU TRAC are greater than the sum of its individual components,
with the ultimate goal of producing the next generation’s leaders in TB research."
10783094,"ABSTRACT – JHU TRAC DEVELOPMENTAL CORE (DC)
The mission of the Developmental Core (DC) is to support and mentor the next generation of TB researchers
and to recruit new TB investigators to increase the diversity and breadth of TB scientists at Johns Hopkins
University (JHU). Early Stage Investigators (ESI) need to integrate a variety of disciplines into their work, and
innovative leaders in other fields need to be brought into the TB research fold to generate transformational gains
in basic and clinical research, translation, and implementation. Despite the productivity and accomplishments of
the JHU faculty, nurturing and sustaining a pipeline of New Investigators (NI) who can provide leadership and
innovation in the future is extremely challenging. Without dedicated resources to support NI and ESI, many
trainees move onto other fields. There is a recognized need for seed funding, core resources, and intensive
mentoring for new researchers, who also would benefit from broadened skill sets beyond their primary training.
The DC will seek to draw from areas of underrepresented science and scientists, including opportunities for
future research/training. Fields such as systems biology in TB are lacking; thus, we will seek to bring in
computational modelers, bioinformaticians, and immunologists to fill this void. Novel approaches to
understanding TB pathogenesis are needed, with implications for molecular diagnostics, therapeutic vaccines,
and host-directed therapies. Nursing models to increase prevention, access to treatment, retention and human-
centered adherence models, as well as infection control and prevention science are recognized areas needing
TB outsiders. Finally, engagement of stakeholders in community-based participatory research methods is
increasingly needed in TB control globally.
The overall goals of the JHU TRAC DC are to support the highest priority innovative, cross-disciplinary TB
research, to support and mentor ESI in team science, and to recruit and support NI to TB. Developmental Awards
provided by the DC will provide both ESI and established investigators not currently involved in TB research with
the opportunity to stimulate innovative ideas and to receive support for fruitful new areas of interdisciplinary,
collaborative research. A special focus of the DC will be the recruitment and career development of Investigators
among groups nationally underrepresented in health-related research (UHRR). In addition to the Developmental
Awards, the Developmental Core will augment individual mentorship with Internal Scientific Reviews of grant
proposals, including specific aims reviews; TRAC-specific Writing Accountability Groups (WAGs), a TRAC K-
Club to support development of K01, K08, K23, or K99 applications, and a TRAC K2R Club for investigators
transitioning from K awards to R01 grants. The Developmental Core will work with the Administrative Core to
facilitate exchange of ideas and methodologies through a weekly TRAC Seminar Series, research-in-progress
meetings, workshops, and the annual JHU TB Scientific Meeting and TRAC Data Fair."

The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) TRAC Microbiology, Immunology, Animal Modeling and Imaging
(MIAMI) Core, comprising laboratories primarily within the Johns Hopkins Center for Tuberculosis
Research (CTR) and the Center for Infection and Inflammation Imaging Research (Ci3R), will offer a broad
panel of laboratory-based tools to support the mission of the JHU TRAC. Headed by Co-Directors Drs.
William Bishai and Sanjay Jain and assisted by a Core faculty of 10 additional highly accomplished
tuberculosis (TB) and non-TB investigators, the MIAMI Core will provide decades of combined research
and mentoring expertise, as well as access to cutting-edge laboratory technologies to enable training
opportunities in and support for TB research in: (a) Microbiology, molecular genetics and biosafety level-3
(BSL3) handling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; (b) Immunologic tools to assess host responses to TB
infection and diseases; and (c) Multiple clinically-relevant animal models of TB (mouse, guinea pig, and
rabbit), alongside the capacity to conduct in vivo imaging with CT, PET, and SPECT.
The MIAMI Core will assist New Investigators (NI) and Early Stage Investigators (ESI) in planning,
executing and interpreting the data from all preclinical studies, including small animal models of TB, mouse
breeding, advanced whole-body live in vivo imaging approaches, metabolomics, and single-cell RNA
(scRNA) sequencing. In addition to standard aspects of laboratory-based research on M. tuberculosis
microbiology, immunology and pathogenesis, the MIAMI core will provide added value by offering novel
topics (e.g., TB-HIV co-infection, environmental exposures and TB susceptibility, sex differences in TB
susceptibility, and advanced animal imaging), which are not currently available through the CTR and are
unique to the JHU TRAC. Furthermore, we will leverage numerous independent and institutional grants to
further strengthen basic science capabilities within the JHU TRAC.
The MIAMI Core staff will provide scientific and technical leadership and operational oversight to all animal-
related studies of the research program. MIAMI Core faculty will also participate in the weekly TRAC
Seminar Series, providing a scientific focus on novel research in TB pathogenesis and novel imaging tools,
as well as the TRAC-sponsored Writing Accountability Groups for NI/ESI, TRAC K-Club and K2R Club,
and annual TB Scientific Meeting and TRAC Data Fair. A centralized Core is essential to promote synergy
with the other JHU TRAC Cores and to provide integration, efficiency, and ease of use that will maximize
value and utility for all junior and established Investigators involved in the JHU TRAC. Overall, the MIAMI
Core will add significant value through integration of expertise, infrastructure, and capabilities to achieve
the goal of providing world-class microbiology, immunology, animal models, and imaging support to the
JHU TRAC, as well as research opportunities to trainees, junior faculty, and researchers new to TB."

Seminar Series, the TRAC-specific Writing Accountability Groups (WAGs) for NI/ESI, the TRAC K-Club and K2R
Club, the annual TB Scientific Meeting and TRAC Data Fair. The PPC investigators look forward to applying their
collective expertise to benefit TB clinical care by promoting innovative approaches to TB treatment and
accelerating experimental therapeutic agent development."
10783102,"ABSTRACT — JHU TRAC BIOINFORMATICS, MODELING AND BIOSTATISTICS CORE (BMBC)
Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved with humankind for centuries; as such, tuberculosis (TB) is arguably
one of the most complex infectious diseases to represent analytically. From within-host processes (e.g.,
macrophage heterogeneity and granuloma formation) to clinical presentation (e.g., latency and a prolonged
waxing-and-waning disease course) to population-level dynamics (e.g., slow epidemics driven by heterogeneous
transmission and susceptibility), TB presents distinctive challenges for modeling. By the same token, however,
advances in the development of computational models – including systems dynamics, statistical, and
epidemiological approaches – offer an unparalleled opportunity for developing new quantitative insights into the
dynamics of this uniquely human pathogen. The overall goal of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) TRAC
Bioinformatics, Modeling and Biostatistics Core (BMBC) is to ensure that innovative TB research is accelerated
by access to the most recent advances in computational methods for infectious disease research. These include
bioinformatics to make use of genomic, proteomic, and other high-throughput, genome-scale data; modeling, to
turn these data sets into mechanistic models; and biostatistics, for expertise in applying computational methods
to clinical and epidemiological research. To ensure the ability of the BMBC to achieve these goals, we have
recruited leaders whose expertise spans these areas. Dr. Joel Bader, Core Director, has extensive experience
in bioinformatics and modeling applied to infectious disease, as well as a long record of technology development.
Co-Director Dr. David Dowdy spans mathematical modeling and epidemiology; Co-Director Dr. Aletta Nonyane
has expertise in biostatistics and high-dimensional clinical data. Additional Core faculty provide deeper expertise
in key content areas, including genomics, biostatistics, mechanistic modeling (within-host and population-level),
systems dynamics, bioinformatics, and data science. The BMBC will achieve its overall goal and provide added
value to the JHU TRAC by enabling New Investigators (NI) and Early Stage Investigators (ESI) to achieve
independence in their research, whether by learning to perform computational research themselves or by
establishing productive partnerships with computational counterparts. The BMBC will assist NI/ESI, as well as
researchers new to the TB field, in gaining access to the high-performance computing facilities required for
modern studies. Additional examples of services the BMBC will provide include partnership with NI/ESI to
navigate computationally intensive components of their research, assistance with study design and/or analytical
approaches relevant to specific research questions, and linkage to formal training opportunities for interested
investigators. In addition, the BMBC faculty will provide synergy with the other JHU TRAC Cores and foster
multi-disciplinary collaborations by participating in the weekly TRAC Seminar Series, with a focus on
computational approaches to addressing critical TB knowledge gaps, as well as NI/ESI-focused Writing
Accountability Groups, TRAC K-Club and K2R Club, and the annual TB Scientific Meeting and TRAC Data Fair."
10781045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of alcohol related mortality. The specific
mechanisms responsible for ALD development and progression are not fully understood, and there is limited
therapy for any stage of ALD. Recent advances in single cell sequencing revealed the complex nature of the
disease, particularly the importance of cell-cell communication. Using single cell sequencing and co-culture
experiments we found that alcohol promotes pathological changes in cell-cell communication in the liver.
These changes are in turn mediated by alcohol-related epigenetic changes in hepatocytes, induced by histone
modification enzymes called KDM5B and KDM5C.
 Preliminary data suggest that KDM5 demethylases are involved in both ALD development and
resolution. During disease development KDM5 demethylases in hepatocytes promote pro-inflammatory
and pro-fibrotic signaling in non-parenchymal cells (NPC). During disease resolution KDM5 demethylases
control hepatocyte-NPC crosstalk that suppresses pro-resolving macrophages and contributes to poor
fibrosis resolution.
 Our data suggest that these diverse functions of KDM5 demethylases are mediated by set of
transcription factors that control KDM5 expression or/and activity (chromatin binding) in hepatocytes. Some of
these factors, such as C/EBPβ, STAT5B and Androgen receptor (AR) are sex-specific, and are involved in
sex-specific alcohol response, while others such as LXR are sex-independent.
 Taken together our data suggest that hepatocyte KDM5 demethylases alter cellular crosstalk that
promotes fibrosis development and contribute to poor fibrosis resolution after alcohol cessation. We
propose to investigate the sex-specific and sex-independent roles of KDM5B and KDM5C in cell-cell
communication in ALD with three specific aims:
Aim 1 To determine the role of KDM5B and KDM5C in cellular crosstalk in ALD
Aim 2 To define the mechanism of alcohol induced KDM5B and KDM5C activation in hepatocytes
Aim 3 To study the role of KDM5B and KDM5C-mediated regulation in fibrosis resolution
Results of the proposed project will provide novel insights into the nature of progression and resolution of
alcohol-associated liver disease. It should determine the role of KDM5 demethylases in the alcohol response
and identify the primary targets in males and females. The project will set the stage for further studies to
understand the role of cellular communication in liver disease progression and explore the potential targets for
therapy."
10781678,"Project Summary/Abstract
Losing weight can be life saving for people with obesity. However, among patients that do lose significant
weight, most have trouble keeping the weight off. People with obesity that lose weight experience
physiological, neural, and behavioral changes that drive weight regain. These changes resemble adaptive
mechanisms that defend body weight during periods of food scarcity, but for people trying to achieve a healthy
body weight and stay there, these mechanisms are decidedly maladaptive. Intervening to counteract them has
the potential to revolutionize the clinical approach to weight loss for people with obesity. The objective of this
proposal is to understand how the function of a brain area known as the nucleus accumbens is altered across
the weight “gain-loss-regain” cycle in mice. Our central hypothesis is that obesity is associated with
adaptations in the brain’s reward circuitry that enhance the pursuit of palatable foods, promoting weight regain
after obese animals lose weight, and thereby perpetuating this cycle. In Aim 1, we will use ex vivo
electrophysiological approaches to monitor changes in intrinsic and synaptic properties of accumbal neurons
as obese mice lose weight, critically determining adaptations that persist after weight loss. In Aim 2, we will
employ in vivo calcium imaging to measure the activity of specific populations of accumbal neurons as mice
gain, lose, and regain weight. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use viral genetic strategies to selectively silence specific
populations of accumbal neurons to determine whether this: 1) facilitates weight loss in obese mice that remain
on a high-fat diet; and/or 2) inhibits weight re-gain in formerly obese mice who have lost weight. Our long-term
goal is to understand how obesity alters reward circuitry and discover methods for reversing these changes.
This research will provide a critical foundation to advance efforts to improve weight loss outcomes in people
with obesity."
10779349,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Developmental disorders of the ocular motor system can lead to misalignment of the eyes called strabismus.
Mutations in genes responsible for extraocular motor neuron fate specification (e.g. PHOX2A and MAFB) and
axonal outgrowth (e.g. KIF21A and TUBB2B cause congenital incomitant (gaze angle dependent) strabis-
mus. However, although strabismus is heritable, only a few such genes have been identified. Consequentially,
causative genes for most forms of congenital incomitant strabismus are unknown. We propose to pair discov-
ery and hypothesis-driven approaches to (1) define genetic determinants of key aspects of extraocular motor
neuron development and (2) understand the behavioral and anatomical consequences of their disruption.
Extraocular motor neurons can be classified into subtypes along three lines: developmental time (early vs.
late); anatomy (muscle innervation), and function (fast/slow). Here we propose to use a small model verte-
brate, the larval zebrafish, to define the genes that determine subtype fate specification and control axon out-
growth/muscle innervation in developing extraocular motor neurons. Aim 1 will build on our existing pipelines
and preliminary data to establish an atlas of longitudinal transcriptional profiles from defined subtypes of ex-
traocular motor neurons. Next, Aim 2 will mine and validate transcriptional data to select candidate determi-
nants of extraocular motor neuron subtype fate and muscle innervation. Finally, Aim 3 will test hypotheses of
candidate gene function by measuring behavioral, functional, anatomical, and transcriptional phenotypes that
follow loss of function. By defining genetic determinants of extraocular motor neuron subtypes we take a signifi-
cant step towards understanding both normal and disordered ocular motor development."
10932224,"The Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) randomized trial recently led to new national
recommendations regarding antihypertensive treatment for chronic hypertension (CHTN) during pregnancy.
CHAP tested treatment (vs. none) initiated before 23 weeks for mild CHTN (BP <160/105 mmHg) at 61 US sites
(N=2408). Treatment improved maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, preterm birth and low
birth weight. CHAP is the largest CHTN treatment trial in pregnancy. However, critical knowledge gaps
remain concerning long-term effects of a) routine prenatal antihypertensive therapy and b)
superimposed preeclampsia in women with CHTN on exposed offspring. Preeclampsia complicates >30%
of patients with CHTN, is associated with impaired fetal growth, and emerging data suggest preeclampsia may
impair neurodevelopment (ND) and childhood growth/cardio-metabolic outcomes– including elevated BMI and
blood pressure (BP). Small for gestational age is an independent risk factor for impaired childhood ND and
altered growth. Therefore, it is crucial to define the long-term effects of prenatal antihypertensive therapy on
offspring (as well as mothers in our funded CHAP Maternal Follow-up study R01HL120338). CHAP has
randomized treatment and adjudicated preeclampsia data to enhance rigor to address:
Aim 1: Define the long-term safety of routine prenatal pharmacologic treatment of mild CHTN on childhood ND
and growth. Hypothesis 1a: Antihypertensive therapy for mild CHTN to a BP goal <140/90 mmHg compared
with no treatment is not associated with worse ND including cognitive functioning determined by General
Conceptual Ability (GCA, primary outcome). If we demonstrate non-inferiority, we will also test whether therapy
improves ND - given salutary neonatal results in CHAP. Hypothesis 1b: Antihypertensive therapy (goal <140/90
mmHg) vs. no treatment for mild CHTN is not associated with worse childhood growth and other cardio-metabolic
outcomes including BMI ≥85th percentile (primary outcome), obesity, underweight, and BP.
Aim 2: Determine whether preeclampsia superimposed on mild CHTN is associated with childhood outcomes
including ND, growth and other cardio-metabolic outcomes. Hypothesis 2a: Preeclampsia (vs. no preeclampsia)
is independently associated with adverse ND in children including impaired cognitive functioning by GCA
(primary outcome). Hypothesis 2b: Preeclampsia is independently associated with altered childhood growth
(including a primary outcome of BMI ≥85th percentile), obesity, underweight, serial growth and BP. We will also
explore mechanisms of childhood ND and abnormal growth by evaluating pre-specified perinatal and postnatal
characteristics as risk and predictive factors for abnormal ND and growth.
 The landmark CHAP findings and the NHLBI-funded CHAP maternal follow-up study offer a truly unique
opportunity and synergy for this proposed child follow-up study in order to glean the complete picture of long-
term effects of prenatal antihypertensive therapy and preeclampsia on offspring."

Leigh syndrome is the most common pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease and is characterized by
bilaterally symmetric, necrotic lesions in the deep gray matter of the brain. More than 80 different genes –
either in the nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA – can underlie Leigh syndrome, yet we do not have approved
medicines for this lethal disease. We recently discovered that low oxygen – hypoxia – can buffer diverse forms
of mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells, worm models, and mice. In fact, breathing hypoxia is able to fully
prevent brain disease in the Ndufs4 KO mouse model of Leigh syndrome, and when hypoxic breathing is
initiated in mice with advanced, end-stage disease, we are able to reverse neurodegeneration. We do not
know the full mechanism by which breathing hypoxia is able reverse disease, whether we can identify small
molecule drugs that can target these mechanisms to reverse disease, and whether hypoxia therapy this
generalize to other mouse models of mitochondrial brain disease. In this application, we will apply cutting edge
single cell genomics, proteomics, mtDNA editing, and mouse physiology studies to address these three
challenges. We anticipate that this project could have important implications for understanding the basic
biology of neurodegeneration and neuroregeneration, with important future implications for the treatment and
management of patients with mitochondrial disease."
10745971,"ABSTRACT
HIV-specific gene therapies are a powerful and promising means to achieve HIV cure/stable remission in the
absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and analogous molecules such
as eCD4-Ig offer one of the clearest paths to a cure, but are hindered by three key obstacles. First, passive
administration of bNAb/eCD4-Ig proteins is by definition a transient therapy; when circulating levels of these
potent anti-HIV factors decline, virus replication is able to resume. Second, gene therapy vector-based
approaches including adeno-associated virus (AAV) support prolonged expression of bNAbs and other antiviral
transgenes, but are frequently limited by host immune responses. Third, potent ART regimens suppress viral
replication to extremely low levels, rendering engineered HIV-specific lymphocytes unable to recognize and clear
persistently infected cells. We have generated an exciting set of tools and preliminary data that directly addresses
each of these barriers. To overcome the transient nature of bNAbs and associated immunogenicity of vectored
delivery approaches, we have performed an in vivo screen in nonhuman primates (NHP) and identified
engineered AAV variants that persist long term (consistent with a lack of recognition by the host immune system),
and specifically target B cells. B cell tropic vectors will be packaged with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery,
applying highly innovative covalent linkage methodology to double our vectors’ packaging capacity. We refer to
our novel in vivo delivery approach as Non-Immunogenic, Cargo-Enhanced (NICE) AAV: in a single dose, NICE-
AAV vectors will specifically reprogram B cells with bNAb or eCD4-Ig sequences targeted to the native IgG locus.
Finally, we will overcome the significant problem of insufficient viral antigen by supplying cell-associated HIV-1
Env in trans. Our recent publication in the NHP model demonstrates the immense success of this strategy to
stimulate HIV-1-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and should similarly boost and trigger expansion
of our gene-edited B cells. The central goals of our proposal are to validate the efficiency and specificity of B
cell-targeted NICE-AAV (AIM 1), to demonstrate that this in vivo delivery approach enables persistent
bNAb/eCD4-Ig expression in HIV anatomical compartments and reservoir sites (AIM 2), and most importantly,
to achieve a therapeutic impact in humanized mouse and NHP models of HIV persistence (AIM 3). We will merge
one of the most promising therapeutic modalities for HIV cure (bNAbs/eCD4-Ig) with our extremely unique in
vivo delivery platform (NICE-AAV). Importantly, this approach will be applicable not only for HIV-1, but for the
broad range of pathologies where monoclonal antibody therapies offer clinical benefit."
10830486,"The goal of this project is to provide the building blocks for an independent research program focused on
the mechanisms by which neural networks incorporate multisensory cues into episodic memories.
Discrimination of different contexts composed of distinct constellations of multisensory cues is a hallmark of
both episodic memory and spatial navigation, two functions ascribed to the mammalian hippocampus. The
Dentate Gyrus of the hippocampus is central to spatial and contextual discrimination; yet the neural
mechanisms by which contextual representations are encoded by principal granule cells has remained a
significant knowledge gap. Preliminary data based on in vivo two photon imaging indicates a novel elevation
of cue-associated activity in the granule cells that correlates with spatial discrimination, both of which
are reduced in mice without adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, this project proposes to test the
hypothesis that specialized cue cells in the dentate gyrus are critical for anchoring contextual
representations and are modulated both by adult neurogenesis and by entorhinal cortical inputs.
These studies represent a number of firsts in linking the physiology and behavioral function of the Dentate Gyrus
during learning of spatial discrimination by investigating 1) the evolution of spatial and cue-associated activity
of granule cells over time in order to support the encoding of contextual representations; 2) the activity of adult
born granule cells and their distinct contributions to cue representations; and 3) the activity of the entorhinal
cortex afferents to the Dentate Gyrus, and the mechanisms by which multisensory information arriving from the
external world generate internal hippocampal representations. To achieve this detailed circuit dissection, I will
use an integrative approach that merges in vivo imaging techniques, genetic-based circuit manipulation
strategies and computational analysis of multi-neuronal activity.
 The technical and scientific skills that I will develop during the training period of this project will become
the pillars of an independent research career investigating the function and development of the complex neural
dynamics which support cognitive functions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. This training will be
complemented by intense carrier developmental activities and mentorship that will prepare me for the practical
aspects of laboratory management, teaching and fund raising.
 Overall, these studies will provide novel insights into how the Dentate Gyrus local and long-range circuits
contribute to cue representations and facilitate contextual discrimination. Since hippocampal damage has been
implicated in the cognitive discrimination impairments associated with Alzheimer’s disease and PTSD,
constructing a dynamic picture of the Dentate Gyrus, an often overlooked hippocampal region, at cellular and
circuit resolutions during the formation of episodic memories may have an important clinical relevance."

10931525,"ABSTRACT – FULL PROJECT 3 ADM
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most devastating cancers with poor prognosis
and rising incidence. To combat this deadly disease, we should direct our efforts towards preventing PDAC or
halting the progression of precursor lesions to invasive disease parallel to developing novel treatments. One of
the earliest known initiating events for PDAC is the process of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Understanding
and reduction of ADM formation may reduce early PDAC development and progression. Blacks display a
significantly increased incidence and mortality from PDAC compared to other races for unknown reasons. The
role of race on pancreatic ADM and its contributions to the development and progression of PDAC need to be
addressed. In our previously funded CaRE2 Pilot Project, we used normal pancreatic acinar tissues from Black,
White and Hispanic donors to study the impact of race on acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and found that
Blacks undergo ADM to a greater extent than Whites or Hispanics. In this proposed Full Project as part of the
CaRE2 renewal, we will expand on and extend our previous pilot project by including diseased tissues from CP
and PDAC from White, Black, and Hispanic donors since accumulating evidence suggest that chronic
pancreatitis (CP) is a major precursor to the development of PDAC. We will investigate the impact of race on the
cellular and molecular events regulating the interplay between ADM and the microenvironment. Guided by our
published and unpublished results, we hypothesize that the racial disparities seen in PDAC are related to
differences in how the pancreas microenvironment develops during ADM, which means that ADM and its
surrounding microenvironment can be used as a target to treat PDAC. We propose the following specific aims
to address this hypothesis: Aim 1: The influence of race on ADM of healthy pancreas, CP, and PDAC-associated
acinar tissues. Aim 2: The roles of pancreatic stellate cells and macrophages in ADM and ADM reversal Aim 3:
Contributions of the race to ADM reversal and cell heterogeneity. The proposed studies will impact the field of
pancreatic cancer by providing a missing link between disparities, ADM, tumor microenvironment, and potential
treatments for CP and PDAC. The specific focus on the racial contributions of microenvironment remolding
during pancreatic metaplasia aligns with the Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement
(CaRE2) Health Equity Center’s overall goal to eliminate cancer health disparities among Black and Latino
individuals in California, Florida, and across the U.S."
10761711,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic
inflammatory condition affecting the human intestine associated with significant morbidity and limited
therapeutic options. Based on the current understanding of IBD pathogenesis, mucosal inflammation seems to
arise from a dysregulated crosstalk between intestinal microbes and poorly understood host immune, genetic,
and environmental factors. Current biologic therapies available for IBD target specific cytokines (e.g. TNF,
IL12/23) or trafficking receptors but a substantial proportion of patients either lose response to, or have disease
refractory to, these therapies. There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of IBD pathogenesis to
fuel the discovery of additional therapeutic targets.
Based on previous investigations, interleukin-1 (IL1) and its associated cytokine family may play a critical role
in IBD pathogenesis. IL10 receptor (IL10R)-deficiency, a monogenic form of CD-like IBD leading to colitis and
perianal disease within the first year of life, is characterized by enhanced IL1 production in macrophages in
both patients and mice. Blockade of IL1 signaling reduces the severity of colitis in IL10R-deficient mice, and
several IL10R-deficient patients have been successfully treated with anti-IL1 therapy as a bridge to curative
stem cell transplantation. Deep mucosal and peripheral immunophenotyping of a large cohort of IBD and non-
IBD subjects using mass cytometry (CyTOF) (Mitsialis et al, Gastroenterology, 2020) has demonstrated that
active IBD, especially CD, is characterized by enhanced IL1 expression in specific myeloid populations.
Although anti-IL1 therapy is not currently used in the treatment of IBD, this data has led to the hypothesis that
there may be subsets of IBD patients with IL1-mediated inflammation, similar to IL10R-deficient patients,
whose disease may be amenable to anti-IL1 therapy.
This project aims test this hypothesis by specifically interrogating IL1-related transcriptomic and proteomic
signatures in IBD. The aims of this project are to (1) define IL1-associated cellular populations in human
intestinal mucosa and blood using single cell analyses (CyTOF and scRNA-seq), and (2) determine how these
IL1-associated populations differ in IBD, non-IBD, and IL10R-deficient subjects, thereby enabling
characterization of IBD phenotypes associated with an enhanced IL1 signature. It is anticipated that IBD
patients with an enhanced IL1 signature may share transcriptomic/proteomic findings with IL10R-deficient
patients and be defined by a common clinical disease phenotype such as stricturing, fistulizing, or otherwise
severe disease. The hope is that the results of this work will guide and set the stage for anti-IL1 therapeutics in
IBD."

Preeclampsia occurs in 3% – 6% of women in the US and is a leading source of maternal and fetal morbidity during
pregnancy, immediately after pregnancy and has long term cardiovascular health implications for both mother and child.
Cost of healthcare management of preeclamptic mothers and infants within one year of delivery averages over $2.8 billion
dollars annually. Prevalence of preeclampsia is increasing overtime in the US. African American women have higher
prevalence of preeclampsia, are more likely to have severe preeclampsia and are three times as likely to die as white
Americans due to pregnancy related complications. No effective preventative strategy for preeclampsia exists to-date in part
due to a lack of understanding of causality – be it clinical risk factors, genetic predisposition or socially mediated factors.
Epidemiological studies identify multiple clinical risk factors anad predictors for preeclampsia such as obesity, diabetes,
preexisting hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and thrombophilia. Studies also show that in women without these
preexisting conditions, those with preeclampsia are at higher risk of developing hypertension, chronic kidney disease,
venous thromboembolism, stroke and diabetes 5 to 10 years later. Inferring causality for these associations is difficult with
epidemiologic data alone due to potential for confounding and reverse causation. Preeclampsia, many of its risk factors and
its consequences are heritable with hundreds of genetic variants identified for some traits like blood pressure, diabetes and
kidney function. Since genetic variants do not change during a lifetime and cannot be influenced by reverse causation, and
are less prone to confounding due to Mendel's laws of inheritance which dictate random assortment and segregation of
genes, we can design Mendelian randomization (MR) experiments to use genetic variants as instrumental variables for
exposures to robustly evaluate causality between exposure and outcome under certain assumptions. Coalescing genetic data
on preeclampsia from multiple sources and leveraging existing EHR-linked biobank (BioVU) at Vanderbilt, we form the
PreEclampsia Genetics Network (PEGNet) to study the genetic architecture of preeclampsia in over 28,000 preeclampsia
cases and over 290,000 controls. Using preeclampsia data from PEGNet and recent developments in MR methods, we
propose to evaluate causal relationships between clinical risk factors and predictors of preeclampsia including blood
pressure, kidney function, liver function, obesity and metabolic traits. We will evaluate whether preeclampsia is causally
associated with future cardiovascular complications or if this is due to reverse causality. With emerging MR methods such
as drug target MR, we propose to screen gene and protein targets associated with preeclampsia and also druggable. We
propose MR experiments to validate gene targets for existing drugs in the pipeline for preeclampsia prevention including
aspirin, metformin, statins, and PDE5 blockers. We propose a novel MR framework to elucidate the role colorism, a social
construct of discrimination based on skin color, on preeclampsia risk by using genetic variants of skin pigmentation as
instrumental variables for skin tone. We propose admixture mapping to understand how genetic ancestry influences
preeclampsia in women of African ancestry. Using MR methods in innovative ways, our research informs causal
mechanisms in preeclampsia, the first step necessary to design effective intervention strategies."

Melanoma (MEL) is a model malignancy for studying the mechanisms of cancer immunotherapy. Antibodies
that block negative regulators of T cell function, termed immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), have transformed
the treatment of MEL and other solid cancers. Although some patients have durable disease control, many fail
to respond or progress after initially experiencing tumor regression. Therapeutic resistance is enriched in two
molecularly defined MEL subtypes. Twenty eight percent of MELs possess activating mutations (Mut) in the
driver oncogene NRAS, the second most common Mut RAS isoform. Beyond MEL, Mut NRAS occurs in other
prevalent malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). We and others recently discovered that patients
with Mut NRAS MEL and CRC have a significantly shorter time to treatment failure. Separately, ~30% of MELs
acquire mutations in beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), an essential component of the human leukocyte antigen
class I (HLA-I) complex, following ICB progression. Cancers with Mut B2M are intrinsically resistant to CD8+ T
cell killing. Thus, two major gaps in knowledge that limit the potential of immunotherapy in MEL and other
common cancers include: (1) identification of immunogenic antigens expressed by Mut NRAS tumors, and (2)
therapeutic strategies to overcome genetic loss of HLA-I presentation. We hypothesize that cancers with Mut
NRAS or Mut B2M can be therapeutically targeted using T cell receptor (TCR)-based immunotherapies. In
support of our hypothesis, we discovered using a mass spectrometry (MS) screen that the three most common
NRAS hotspot substitutions generate shared (or “public”) neoantigens (NeoAgs) presented by a prevalent HLA
allele. Using a unique collection of biospecimens from patients who express an NRAS public NeoAg, we
generated T cells specific for these epitopes, retrieved their TCR gene sequences, and transferred public
NeoAg reactivity to polyclonal T cells. These results confirm the immunogenicity of screen-identified NRAS
public NeoAgs and enable the development of TCR-based therapies. We further discovered that a significant
proportion of MELs undergo direct killing by T cells that express an HLA class II (HLA-II) restricted TCR. Using
a genome-scale CRISPR screen, we found that cancer eradication is preserved when B2M and other HLA-I
genes are disrupted. Building on these preliminary data, we propose in Aim 1 to develop a novel therapeutic
approach for cancers expressing an NRAS public NeoAg using TCR genetic engineering and adoptive cell
transfer. In Aim 2, we will study the physical mechanisms underlying NRAS public NeoAg TCR specificity,
including the unique capacity of some TCRs to accommodate multiple hotspot substitutions. In Aim 3, we will
define the molecular basis for direct cancer cell killing by HLA class II-restricted TCRs and test combinations to
enhance the antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells. By completing these aims, we will
develop novel, mechanism-based cellular immunotherapies for Mut NRAS and HLA-I deficient cancers."
10764929,"Extensor tendon injuries of the hand are common and potentially debilitating. The long-term objective of
this research is to improve patient outcomes following extensor tendon injury. The first step towards this
objective is to determine the effect of extensor tendon injury on patient function. Additional steps can then be
taken to improve treatment and outcomes once the underlying causes of poor patient outcomes are known. The
first step is the focus of this proposed work.
 Cadaveric experiments and mathematical modeling will be used to increase our understanding of the effect
of extensor tendon injuries on hand function, and to improve treatments for extensor tendon injuries.
 In the cadaveric experiments the extensor tendons will be loaded to generate finger motion. Tendon
excursion, tendon load, grip and finger rotation will be measured during these experiments. There will be two
experimental groups with different patterns of extensor injury. Data collected from the first experimental
group will be used to create mathematical models relating extensor tendon injury to finger function. The
mathematical models will take simulated injury as an input and output finger motion and grip strength. An
optimization procedure will be used to generate the models. Given the extensor tendon injury configuration in
group one, the optimization will adjust the mathematical model parameters to minimize the difference between
model output and group one data.
 These optimized mathematical models will then be given group two injury configurations as a system input.
The accuracy of the mathematical models will be determined by comparing the model’s outputs to data
collected from the second experimental group.
 The effect of extensor tendon injury on finger function will be determined using repeated measures analysis
of variance. Accuracy of the mathematical models will be quantified using a similarity metric comparing the
second group’s experimental data to the output of the mathematical models using group two’s set of simulated
extensor injury."
10765719,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is usually accompanied of intellectual disability (ID), is part of a group of
neurodevelopmental disorders that are usually diagnosed during the first two years of age. The social, emotional
and communication skills of affected individuals are severely impaired throughout life and are often accompanied
by a spectrum of debilitating symptoms with different degrees of severity including, stereotypic behavioral traits,
epileptic episodes, sensory oversensitivity, and impaired motor functions that seriously interfere with their daily
life activities. ASD is an important public health concern as it affects 1 in 54 individuals. It occurs in all racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and in the United States alone, the estimated total cost per year per children
is between $11.5 and $60.9 billion. Thus, families with ID/ASD-diagnosed children experience heavy
psychological and financial burdens. While early intervention services can significantly improve certain aspects
of child's development, no disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Despite enormous efforts, lack
of effective therapies is likely due to our poor understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
these conditions with exceedingly complex etiology. The number of different types of genetic variations
associated with ASD keeps increasing thanks to the improvement in genomic sequencing technology. However,
there is still little understanding of how these genetic changes impact cellular and molecular pathways or which
brain cell are more affected by these mutations that ultimately result in brain dysfunction associated with ASD.
Among them, loss-of-function genetic variations in the SETD5 gene, which is believe to play an important role in
the structure of the genome and in regulating expression of neuronal genes. However, there are important
knowledge gaps on the molecular and cellular pathways controlled by SETD5 and how ASD-related mutations
in this gene could contribute to neuronal dysfunction. We and others started to address these questions by
generating Setd5 deficient mice and showed impaired neuronal function and appearance of ASD-like behaviors.
However, mouse models are limited to accurately recapitulate not only disease pathologies but also the
protracted process of human brain development. Thus, they can lead to misleading hypothesis. To compensate
for these limitations, we have modeled for the first time SETD5-related ASD using human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSC). Generating neurons from these cells we recapitulated neuronal dysfunction as previously
observed in mice models. More importantly, we uncovered new mechanisms inducing this neuronal dysfunction.
In particular, we found that astrocytes, which are more abundant and necessary for keeping neurons healthy
and connected in the brain, might produce neurotoxic activity. In this proposal, we extensively characterize the
molecular and cellular pathways involved in this process and explore novel therapeutic targets to revert or
prevent neuronal dysfunction induced by SETD5 mutations. The successful completion of this research will
provide an unprecedented view of astrocyte involvement in ASD and potentially revolutionize its treatment."
10777951,"Project Abstract
Stroke survivors experience profound mobility challenges limiting community ambulation which impacts overall quality
of life. Studies show mobility is strongly linked to quality of life, participation, and well-being, and robotic exoskeleton
assistive devices have significant potential to improve mobility by providing assistance at lower limb joints. However, no
technology enabling personalization to individuals with varying mobility needs exists. This proposal aims to understand
how optimized ankle and hip exoskeletons in combination with biofeedback can impact mobility post-stroke.
The overarching hypothesis is that targeted biofeedback combined with optimized exoskeleton assistance can
improve community ambulation capability across a cohort of stroke survivors with variable baseline gait function.
In order to optimize exoskeleton assistance for individuals post-stroke, the team will address 3 aims. Aim 1 will
determine and compare the benefit of personalized hip and ankle exoskeleton assistance for bilateral improvement
of post-stroke gait. To compensate for distal ankle weakness, stroke survivors often compensate with the hip joint.
Therefore, the hypothesis is that assistance targeted at the hip may provide a larger improvement in walking speed. Aim 2
will combine exoskeleton technology with biofeedback to enhance and synchronize wearable robotic assistance to
an individual stroke survivor’s gait pattern. The hypothesis is that biofeedback to improve paretic leg positioning will
work synergistically with both hip and ankle exoskeletons to improve stroke gait mechanics and walking speed. Further, it
is expected that larger improvements will be observed with the ankle exoskeleton assistance combined with biofeedback
because improved paretic leg positioning will enable greater forward propulsion of the CoM during ankle exoskeleton use.
Aim 3 will evaluate and compare clinically relevant outcomes with and without the optimized technologies in real-
world environments in an effort toward clinical translation.
This work leverages a novel self-adaptive AI system to optimize performance of post-stroke gait coupled with
biofeedback in clinically-applicable exoskeletons. This work will fundamentally innovate new technology in 3 key areas:
1) New AI and optimization systems to personalize exoskeleton control to post-stroke gait, 2) A new wearable overground
biofeedback system to cue exoskeleton users to improve gait mechanics, and 3) Implementation of these systems on state-
of-the-art exoskeletons with clinical testing in stroke survivors and applications to community ambulation. Concurrently,
the work has scientific impact through the analysis of the biomechanics of hip compensation for ankle weakness and the
associated hip-ankle trade-off changes that occur with ankle and hip exoskeletons and targeted biofeedback. Lastly, this
work aims to push for clinical translation through targeted comparisons of clinical outcomes in stroke survivors
ambulating in real world settings with and without the new technologies.
Ultimately, the project outcomes will enable personalized assistive devices to improve post-stroke community mobility
and overall quality of life."
10777959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 When patients present with urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia, with or without
urgency incontinence, we consider this the clinical phenotype of overactive bladder (OAB).
Clinical observations and data suggest that clinical OAB may be comprised of several underlying
subtypes. Discerning between subtypes has been challenging but is imperative to precisely
guide targeted treatments.
 Within the last decade, several large observational cohort studies have been developed
with the goal of improving our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying benign
urologic symptom disorders. The NIDDK-sponsored Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of
Pelvic Pain (MAPP) network and Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN)
have collected data on urologic pain syndromes and non-painful lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS), respectively. Both cohorts included patients with OAB. To identify clinically meaningful
subtypes, MAPP and LURN used clustering methods to mathematically classify patients into
probable subtypes using clinical characteristics. Though biospecimens were collected in both
cohorts, biologic data from these specimens were not included in clustering. If OAB subtypes
have different pathophysiology, biologic data are likely to add important distinguishing
information, and possibly be predictive of differential treatment responses.
 Based on clinical observations and prior clustering work, we hypothesize that the syndrome
of idiopathic OAB is comprised of 5 phenotypic subtypes, including dysbiotic and metabolic
subtypes that will have distinct microbiome profiles from the others. To test our hypotheses,
we propose an innovative approach combining MAPP and LURN clinical datasets and already
collected biospecimens. Since sex-specific factors may affect subtypes, analyses will be
performed on females and males separately.
 Our current “one-size fits all” algorithm of OAB treatments results in repeated medical
visits, high health-care costs, and marginal long-term effectiveness. There is a major gap in
knowledge of OAB subtypes, which in turn hampers our ability to target treatments to
subgroups where they would be most effective. The proposed analyses by experienced data
scientists present a unique opportunity to leverage existing resources from well-defined
prospective clinical cohorts to substantially enhance our understanding of OAB."

The Penn-CHOP proposal builds on collaborations and complementary expertise in phenomics and genomics.
The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) is associated with high risk for neuropsychiatric disorders across the
lifespan. The clinical presentation and course are markedly heterogeneous, with a range of developmental
neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD, Anxiety, ASD, and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders. Notably,
presentation and course resemble idiopathic disorders. Therefore, beyond the specific genetic syndrome
investigated, the proposed accelerated longitudinal design will identify convergent risk mechanisms for
developmental trajectories of neuropsychiatric disorders in the broader population.
 We are uniquely positioned to establish developmental trajectories during a critical period, adolescence and
emerging adulthood. Lacking in the literature of 22qDS is a systematic examination of environmental
exposures, which play an important role in psychopathology and neurocognition in the general population. The
nature and degree of medical burden have likewise not been examined in 22qDS. Taking a `genetics first'
approach of ascertainment based on a known deletion will allow us to overcome barriers posed by the genetic
and phenotypic complexity of idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. We postulate that 22q11.2
deletion exerts a large main and multifactorial effects on psychopathology, with contributions from multifaceted
environmental exposures and common and rare genetic variants. Dissecting these effects with dimensional
measures of psychopathology and neurocognition can elucidate the combined contribution of genetic and
environmental mechanisms to psychiatric conditions and build models of risk prediction. Our ability to pursue
such a large-scale study capitalizes on our existing successful collaborations, complementary expertise, and
institutional commitments to achieve these goals.
 We propose to parse dimensional measures of psychopathology, neurocognition, and environmental
exposures, to elucidate the architecture of risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in 22qDS focusing on the
emergence of psychosis. Prospective evaluation with dimensional measures relevant to neuropsychiatric
disorders will be applied to a cohort of 300 individuals with 22qDS and their parents, establishing trios. Thus,
we will examine family and environmental factors that can contribute to the heterogeneity of presentation and
developmental course in 22qDS. Recruitment for longitudinal prospective phenotyping will leverage an existing
large cohort with a wealth of clinical data, many of whom have already been ascertained and comprehensively
characterized with a range of phenotypic measures. We will also utilize existing genetic data from the largest
available case-control samples in the PGC to generate polygenic risk scores for the most common
neuropsychiatric disorders evident in 22qDS and examine their relation to outcome. This project will contribute
to common phenomic and genomic resources established for data sharing."

 Urinary tract infection (UTI) and recurrent UTI (rUTI) significantly reduces the quality of life of millions of
women annually and poses a growing health threat due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant
uropathogenic bacteria. Klebsiella spp. represent the second most common bacterial species isolated from the
urine of women experiencing rUTI but have been largely understudied in the context of rUTI. Within the Klebsiella
genus, Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most common human pathogens; however, genome sequence
analysis has revealed that that K. pneumoniae isolates encompass at least three distinct species: K.
pneumoniae, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae. Although K. quasipneumoniae strains are commonly isolated
from patients with UTI and encode known virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes, no study has
evaluated urovirulence phenotypes of K. quasipneumoniae in an animal model. Indeed, the clinical prevalence
of K. quasipneumoniae in UTI remains unknown.
 Among the virulence factors that Klebsiella spp. possess, type 1 (fim operon) and type 3 (mrk operon)
fimbriae play a crucial role in mediating bacterial adhesion and invasion of host epithelial surfaces. Type 1
fimbriae are widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae, but the presence of the gene fimK differentiates the
fim operons of Klebsiella spp. from Escherichia coli. In K. pneumoniae, FimK is a regulator of fim operon
expression and is comprised of an N-terminal DNA binding domain that binds the fimS regulatory region and a
conserved C-terminal EAL domain with phosphodiesterase activity. Through sequence alignment of the fim
operons of sequenced K. quasipneumoniae and K. pneumoniae isolates, we have discovered that the fimK gene
of K. quasipneumoniae is truncated and lacks the C-terminal EAL domain. This is important because not only is
fimK a key regulator of fim operon expression, but it is also proposed to co-regulate mrk operon expression by
modulation of cyclic di-GMP levels through its phosphodiesterase activity. We have found that FimK-mediated
regulation of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae is distinct in K. quasipneumoniae due to the absence of the FimK EAL
domain. We hypothesize that because of this regulatory difference, bladder infection dynamics and the
requirement for type 1 versus type 3 fimbriae for bladder colonization may be distinct in K. quasipneumoniae.
 This proposal will address these hypotheses and produce foundational knowledge of K.
quasipneumoniae bladder infection dynamics by i) defining the clinical prevalence of K. quasipneumoniae in UTI
in women, ii) evaluating K. quasipneumoniae rUTI isolates in a mouse model of acute UTI, and iii) evaluating
the role of K. quasipneumoniae type 1 versus type 3 fimbriae and FimK during acute UTI. Taken together, this
work will produce the first foundational knowledge of clinical prevalence and bladder infection dynamics
of the understudied human uropathogen K. quasipneumoniae and define the impact of the conserved truncation
of the fimbrial regulator FimK on the regulation of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae and bladder colonization."

Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAV) cause hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, despite widespread pre-
exposure and vaccination. IAV persists in the human population by continually evolving resistance to herd
immunity through a process known as antigenic drift. The evolutionary potential of RNA viruses like IAV is often
considered enormous due to their rapid replication and high mutation rates. In reality, the evolutionary potential
of IAV is highly constrained by the need to maintain a wide array of molecular functionality in a tiny genome. The
specific constraints limiting IAV evolution are very poorly characterized and defining them is critical for
understanding and potentially predicting the specific evolutionary pathways most likely to be taken by these
viruses. We discovered that phenotypic variation in the viral neuraminidase (NA) gene results in the viral
hemagglutinin (HA) gene taking divergent mutational pathways to escape neutralizing antibody pressure. These
data suggest that the need to maintain a functional balance between the opposing activities of the viral
glycoprotein genes (HA and NA) significantly constrains how the virus evolves to escape from host immune
pressure. We hypothesize that these viral constraints, along with additional constraints imposed by the host
environment, play significant roles in shaping the specific pathways of IAV antigenic evolution that occur in
humans. We will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo experimental evolution and mechanistic approaches to
define the specific host and viral factors that constrain the antigenic evolution of the HA gene. In Aim 1, we will
quantify phenotypic variation amongst recently circulating NA genes and quantify how this phenotypic variation
alters the evolutionary landscape of the HA gene. In Aim 2, we will explore how natural phenotypic variation in
NA influences antigenic escape in vitro and in vivo. Finally, in Aim 3, we will define how changes in the host
environment and sialic acid profile influence the potential for recent human seasonal H1N1 viruses to escape
from humoral immune pressure. Collectively, these studies will deepen our mechanistic understanding of the
antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses in humans."

Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of
$31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular
(RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains
poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function.
Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular
imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic
imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in
image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can
offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes
according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular
risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function,
evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in
the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based
deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of
unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we
will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes
including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital-
based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and
standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human
assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development
program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist
in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established
scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will
guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period."
10756453,"The long-term goal of this R01 is to understand how epigenetic mechanisms control Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latency and carcinogenesis. EBV latent infection is associated with a diverse spectrum of epithelial and lymphoid malignancies. The highly adaptive nature of EBV infection to various host cells and environments suggests that it exploits fundamental cellular processes of dynamic gene regulation. EBV is known to adapt various gene expression programs, termed latency types, in different host cell and tumor environments. These latency types and viral gene expression patterns are determined by epigenetic factors ranging from nucleosome positioning, histone modifications, CpG DNA methylation, transcription factor occupancy, and chromosome conformation. The mechanisms regulating viral and host DNA epigenetic controls are not fully understood but are critical for understanding viral latency and oncogenesis in diverse cell types. We have been investigating the process through which EBV establishes and regulates the epigenetic program of both viral and host genomes. In the previous funding cycles, we identified the viral tegument protein BNRF1 as a binding partner of DAXX-histone H3.3 complex and showed that this interaction is required for viral chromatin assembly and gene expression during the early, pre-latent phase of infection. We have identified viral and cellular transcription factor binding sites for EBNA1, EBNA2, CTCF, cohesin (RAD21), EBF1, RBP JK and chromosome conformations that change during the establishment of latency and correlate with different latency types. We have assayed chromatin accessibility and RNA expression changes during the multiple stages of EBV-induced B-cell immortalization to correlate gene expression with chromatin architecture. We have also found that viral and host DNA methylation programming depends on viral EBNA2 and vmiRNAs that coordinately regulate TET2 expression and cytosine hydroxymethylation and demethylation. We now propose to further advance these studies to better understand the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the control of EBV latency and oncogenicity. We will test the overarching hypothesis that EBV reprograms host epigenetic mechanisms to enable viral genome persistence and transcriptional plasticity that drives EBV-associated oncogenesis."
10756454,"Aging-associated common human diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus are influenced by
small changes in multiple genetic factors, but the precise nature of each factor is still unclear. Our long-term
goal is to gain deeper understanding of genetic risk factors for the common diseases by developing mouse
models that closely mimic human genetic variations. ELMO1 locus, encoding engulfment and cell motility
protein 1, is associated with diabetic nephropathy in humans. With a novel mouse model system, we
established that the graded increase in the levels of ELMO1 determines the severity of nephropathy and
cardiomyopathy in diabetic mice through increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We further
found that a high-dose vitamin B12, a natural superoxide scavenger, prevents and even restores the cardiac
dysfunction in diabetic mice. ELMO-DOCK (dedicator of cytokinesis) complex is a guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) that activates RAC (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate). Activated RAC not only
triggers actin remodeling, cell growth and motility, but also is essential for the activation of NADPH oxidases, a
major producer of ROS. However, why ELMO1 is so critical in diabetic complications of parenchymal cells
remains unknown. Excess ROS is a common factor in aging-associated diseases, and acute tissue injuries
that follow ischemia reperfusion (IR) and infection. IR induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is also preventable
with B12, and our preliminary data suggest that ELMO1 is involved in determining the severity of AKI. ELMO-
DOCK-RAC is evolutionally conserved as an initiator of clearing process of apoptotic cell corpse and organelle,
which is in part an attempt to salvage basic elements such as nucleotides and amino acids during cell damage
and apoptosis/death. Salvaging is good when these elements are scarce, but in abundance, excess ROS
production only does harm. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that ELMO1 activates RAC in parenchymal
cells responding to cellular stress and damage, and inadvertently influences the severities of
disease/conditions. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims; (1) to examine the effects
hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and other factors altered by diabetes have on neonatal cardiomyocytes in
culture, and the roles of ELMO1-dependent RAC1 activation in angiotensin II induced cardiac hypertrophy and
failure in vivo; (2) to investigate ELMO1-dependent RAC1 activation in ischemic AKI, and its related cardiac
complications, and explore the possible involvement of ELMO1 in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
the severity which is greatly enhanced by age and comorbidities in the current COVID pandemic; and (3) to
determine the beneficial effects beyond superoxide scavenging which vitamin B12 execute on diabetic
cardiomyopathy. Ultimately, increased understanding of factors influencing the severity of aging-associated
common diseases should help lead us to a deeper knowledge of pathogenesis of these diseases and to new
therapeutic strategies for patients."

It is well established that phytonutrient-rich foods are cancer preventive and that diets high in phytochemicals
such as carotenoids, tocopherols, and chlorophylls are associated with decreased cancer risk and recurrence.
Historically, traditional dietary patterns across multiple cultures have been plant-based and phytonutrient-rich.
As dietary patterns have westernized, they have become less plant-based and thus less phytonutrient-rich. In
parallel, communities that previously consumed plant-based diets have experienced increased risks of cancer
and cardiometabolic disorders. The Hispanic/Latinx community in southern New Mexico has been particularly
impacted by cancer health disparities making it imperative to develop effective and sustainable strategies to

optimize carotenoid, tocopherol and chlorophyll content and bioavailability by changing cooking methods and
ingredients in 15 culturally congruent southern New Mexican recipes. Aim 2: To develop and test the effects of
a culturally adapted 6-session curricula delivered through the NMSU Cooperative Extension Service in two

research will build upon our “kitchen-to-lab-to-table” research model of working with communities with low
incomes and limited resources with high cancer health disparities to identify culturally appropriate methods to
improve diet intake and quality. Study results will be used to continue to develop evidence-based methods to
inform culinary practices to disseminate to communities, and to design community-based dietary interventions
to improve the health of vulnerable communities. The research will establish a new “kitchen-to-lab-to-table”

Smoking prevalence among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults in New Mexico is more than twice as
high as non-SGM adults, suggesting that existing SGM-related disparities in tobacco use will persist well into
the foreseeable future unless sustained efforts are undertaken to address them. Helping young adult tobacco
users to quit is a critical piece of SGM-directed tobacco control interventions, yet there have been few efforts to
develop tailored treatments specifically for this population. This is a critical gap given that this is a population
whose access to and use of traditional cessation treatments involving counseling and pharmacotherapy is
poor. SGM young adults in New Mexico (NM) are likely to experience unique influences on tobacco use and
cessation tied to both their ethnic and SGM identities, in addition to other aspects of their identity. An
intersectional focus is critical for developing interventions to address high rates of tobacco use among SGM
young adults in New Mexico that are acceptable, accessible, and effective. To address these needs, we have
adapted an avatar-led, digital Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program for SGM young adult
smokers at all stages of readiness to quit. This program (called Empowered, Queer, Quitting, and Living, or
EQQUAL) showed great promise in a single-arm pilot trial: 93% satisfaction and a 23% biochemically-
confirmed quit rate. In this study, we propose to develop a version of the program that is culturally tailored to
SGM young adults in New Mexico (EQQUAL-NM) and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=120) to
preliminarily evaluate acceptability and efficacy of EQQUAL-NM relative to the National Cancer Institute’s
QuitGuide program. We hypothesize that, compared with QuitGuide, EQQUAL-NM will show a trend toward
greater satisfaction, number of logins, biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence nicotine and tobacco
abstinence, and psychological flexibility (i.e., ACT’s theory-based change mechanism). We will also explore
readiness to quit, sexual orientation, gender identity, and Latinx ethnicity as moderators of treatment effects.
This project is significant: (1) it focuses on an NIH-defined disparities group with a high prevalence of tobacco
use that has been underserved in treatment research; (2) it addresses SGM individuals’ desire for a program
tailored to their unique needs and challenges in a readily scalable and accessible format; (3) if proven
effective, EQQUAL-NM would be highly disseminable online and via SGM community-serving organizations in
NM. It is also innovative: (1) it is the first self-guided digital cessation treatment culturally tailored for SGM
young adults in New Mexico, (2) there are currently no other SGM-tailored treatments available in Spanish, (3)
its novel treatment approach advances the science of ACT for tobacco cessation by testing effectiveness for
users at all stages of readiness to quit; and, (4) use of avatars and interactive games as engagement
strategies is substantially different than existing treatments. This project will generate all the pilot data needed
to support an R01-level project testing the effectiveness of EQQUAL-NM in a fully-powered trial."

In New Mexico, 15.2% of children between the ages of 6-15 are obese, ranking New Mexico 23rd among all
U.S. states. Obesity prevalence also increases with age. In 2018, only 13% of New Mexico children ages 2-4
years were obese compared with 32% of adults 18 years of age and older. Likewise for Washington in 2016,
12% of children ages 2-4 years were obese compared to 29% of adults. To address the prevalence of obesity
and related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and several types of cancer, programs focusing
on increasing opportunities for active living and healthy eating are necessary. Multi-component school-based
obesity prevention programs have demonstrated increases in PA and improvement in dietary habits; however,
most afterschool programs are short term; evidence is needed to confirm long-term effects. Moreover,
programs that involve parents have shown to be more successful in helping children choose healthier
behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to pilot test the Healthy Parents and Children
Enhancement (H-PACE) program -- a community-engaged research project – through an existing after-school
program in Las Cruces, NM and a new partnership in Sunnyside, WA among children 8-11 years of age (3rd-
5th grade). It is expected that implementing the H-PACE program will be feasible and demonstrate clinically
important changes in improving children’s lifestyle behaviors. In addition to participating in after-school
activities, which will include structural, active play as well as educational lessons and activities, children will
take home family-based engaging activities such as fruits and veggies for fun preparation at home with
parents. Parents will also be connected to each other and program staff via a private, invitation-only Facebook
group, which will provide regular updates on after-school activities and particular family-based weekly
assignments. The life skill portion of this program is designed to have lasting impact on children from
households of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and their family members. The current pilot project will also
enhance the community-academic partnerships between the local school district, New Mexico State University,
and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center to deliver an after-school program that is low cost, mutually beneficial,
and sustainable. Proper nutrition and physical activity (PA) are essential parts of overall health. Together, they
can decrease the risk of developing obesity as well as related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease,
stroke, and several types of cancer. Health disparities associated with active living have led the CDC to call for
greater active living programing for children. The current project will address this need in southern NM and the
Lower Yakima Valley of Washington by implementing an active living after-school program at four school sites."

This project will investigate spatio-temporal delivery of FLASH radiation using pencil beam scanning technology.
Modern Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) technology can deliver spatially non-uniform (Gaussian-like) pencil beam
in very high instantaneous dose rate to both shallow and deep-seated tumors; however, the low dose tail of a
pencil beam and the relatively slow volume scanning speed for large targets generate a variable dose rate at
selected target or normal tissue locations. The impact of this spatial-temporal variation is still unknown for
FLASH. Even at the same (averaged) dose rate, degeneracy exists that the FLASH treatment can be delivered
by different time-dose sequences. There is a need to study the timing structure of dose delivery in the context of
FLASH treatment, as well as measuring and documenting each FLASH treatment so that the outcome can be
better understood. Our central hypothesis is that proton PBS can be optimized to deliver FLASH enhanced
radiotherapy with existing accelerator technology. The aims of the proposal are:
Aim 1 - Investigation of spatio-temporal variations and SOBP versus shoot through PBS beams.
Aim 2 - Development of a spatial-temporal biological effective dose model for PBS-based FLASH
proton therapy.
Aim 3 - Development of fast dose recording instrumentation, image guided positional systems, quality
assurance procedures, and end-to-end validation.
Success of this project will demonstrate the ability to deliver FLASH to large treatment volumes using proton
PBS for the first time. Combined with the ability of proton therapy to accurately deliver dose to deep targets,
this will allow translation of PBS FLASH proton therapy to early stage clinical trial studies."

Rare and unnatural carbohydrates play an essential role in the potency and selectivity of hundreds of bioactive
natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. These scaffolds often feature unusual relative/absolute
stereochemistry, pyranose/furanose ring branching, heteroatom substitutions, and varying degrees of
deoxygenation. Despite the biological significance of rare and unnatural sugars, synthetic challenges limit access
to these important molecules. Due to their functional group density and stereochemical complexity, current
syntheses of rare and unnatural sugars require multistep chemical synthesis, and commonly rely on protecting
group manipulations to achieve selective reaction outcomes. New, selective methods are needed for the
expedient synthesis of pyranose and furanose sugars. This proposal describes the development of selective
radical reactions to transform unprotected and minimally protected carbohydrates into diversely functionalized
monosaccharides and glycans. We specifically target epimerization reactions and radical rearrangements to
achieve broad synthetic access to rare isomeric and deoxygenated sugars, respectively. Using state-of-the-art
synthetic, mechanistic and theoretical tools, our approach involves the identification of new catalytic strategies
to control bond breaking, bond forming, and radical reorganization steps within the context of complex glycan
molecular frameworks. The successful development of this proposed research is anticipated to transform
carbohydrate synthesis, dramatically reducing the time and resources necessary to access these complex
pharmacophores. Fundamental mechanistic findings revealed en route to this goal are further anticipated to
contribute significantly to our understanding of carbohydrate reactivity patterns and to lay the groundwork for
catalytic approaches to selective radical functionalization reactions, more broadly."

Xenograft cell transplantation has transformed our understanding of human disease and has been used
extensively to assess regeneration, stem cell self-renewal, and cancer. Yet, mouse xenograft studies are
expensive and not easily amenable to imaging engraftment at single cell resolution. By contrast, zebrafish are
inexpensive, can be reared in large numbers, and are capable of real-time imaging of fluorescent-labeled cells
at single cell resolution. Our group has recently pioneered the use of adult immune-deficient zebrafish for
xenograft transplantation of human cancers and blood cells when reared at 37OC. Despite these successes,
more needs to be done to develop the next generation of immune compromised zebrafish for long-term
xenograft cell transplantation studies. The long-term goal of our work is to develop a universal zebrafish
transplantation model to engraft of a wide array of human regenerative and cancer cell types. The overall
objective is i) to develop new immune deficient zebrafish models for optimized xenograft engraftment of human
cancer, embryonic and induced-pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPSCs), and blood cells and ii) provide much
needed tools, methods, and cell biological readouts to directly assess pharmacodynamic responses to
radiation, drugs, and cell biological immunotherapies in vivo. The rationale for our research is that zebrafish
blood development is highly conserved and that developing zebrafish transplantation models will provide new
tools to rapidly assess preclinical therapies in vivo and at single cell resolution. Aim 1 will develop compound
mutant and transgenic zebrafish for optimized xenograft cell transplantation. We will develop new models that
lack T, B, NK, and macrophage cell function and that transgenically express human cytokines to support the
growth of human blood. We will also generate knock-in “genotype-less rag2∆/∆, il2rga−/− zebrafish” to increase
throughput in identifying double homozygous mutant animals. Aim 2 will test these models for enhanced
engraftment of human cancers, ES, iPSCs, and blood cells. This work is important, because it will provide
novel models and experimental protocols to engraft a wide array of regenerative cell types. Aim 3 will
dynamically visualize xenograft single cell responses to radiation, combination drug therapies, and
immunotherapy in preclinical modeling studies. This work will provide much needed cell biological readouts to
directly assess pharmacodynamic responses at single cell resolution across a wide array of therapies. These
same imaging tools and approaches can be used in many xenograft models – including patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs), ES/IPSCs, and blood. Our work is significant because it will develop the next generation
of low-cost, high throughput cell transplantation models that allow direct visualization of engrafted cell
behaviors in the context of preclinical therapies. This work will have a positive translational impact by
developing preclinical animal models that efficiently engraft a wide array of human tissues. Such broad
reaching applications for immune compromised zebrafish spans the mission of many NIH institutes."

Around 10% of reproductive-age women have endometriosis, although prevalence is thought to differ by
ancestry, with rates the highest in Asians where around 15% of women are affected. The molecular drivers of
this common chronic gynecologic condition are poorly understood, particularly in non-Whites. Endometriosis is
a major cause of pain and infertility in women, is associated with significant financial burden, and multiple
comorbidities including pain syndromes, inflammatory and immune conditions, anxiety, and depression.
Endometriosis lesions frequently harbor somatic mutations in “driver” genes such as KRAS, PIK3CA and
ARID1A, but the consequences of these mutations are poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to
leverage a deeply annotated collection of specimens from >1,400 endometriosis patients to catalogue the
spectrum of of somatic mutations in endometriosis across White, Asian, Black and Hispanic Women and to use
state-of-the-art single cell and spatial genomics technologies to identify therapeutic opportunities associated
with specific mutations. Aim 1 will use exome and targeted sequencing to map population-specific frequencies
of somatic drivers. Aim 2 will profile endometriosis and eutopic endometrium tissues using single cell
transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses and spatial transcriptomics to map the cellular and molecular impacts
of somatic mutations to identify therapeutic targets. Aim 3 will use an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of
endometriosis to validate the mechanisms by which mutations impact endometriosis formation and persistence
and to test therapeutics tailored to the genetic alterations in the lesions. Genes and pathways we discover to
be associated with somatic mutation of ARID1A, KRAS and other genes in endometriosis represent novel
opportunities for diagnosis and personalized treatment based on the specific landscape of a woman’s disease."

10781751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disorder affecting more than 8% of the general population
and two-three times as many women as men. Deficits in fear extinction, which refers to the learned inhibition of
fear responses, and fear extinction recall, which refers to the retention of this learned inhibition over time, play
a critical role in PTSD. Interventions that target fear extinction learning are first-line treatments for PTSD, but
they are only partially effective. To develop new and enhanced interventions, we need a better understanding
of the factors that influence fear extinction processes in PTSD in both females and males. One such factor is
inflammation, which is elevated in response to acute psychological stress and in PTSD. Preclinical models
indicate that elevated inflammation in general, and elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-
6 (IL-6) in particular, can impair fear extinction. People with PTSD and women may be more sensitive to the
effects of inflammatory activity on fear extinction. Our long-term goal is to uncover the mechanistic role that
inflammation plays in PTSD in order to identify effective primary and adjunctive anti-inflammatory interventions.
Our objective in this proposal is to determine the effects of acute inflammatory challenge on fear extinction
processes in trauma-exposed women and men with and without PTSD. Our central hypothesis is that acute
inflammatory challenge will impair fear extinction processes, with particularly strong effects in people with
chronic PTSD and women. Our aims are to: 1) determine the effects of acute inflammatory challenge on fear
extinction processes in individuals with and without PTSD; 2) examine if increases in inflammatory activity
mediate associations between acute inflammatory challenge and fear extinction processes; and 3) elucidate
sex differences in the effects of acute inflammatory challenge on fear extinction processes. In our proposed
study, we will use polysaccharide typhoid vaccine, which our preliminary data support as a robust acute
inflammatory challenge, and a fear-conditioning paradigm that we have used in >200 people with PTSD.
Participants will first undergo fear acquisition (i.e., fear learning). Then, three days later, following
consolidation, they will receive either vaccine or placebo; 4.5 hours later, when inflammatory activity is robustly
increased, participants will go through the fear extinction phase of the protocol, and one week later, the
extinction recall phase, with outcomes indexed by the skin conductance response (SCR). Inflammatory
markers will be measured at baseline prior to fear acquisition, pre- and 4.5 hours post vaccine/placebo prior to
fear extinction, and prior to extinction recall. This proposal is significant and innovative because it would be the
first study to examine the effects of acute inflammatory activity on fear extinction processes in trauma-exposed
individuals with and without PTSD, and it has potential to elucidate biological mechanisms of impaired fear
extinction, uncover sex differences, and point us in the direction of novel interventions to treat PTSD."
10779405,"Primary mitochondrial disease has an overall incidence of ~1:5000, and manifests as a decrease in the capacity
for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos). Skeletal muscle (SkM) is highly affected, leading to
mitochondrial myopathy (MM). A hallmark of SkM is that it can oxidize both glucose and fatty acids (FA) for ATP
synthesis. Glucose uptake in SkM substantially depends on insulin signaling which is feedback-inhibited by FA
derivatives, especially when FA supply exceeds oxidation, as likely occur when oxphos is deficient. Lipid
overload can also cause endoplasmic reticulum stress. Yet the fate of circulating FA substrates has been largely
ignored in MM, but has implications for the ability to sustain elevated glycolysis in MM and to trigger, or worsen,
cell stress responses. The overarching questions of this project are, “How is FA substrate handled when oxphos
is deficient, and how is that handling relevant in the adaptation to mitochondrial dysfunction including the
increased reliance on glycolysis?”. We hypothesize that substrate metabolism in an organism with MM is rewired
such that the liver and heart acquire greater roles to handle FA; this multi-organ compensation would mitigate
lipid burden and reductive stress in oxphos-deficient SkM. We further hypothesize that FGF21, derived from
oxphos-deficient SkM from activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), acts on the liver and heart to effect
a tighter muscle-liver/heart metabolic coupling that favors better adaptation to defective oxphos. We will test
these hypotheses using SkM-specific, and then combined liver/SM models of MM, namely mice with deficient
oxphos in SkM due to SkM-specific loss of the mitochondrial phosphate carrier, PiC, or mice deficient in a
mitochondrial quality control protein. Aim 1 will determine the fate of FA substrate in oxphos-deficient SkM and
oxphos-competent liver and heart, using FA tracers and by measuring β-oxidation intermediates in SkM, liver,
heart and serum. β-oxidation flux will be inferred using a novel approach that couples correlation analysis with
metabolite abundance, complemented by ex vivo β-oxidation flux by isotope tracing. Variables to be considered:
level of dietary fat; ATP demand (rest vs. exercise); need for FGF21; oxphos competence of liver. Aim 2 tests
the hypothesis that insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which can be inhibited by cytosolic lipids, in oxphos-
deficient SkM depends on the ability of the liver and heart for greater storage and oxidation of FA, and that, at
later stages of MM, this ability depends on FGF21. This will be tested using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
along with radiolabeled glucose and non-metabolizable glucose analog to evaluate glucose disposal, glucose
uptake into SkM, liver, heart and adipose tissues, and hepatic glucose production. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis
that ISR activation is sensitive to lipids in oxphos-deficient SkM, thus serving as a driver of FGF21 production
and secretion that mitigates lipid accumulation in oxphos-deficient SkM. We expect these studies to reveal how
FA substrate is handled in the context of 1° mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a major unanswered question,
and to provide insight into the implications of FA handling on major cellular responses to oxphos deficiency."
10781931,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Ribosomes are complex ribonucleoprotein particles that catalyze protein synthesis in almost
all cells in nature. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how the 80 proteins and
four rRNAs comprising eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled in vivo. We use the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to facilitate molecular genetic approaches, and cultured Hela cells to
enable us to visualize the nucleolus, the cellular compartment where ribosomes are made.
 Production of ribosomes is tightly linked to cell growth and proliferation. Consequently,
dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar integrity is linked to many diseases such as
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, or developmental disorders. Because pathways of
ribosome biogenesis are very conserved, our studies in yeast will help understand mechanisms
of regulation and dysregulation of ribosome production in humans.
 Ribosome biogenesis requires a dynamic series of remodeling steps in which protein and RNA
interactions are established and reconfigured. These steps are made more efficient and more
accurate by the activities of more than 200 assembly factors present in nascent yeast ribosomes,
which are required for their assembly, and conserved across eukaryotes.
 To enable in-depth studies of mechanisms driving ribosome assembly, we focus on one
interval: just prior to, during, and immediately after exit of large ribosomal subunit precursors
from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm. During this stage, several domains of ribosomal RNA
are rearranged, numerous assembly factors complete their functions and exit from pre-ribosomes,
and new assembly factors enter the particles. We want to learn how these dynamic remodeling
steps are powered forward by energy-consuming assembly factors present at this stage.
 We are also investigating interconnections between ribosome assembly and the nucleolus, the
prominent biomolecular condensate thought to be formed through multivalent interactions
between pre-ribosomes and other nucleolar components. However, it is not clear exactly how
ribosome assembly creates a nucleolus, nor how material properties of the nucleolus enable
efficient ribosome assembly.
 We propose experiments to address the following questions: (1) How do the RNA
helicases/ATPases Drs1, Has1, Dbp10, and Spb4 power maturation of pre-60S subunits during
mid to late nucleolar stages of assembly? (2) How does the structure and composition of pre-
ribosomes enable them to be retained in the nucleolus? (3) How does ribosome assembly
contribute to the morphology and fluidity of the nucleolus?"
10931528,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – OUTREACH CORE
The Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s geographic area is
composed of San Diego and Imperial Counties, the two U.S.-Mexico border counties in California which
include ~3.5 million residents. This region is a majority-minority area, with extensive cultural, linguistic, and
racial/ethnic diversity. Disparities in cancer risk factors, screening, treatment and survivorship continue to
persist nationally and within the Partnership’s region, particularly among underserved groups. Generally,
medically underserved individuals are diagnosed with cancer at a later stage and have poorer survival
compared to individuals who are more affluent. Reducing these cancer disparities requires capacity
development for evidence-based practice and community-engaged research and practice dissemination. There
is also a need for greater engagement and training of researchers from under-represented backgrounds to
collaborate with community organizations that serve this population. Further, communities rarely have
opportunities to develop research programs and implement evidence-based practices in collaboration with
expert clinicians and researchers. Using innovative approaches that are integrated into all Partnership
components, the Outreach Core addresses these gaps through its overarching goal: To integrate community
engagement principles into all CREATE Partnership activities. To accomplish this, the Outreach Core will
adopt the Community-to-Bench model, which provides an intentional effort to ensure community engagement
and bi-directional dialogue. The following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Advance cancer health equity by
facilitating and supporting catchment area-relevant research and community-engaged research including but
not limited to Partnership-sponsored research projects; 2) Provide support to community health centers for
screening, early detection, linkage to care and referral pathways; 3) Foster community engagement by
conducting needs assessments, disseminating evidence-based practices and resources and implementing
educational and outreach activities; and 4) Contribute to the Partnership’s educational mission by providing
educational opportunities to undergraduate, graduate and medical students, as well as early-stage
investigators in areas of community-engaged research and cancer disparities. Working closely with the
Community Advisory Board, the OC will build upon existing community partnerships to further expand the
Partnership’s outreach activities with underserved communities and to support research in catchment area
priority cancers. To conduct this work, the Core has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in
cancer disparities research, prevention, multilevel interventions, and community health system interventions.
The Core’s collaborative approach is responsive to community needs and will improve cancer health equity in
the Partnership’s region and beyond."

10896209,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
While currently available antiretrovirals block viral replication and thus control HIV-1 infection, they do not cure
the disease; latent reservoirs of replication-competent virus persist. To eradicate HIV-1 infection, novel antiretro-
virals must be developed. These drugs would ideally induce the killing of infected cells once latency is reversed.
An attractive direction in developing such antiretrovirals is the inhibition of the HIV-1 Nef protein. By modulating
surface-levels of immune receptors, Nef enables infected cells to evade host defense mechanisms. Among the
many functions of Nef, surface downregulations of CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)
are the most prominent and presumably most relevant in antiretroviral drug discovery. By downregulating CD4
from the cell surface, Nef enables CD4-induced epitopes of the viral Env protein to remain concealed, which
renders infected cells less sensitive to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). By downregulating
MHC-I, Nef disrupts host antigen presentation so that infected cells are protected from killing by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs). Conceivably, therapeutic inhibition of these Nef functions may restore the activities of
ADCC and CTLs, thus facilitating the detection and clearance of infected cells. Crystal structures solved by us
showed that Nef-mediated downregulations of CD4 and MHC-I involve a common site on Nef. In each case,
however, this site is remodeled by Nef’s association with target-specific, hijacked clathrin adaptor proteins (APs)
to uniquely accommodate the intended substrate. Furthermore, when bound to Nef, both the CD4 cytosolic tail
and the MHC-I cytosolic tail adopt curved, near-circular postures, which suggests that this multifunctional site of
Nef can be targeted by cyclic peptides, a promising new class of therapeutics well-suited to disrupt protein-
protein interactions. Supported by promising preliminary data, this project aims to develop small-sized macrocy-
clic peptides capable of mimicking the cytosolic tails of CD4 and MHC-I and thus blocking the cellular activities
of Nef through inhibition of Nef-mediated protein-protein interactions. High-affinity cyclopeptide Nef inhibitors will
be developed through enabling-strategies recently established in our laboratories. Specifically, a powerful phage
display platform will be applied to optimize CD4-mimetic cyclopeptide inhibitors that can bind to the Nef/AP2
complex with high affinity. In parallel, a similar workflow will be applied to develop and optimize MHC-I-mimetic
cyclopeptides into potent inhibitors that can block recruitment of MHC-I into the Nef/AP1 complex. High-resolu-
tion structures of the cyclopeptide-Nef complexes will be obtained to enable structure-based optimization of the
Nef inhibitors. Using a panel of cell-based assays, these compounds will be characterized for their efficacy in
blocking Nef functions in cells, cell permeability, and cellular toxicity, and this knowledge will be leveraged to
guide further derivatization for improved cellular activity. Successful completion of this work should yield cyclic
peptide-based Nef inhibitors with high affinity in vitro and significant efficacy in cells, which could ideally be
developed into novel antiretrovirals with unique therapeutic potentials."

addition, it will provide bioinformatics, statistical and methodological support for all the cancer research projects
proposed, as well as future projects that will build upon them and disseminate to all CaRE2 Center members and
the scientific community at large in a timely fashion. We will reach these goals through three aims: First, we will
provide bioinformatics, statistical and methodological support. This first aim established the job scheduling and
interfaces to meet the needs of all CaRE2 Health Equity Center investigators. We will support bioinformatics and
statistical issues across the projects and cores. Bioinformatics support will include in-depth quality control and
assessment of all high-throughput sequencing data from multiple platforms and facilitate access to publicly
available datasets. Statistical and methodological support will consist of all aspects, from collecting to state-of-
the-art data analysis and interpretation and abstract, manuscript, and grant preparation. The second aim will be
enhancing and maintaining a federated data repository resource that enables the interaction of CaRE2 members.
This second aim ensures that all data are of high quality and disseminated to all CaRE2 Center members and
the scientific community promptly. In the third aim, we will provide bioinformatics, statistical and methodological
support, and educational opportunities to the CaRE2 Center. This third aim focuses on developing online
educational materials that BSMC's members and guest experts will present through the core events, such as
seminar series and interactive lectures among all CaRE2 Center members."

Lung cancer is a prominent source of cancer health disparity, particularly in Black men. While they have lower
exposure to cigarette smoke, the most common risk factor for lung cancer, Black men have a 37% higher risk
for lung cancer than White men. In addition, the 5-year survival of Black men and women is below that of White
subjects. Numerous causes likely underlie these differences, including genetic differences. The latter may affect
the metabolism of nicotine/tobacco smoke components, responses to therapy, and differences in cancer driver
gene mutations. To understand the effects of the genetic differences between racial/ethnic groups on lung cancer
development and treatment, we need to characterize the driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, the
most common type of lung cancer) in Black Americans and develop in vitro lung cancer model systems that
reflect the relevant mutations in the correct genetic background. There is a notable lack of cell line models for
lung adenocarcinoma from Black Americans, with no Black cell lines from alveolar epithelial cells (the LUAD
progenitors) and only 5 known LUAD cell lines (compared to 67 White cell lines). While targeted therapies are
available for a subset of LUAD, in vitro systems to test therapeutics in Black Americans are sorely lacking. We
hypothesize that due to genetic differences, LUAD in Blacks will have a unique repertoire of cancer driver genes
and will respond to targeted therapies distinctly from white LUAD. This proposal represents an interdisciplinary
collaboration in which a medicinal (bio)chemist from FAMU (Dr. Lamango), a biomedical engineer from UF (Dr.
Huang), and a molecular geneticist from USC (Dr. Offringa) combine their innovative resources to tackle the
pronounced health disparities in lung cancer in Black Americans. We will do so through three Specific Aims: In
Aim 1, we will identify the main driver mutational signatures of lung adenocarcinoma from 100 Black Americans,
who are 5-fold underrepresented in mutational studies. In Aim 2, we will develop new immortalized alveolar and
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines from Black subjects and use these and existing cell lines to develop 2-
dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro models. We will test promising drugs (polyisoprenylated
cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs)) developed by the Lamango lab, that target the KRAS pathway which is
frequently mutated in LUAD. As time allows we will also test other targeted therapeutics and combinations of
drugs. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel 3D-printed bone cancer metastasis model to study the differential efficacy
of PCAIs and other targeted therapeutics on cancer cell cytotoxicity, migration, and invasion. Bone is the most
common metastatic site of LUAD. The three proposed Specific Aims address the lack of knowledge about cancer
driver genes in Black American lung adenocarcinoma, generate a collection of normal alveolar and lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines from Black subjects that will be used to establish race-appropriate models and will be
a great resource for others, and allow the testing of therapeutics on cells from Black Americans using 2D, 3D,

 Surveillance for cancer incidence and mortality is crucial to cancer control and cancer research. Cancer
registries are the basis for allocating public health resources as well as designing and assessing interventions
to control cancer morbidity and mortality through prevention, screening, and treatment. The most fundamental
aspect of any cancer registry is “completeness,” which is a measure of the proportion of true cancer cases
captured by a registry within a defined catchment area and period. In concept, completeness is a simple
proportion, equal to the number of cancer cases recorded in a registry divided by the true number of cancer
cases occurring in the catchment area over the period. Measuring cancer registry completeness is, however,
extremely challenging. A registry is meant to include all cancer cases, so the number of recorded cases is also
the best available measure of the true number. To address this fundamental problem, the most common
method to estimate completeness calculates the expected number of cancer registry cases and compares that
expected number to the reported number. These extant measures leave out the two most common cancers
(prostate and breast) as well as less common cancers and universally include data only from Black people and
White people, therefore routinely misestimating completeness for registries covering populations with high
proportions of Asian people, Native American people, and people of Hispanic ethnicity.
 We propose a new comprehensive method to address these shortcomings. Our method will allow
registries to determine which populations and geographic areas are contributing to a lack of completeness and
help them to identify strategies most likely to improve completeness going forward. Ours aims are: (a) Develop
methods for estimating registry-specific completeness specific to county, race and ethnicity, age, sex, cancer
site, and calendar year—borrowing information across categories in a principled way—and adjusting for time
trends in survival, reporting lags, and spatial correlation; (b) Develop methods to decompose completeness by
demographic (race/ethnicity and sex) and geographic (rural/urban) characteristics, allowing individual registries
to improve future completeness by targeting specific populations or regions for which data are less complete;
and (3) Adapt the completeness and decomposition methods to a user-friendly tool, featuring intuitive control
over model parameters, and guided, semi-automated code execution, and curated output to assure
transparency and reproducibility by cancer registries. By achieving these aims, this research project will (1)
improve the rigor and reproducibility of measurement of completeness for US cancer registries, (2) guide
choices of where registries can invest resources to optimize overall and group-specific completeness, (3)
demonstrate how differential lack of completeness has biased the current understanding of cancer disparities,
and (4) provide transparent and replicable computational resources linked with easily updated data sources."

The Alzheimer’s Association’s 2019 Facts and Figures Report reports that while a cognitive assessment is
required for all Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, only 16% of surveyed older adults reported having any form of
memory assessment. While standardized neuropsychological tasks are sensitive to gross memory deficits, they
are not as sensitive to milder deficits associated with healthy aging or early disease stages and they are often
poorly suited for routine testing outside of trained neuropsychologist practitioners. Thus, there is a critical need
for an easy-to administer, reliable, and sensitive measure of hippocampal memory function for clinical use. We
have designed the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST), a modified object recognition memory task, to provide not
only a traditional measure of object recognition memory, but also a measure of “mnemonic discrimination” that
is highly sensitive hippocampal function by placing strong demands on pattern separation. Thus, the goal of this
proposal is to complete the development and validation of version of the clinical MST (cMST) as a fully
encapsulated tool that would be ready for use in clinical research and for evaluation as a routine clinical tool.
First, we will develop an optimized version of the MST designed for clinical use as a sensitive assay of
hippocampal function that rapidly, but robustly, estimates hippocampal memory performance. The design goals
are that it is: 1) easy to administer in a short amount of time, 2) has clear scoring and interpretation of results, 3)
is sensitive to modest hippocampal dysfunction, 4) demonstrates reliability, and 5) exhibits general utility across
a range of racial/ethnic/age groups. At the core of the MST is the use of highly similar lure items that have a
range of pre-determined “mnemonic similarity” to the original studied item. We have now developed a version of
the MST that uses a continuous recognition memory format and optimizes the distribution of targets, foils, and
lures, along with the mnemonic similarity of those lures, for use in the cMST. Here, we will determine whether
that is an ideal format or whether a Bayesian adaptive version is superior.
Then we will establish normative data on the cMST across the lifespan and in early dementia. In Aim 2.1, we will
evaluate the sensitivity and validity of the cMST to memory decline in healthy aging, comparing it to the standard
research-grade MST and to traditional neuropsychological tests in a large lifespan sample. Repeat testing of
individuals will be used to establish reliability and assess practice effects. We will use these data to create
normative data. In Aim 2.2, we will extend these investigations to clinical populations - specifically to those with
Mild Cognitive Impairment or early AD through the UCI Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) to
determine both viability and normative performance of our measures in these impaired populations and
diagnostic ability of the cMST. By working with our ADRC for testing both healthy and impaired individuals, we
will gain access to a host of other existing biomarkers of hippocampal decline available in this cohort, such as
word recall, CSF tau levels, and hippocampal volume measures via structural MRI.
Finally, we will create a model for large-scale distribution of the cMST via online administration. The ultimate
goal of this proposal is to create an encapsulated version of the cMST that can be adopted for clinical use that
is independent of a research lab. In Aim 3, we will distribute this task via a downloadable link that can be used
on either desktop/laptop devices or on touchscreen tablets to a large and diverse sample. UCI’s large Consent
2 Contact (C2C) database (N=3250) provides an outstanding test case for large-scale data collection outside of
a clinical or lab-based setting and for testing its potential use as a diagnostic screening tool."

Despite extensive investigations into the effects of radiation on normal tissues, there is currently no easy way
to quickly determine if a person has been exposed to radiation, to what dose and type, and if they are likely to
suffer serious acute or delayed consequences. Time may also be of the essence for triaging large numbers of
individuals and with that in mind have developed a robust infrastructure for the discovery and development of a
novel biodosimeter that offers a compelling solution; namely circulating microRNA (miRNA) profiling. It is
based on our extensive experience in studying survivors of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) in murine and
non-human primate models, and our understanding of the road toward the development of delayed effects,
which don’t follow the same strict time-dose constraints as ARS. Instead, they display common patterns of
inflammation and aberrant immune engagement, leading to late tissue toxicity and premature death. Our
hypothesis is that radiation-induced systemic myeloid cell mobilization and immunohematopoietic imbalance
drive late radiation damage that, remarkably, occurs only in some mice and not in others. We have compelling
evidence that dynamic events at the irradiated tissue-immune interface are reflected in a measurable shift in
the circulating miRNAs landscape suggesting that they 1) go hand-in-hand with the initial radiation insult and 2)
precede late tissue-specific radiation-induced toxicities such as fibrosis in heart and lung.
Against this backdrop we propose to develop a panel of miRNAs and build a comprehensive biomarker
platform that integrates signals from both acute and late radiation damage. Our goal is to extend our existing
knowledge from low LET exposures and determine if known patterns of miRNA changes are inherently
different for radiation of different qualities, and if the nature of the associated tissue damage also changes. In
Aim 1 we will determine broad parameters such as dose-rate and time that define radiation-induced tissue
damage in the aftermath of hematopoietic ARS caused by X-rays versus neutron exposures. We will rely on
proven, robust endpoints such clinical examination, blood work and necropsy amongst other, more tissue
specific readouts to capture multi-organ disease. Longitudinal plasma miRNA profiles will be generated for
each mouse as part of Aim 2 and aligned within the context of tissue damage to identify putative biomarker
candidates to achieve our ultimate goal and build a biomarker panel for tissue- and radiation-specific damage
(Aim 3). The study has broad relevance to acute and chronic radiation effects and it epitomizes the complex
interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis. We are mindful of the challenges
that arise when comparing X-rays with neutrons using in vivo irradiation and the complexities that are inherent
in studying late morbidities. We therefore assembled a team that combines expertise in radiation biology,
immunology, miRNA profiling, radiation physics and dosimetry, veterinary care and statistics to cover all
aspects of this research."

and suffer higher mortality rates than other populations. The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors
(ROCS) study (U01CA199240) is the largest single cohort of African American cancer survivors aimed
at understanding the multiplex causes of poorer outcomes in this population. Detroit ROCS has been
collecting survey data and biospecimens with a goal of enrolling 5,000 population-based African
Americans diagnosed with lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers and any early-
onset cancer (diagnosed age 20-49 years) and supporting studies addressing determinants of cancer
outcomes and quality of life. In this renewal application, we will continue to follow cohort survivors
annually for up to 9 years to address the determinants of longer term outcomes (e.g., disease
recurrence, second primary diagnoses, treatment related comorbidities and death) and quality of life.
The broad research agenda will be developed with our community partners. We propose to: 1) conduct
annual follow-up surveys on all living, enrolled participants for up to five additional years and collect
additional biospecimens; 2) engage with members of the community to set new research priorities and
to obtain input into the retention of participants and dissemination of research findings back to the

10776161,"PROJECT SUMMARY Drosophila research labs routinely maintain hundreds to thousands of unique strains.
Not only is this practice labor and resource intensive, but there is a risk that valuable strains will be lost,
contaminated, or acquire additional mutations. This limitation would be overcome by the implementation of
Drosophila cryopreservation methods. Cryopreservation of Drosophila embryos was first reported nearly 30
years ago, with subsequent optimization that enables preservation of both wild type and transgenic lines. Broad
implementation of these cryopreservation technologies has not yet been realized. This may be due in part to
complex methodologies utilizing toxic solvents and desiccation steps required to permeabilize the embryos to
cryoprotective agents (CPAs). Recently, our lab has developed an embryo permeabilization solution that is free
of harsh solvents, does not require desiccation or manual mixing, and has been semi-automated using syringe
pumps. We have demonstrated in preliminary data that this approach successfully enables cryopreservation of
Drosophila embryos that develop into adults and produce offspring. In the present technology driven proposal,
our overall goal is now to develop a fully autonomous fluidic device capable of performing all liquid handling
steps (i.e. dechorionation, permeabilization and CPA loading) required in the cryopreservation protocol. Here,
no external computers or mechanical systems are required, as the device automatically times and performs
liquid handling using only power from house vacuum lines. This is significant, as it eliminates high upfront costs
associated with the fluidic system, reduces user-error, requires less labor and resources, and can be multiplexed.
We anticipate this approach will result in an accessible, affordable technology that can be broadly implemented
by the research community regardless of laboratory size or operating budget.
Key deliverables for this focused technology award include i) a robust and simple chemical process that enables
permeabilization and CPA uptake in Drosophila embryos and ii) an autonomous fluidic device that enables
precise timing and delivery of reagents. The scientific team is well-suited to perform the work described in this
proposal and includes experts in chemistry and cryobiology (Sandlin), Drosophila biology (White) and
engineering (Toner). Our work will be completed through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will focus on
optimization of the chemical process for the cryopreservation procedure (e.g. permeabilization, CPA loading,
etc.). In Aim 2, we will fabricate and validate the fluidic device to achieve full automation of complex liquid
handling steps. In Aim 3 we will complete a validation study and disseminate the technology. Specifically, we
will integrate best practices from Aims 1/2 to validate the fully automated procedure against a larger panel of
Drosophila strains. Our goal is to maintain ≥60% survival of thawed embryos to adults relative to non-preserved
controls. We will further work with three outside Drosophila labs to identify and address variables that may
impact full use and broad implementation of this technology."

Asthma affects 9% of adolescents in the United States and is a leading cause of youth morbidity. National
asthma guidelines emphasize the importance of asthma self-management behaviors to control asthma and
promote quality of life. Adolescents have suboptimal adherence to asthma self-management behaviors driven
by an underdeveloped and highly variable capacity to self-regulate cognitions, emotions, and behaviors; and a
normative decrease in parental support while multiple demands are increasing. Each adolescent experiences
different threats to their ability to self-regulate at different moments in time, necessitating personalized and
adaptive self-regulatory support to increase daily self-management behaviors and achieve sustained asthma
control. Smartphones are an optimal mechanism for improving adolescent adherence, however, existing
asthma self-management apps do not combine what is known about evidence-based behavior change
strategies and adaptive intervention technologies that tailor the experience based on user data. Our team
recently developed Responsive Asthma Care for Teens (ReACT; R56 HL141394), a technological ecosystem
including a smartphone app, mobile sensors to assess medication dosing, a Smarthub to achieve real-time
data listening, and cloud-based intervention delivery algorithms. ReACT provides personalized and adaptive
self-regulatory support to improve asthma self-management via goal-setting, feedback, and barrier
identification with problem-solving skills. Results of our pilot work demonstrated that ReACT was acceptable
and produced post-intervention changes in our hypothesized mechanisms of self-regulation and problem-
solving skills. The proposed study will optimize ReACT based on lessons learned from our pilot work and
updated national asthma guidelines. We will conduct an unbalanced (2:1) randomized pilot trial to examine
feasibility of our multisite trial protocol, determine if ReACT produces a clinically significant effect on proximal
mechanisms hypothesized to drive asthma control, and explore the impact of ReACT on asthma control and
asthma-related quality of life. Adolescents ages 13-17 with suboptimal asthma control (n=120) will be
randomized to ReACT or a mHealth control condition stratified by regimen for 6-months. Adolescents in the
control condition will receive an app that includes static asthma education information and a form for recording
symptoms and adherence. The control condition is designed to mirror standard of care, optimize recruitment,
and sustain interest while concurrently having a minimal impact on asthma management. Assessments will
occur at baseline, 3-month, and post-intervention (6-month) time points. Mechanisms of intervention effect will
be collected via both self-report (e.g., self-regulation) and objective (e.g., medication adherence) assessments.
We will assess planned future clinical trial outcomes (e.g., asthma control and asthma-related quality of life) to
provide effect size estimates for future work. We will have the necessary and sufficient information about the
feasibility of our multisite clinical trial protocol and planned analyses at the end of this project."

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and resultant coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has caused a global health crisis, surpassing 100 million infections in the United States. SARS-
CoV-2 infections range from asymptomatic to respiratory failure and death, and can result in an array of long-
term effects collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). The
pathobiological mechanisms and environmental factors underlying the intensity and duration of these effects
remain unclear, but a range of chronic lung impairments that resemble complications associated with age-related
pulmonary fibrosis have been documented in severe COVID-19, suggesting that environmental drivers
implicated in pulmonary fibrosis may also influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. We have
identified the environmental constituent chitin as a candidate environmental driver of persistent SARS-CoV-2-
induced disease, consistent with its previously described role in pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary studies show
that chitin spontaneously accumulates in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, and is accompanied by
alterations in the expression patterns of the major lung chitinase, AMCase, suggesting that chitin-chitinase
interactions may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. In comparison with wild-type (WT) controls, mice that
genetically lack AMCase exhibit exacerbated lung pathology after infection with SARS-CoV-2, implicating chitin
and chitinases in the pathologic sequelae that occur during the recovery phase. Thus, we hypothesize that
environmental chitin can drive COVID-19 severity, epithelial dysregulation, and disease persistence, and that
epithelial chitinases attenuate this process by degrading chitin. In this project, we leverage recently developed
mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and chitin exposure to delineate a host-environmental interaction that
may contribute to persistent lung impairments following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will test our hypothesis by
addressing two Aims: (1) determine the influence of environmental chitin on the severity and persistence of lung
pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (2) define the role of mammalian chitinases in SARS-CoV-2 infection
and persistent lung disease. Understanding how environmental chitin influences long-lasting pathologic
responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets
associated with differential disease outcomes in COVID-19 and PASC."

 For patients with end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation is the best clinical treatment.
While this procedure improves kidney function and survival in these patients, kidney
transplantation is also associated with an increase in cardiometabolic disease, which includes
glucose intolerance/insulin resistance that leads to development of diabetes mellitus, which may
impact on the transplanted kidney. Weight and adipose gain following kidney transplantation has
been implicated for these deleterious cardiometabolic effects, and potential impact on kidney
function and kidney graft failure. The increase in weight/adiposity may be related to a combination
of medications related to transplantation and/or positive energy balance resulting from an
increase in energy intake without a sufficient compensatory increase in energy expenditure (e.g.,
increased physical activity). Interventions to address weight gain have focused on the prevention
of positive energy balance (energy intake does not exceed energy expenditure). There is a
scarcity of rigorous data available in the literature addressing dietary interventions and the effect
on body weight following kidney transplantation. The existing literature of diet or diet plus physical
activity has moderate to high risks of bias that limit the use for drawing conclusions on prevention
of weight gain and related onset of impaired glucose metabolism. We propose a study of high
scientific rigor to address this limitations in an effort to enhance the health of kidney transplant
recipients.
 We propose this study to build on our intervention and clinical experience to conduct a 6-
month pilot and feasibility study in patients who have received a kidney transplant. We will initially
undertake efforts to refine our intervention components to confirm their applicability to this patient
population. We will the recruit and randomize participants to Standard Care or a Lifestyle
Intervention focus on weight gain prevention. The aims of this study are: 1) We will adapt our
intervention approach to this patient population, 2) We will examine the feasibility of randomizing
and retaining participants within our approach, 3) We will examine fidelity and compliance to the
components of the intervention, 4) We will conduct safety monitoring to assess for adverse
outcomes that are specific to kidney transplantation. Based on this pilot and feasibility clinical trial,
and our “Go/No Go” criteria, we will finalize the study protocol, manual of procedures, and effect
size estimates for a subsequent full-scale R01 application."

This goal of this project is to investigate neuroinflammation in Parkinson disease (PD) using positron emission
tomography (PET) with a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) specific radiotracer [11C]CS1P1.
Neuroinflammation is a key element in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, thus quantitative measures of
neuroinflammation provide key evidence for pathogenesis, identification of therapeutic targets and quantification
of target engagement in PD. S1PR1 is the most abundant receptor in the S1P receptor 5 member family. In the
central nervous system (CNS), S1PR1 is expressed in neurons and glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia,
and oligodendrocytes. Dysregulation of S1PR1 signaling plays a critical pathophysiological role in inflammatory
diseases in the CNS. We reported that [11C]CS1P1, previously called [11C]TZ3321, specifically targets S1PR1
receptors with increased uptake at sites of inflammation in three animal models of inflammatory disease. We
had received FDA approval of [11C]CS1P1 for human use (IND#:146548) and completed whole body dosimetry
PET scans for 5 male and 5 female normal healthy participants, and brain PET scans in 10 MS patients; our
results demonstrated that [11C]CS1P1 PET is able to detect neuroinflammation in MS. Macaques with a unilateral
nigrostriatal brain injury, caused by intracarotid (ic) infusion of the neurotoxin MPTP, were used to directly
compare brain uptake of [11C]CS1P1 with the widely used neuroinflammation tracer [11C]PBR28. Four macaques
were scanned with each tracer under baseline conditions and following unilateral injury. Surprisingly, 6-8 weeks
after MPTP-induced injury, both radiotracers had increased cortical brain uptake demonstrating a robust
neuroinflammatory response that highly correlated with each other (r2 = 0.7-0.8). However, when compared with
baseline imaging, the post-MPTP increase in ipsilateral frontal cortex compared to contralateral cortex for
[11C]CS1P1 (89%) significantly exceeded that for [11C]PBR28 (12%). Therefore, we propose to validate the PET
measures and systematically evaluate the ability of [11C]CS1P1 to quantitatively measure neuroinflammation
after MPTP-induced injury in macaques. We hypothesize that PET with the S1PR1 radiotracer [11C]CS1P1 can
quantify neuroinflammation in humans with PD. To test our hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. Aim-1# is
to investigate regional S1PR1 expression in the brain of MPTP-treated NHPs by longitudinal PET imaging and
terminal post-PET autoradiography, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, immunofluorescence (IF) analysis,
and ELISA studies of the brain tissues. Aim-2# is to investigate S1PR1 expression in the brains of PD patients
and healthy controls through PET imaging as well as in vitro studies of banked postmortem tissue from PD cases
and controls, including autoradiography, IHC staining, IF analysis and ELISA studies. We expect to demonstrate
that PET with [11C]S1P1 radiotracer can quantify neuroinflammation in PD and other neurodegenerative
diseases."

The Planning & Evaluation Core (P&E Core) of the Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research
between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) coordinates
critical functions necessary for the determination of the impact and effectiveness of Partnership activities in the
attainment of its goals and objectives. P&E Core Leads, Dr. Rachel Boren at NMSU and Dr. Julian Simon at
Fred Hutch have extensive expertise in program evaluation methodologies. Dr. Boren is Director of the
Southwest Outreach Academic Research (SOAR) Evaluation and Policy Center at New Mexico State
University and has been an evaluator for over 10 years. She has previously worked as an evaluator for the
Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) based at the University of Washington. Fred Hutch is affiliated
with the University of Washington and participates in the ITHS thus giving Dr. Boren a unique familiarity with
both institutions. Dr. Simon has served as Research Project and Core Lead as well currently serving as MPI for
the Partnership. His nearly 20-year involvement with the Partnership gives him a historical perspective on the
culture of the collaboration. The five Specific Aims of the P&E Core are to: 1. Provide assessment tools to
evaluate, track and report on progress in all aspects of the Partnership; 2. Release Requests for Applications
for new pilot and full Research Projects and conduct rigorous review of proposals; 3. Engage community
members and community action boards to evaluate impact of the Partnership on advancing regional cancer
health equity; 4. Convene IAC and PSC to review progress of Cores and Research Projects, and facilitate
communication between the advisory bodies, NCI and Core and Project Leads, and; 5. Evaluate the
implementation and impact of the Guiding Principles (described in detail in Overall). In order to accomplish
these Aims, the P&E Core will work with the MPIs (Drs. Graciela Unguez and Julian Simon) as well as
Research Project and Core Leads to develop appropriate evaluation instruments to inform on the effectiveness
of the Partnership’s activities. Quantitative and qualitative measure of outcomes will be collected and assessed
based on the metrics described in the Logic Model (see P&E Core). New Research Projects will be solicited,
evaluated, and implemented through the P&E Core. Current Research Projects and Cores will be evaluated
and if necessary revised in consultation with the Internal Advisory Committee, the Program Steering
Committee and NCI Program Staff. Rigorous review of the effectiveness of projects and activities will enable
progress to meeting the Partnership’s goal of advancing health equity in the communities served."

The goal of this project is to use a systematic and integrative computational approach in genomic analysis
to find novel genes, biological networks and pathways overlapping preeclampsia (PE) and prenatal
maternal asthma as a risk factor for both PE and childhood asthma. In this approach, we will integrate two
types of genomics data derived from Next-Generation Sequencing (mRNA-miRNA seq), to discover new
biological pathways conferring risk of childhood asthma. Specific aims rely on longitudinal high throughput
sequencing of maternal peripheral blood RNA at 10-18 and 32-38 weeks of pregnancies with asthma and
PE and cord blood at delivery in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART). We will
replicate the disease module and biological candidates in a second cohort of pregnancies (LifeCodes).
Successful achievement of the objective of this project will help to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis of
PE, and genomic factors contributing to both PE and maternal asthma during pregnancy as well as a future
plan for translation of these discoveries into clinical practice for prevention of PE and childhood asthma.
The project will be led by Hooman Mirzakhani, MD, PhD, MMSc who is an Instructor in Medicine at
Channing Division of Network Medicine Division (CDNM) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). During
his training, he has received a Master of Medical Science degree in Biomedical Informatics from Harvard
Medical School and a Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics from Leiden
University Medical Center, The Netherlands. At the CDNM, he has been pursing epidemiologic and
genomic investigations into the early origins of PE, asthma during pregnancy, role of vitamin D in asthma
and PE with a particular interest in secondary influences of asthma and vitamin D on PE development and
risk of childhood asthma. Dr. Mirzakhani plans to develop his career in the academic field of translational
biomedical science. Successful completion of this proposal will result in advanced training in systems biology
required for a future independent career as a scientist to elucidate the early origins of childhood asthma and
its prenatal risk factors including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy that cause maternal-fetal morbidity
and affect mother and neonates’ long-term health. Dr. Mirzakhani will use samples from the VDAART
study for the discovery phase and additional subjects’ samples for replication will be provided by Dr.
McElrath, PI of the LifeCodes cohort at Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at BWH. He will be mentored
and advised by Scott T. Weiss, MD, MS, and Joseph Loscalzo, MD, PhD, MA, Thomas F. McElrath, MD,
PhD, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, PhD, and Vincent J. Carey, PhD, a multidisciplinary team of experts and
leaders in clinical, biomedical, biostatistical and translational research with excellent track records of
mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers."
10756476,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed work will adapt current wearable, optically pumped magnetometer-based
magnetoencephalography (opmMEG) for use in infants, and will then further adapt these protocols for
simultaneous recording of brain activity in mother-infant dyads during naturalistic social interactions. While both
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been used to assess
brain function in infants, and EEG has even been used to simultaneously assess mother-infant dyad brain
function during naturalistic interactions, they each have limitations that are addressed by wearable opmMEG.
Both EEG and fMRI allow for high temporal, millisecond, resolution; however, EEG poses challenges for source
localization. Although fMRI addresses the source localization issues of EEG, it does not allow for the same
naturalistic social paradigms as EEG, and is also loud and expensive. OpmMEG is non-invasive, quiet, and
provides both high temporal resolution and accurate source localization. OPMs can be used at room
temperature, unlike other MEG sensors that must be cooled using expensive cryogens. OPMs are also small
and lightweight, making them amenable to use in wearable helmets, which can be used even during paradigms
that include participant motion. All of these characteristics of opmMEG make it an ideal candidate for adaptation
for use in infants, and further, use in naturally interacting mother-infant dyads. The ability to assess brain function
simultaneously within a mother-infant dyad represents an unprecedented opportunity to gain knowledge about
typical development, which is key to being able to recognize clinically relevant patterns of brain function indicative
of later emerging psychopathology. Once the proposed work is completed, we will have developed
optimized protocols, and the first-ever opmMEG data collected in an infant, as well as the first ever
simultaneous mother-infant opmMEG collected during naturalistic, physically-touching, social
interactions. The innovations represented by this proposal are paramount to moving the field of infant imaging
vertically to improve our understanding of neurodevelopment using salient social interactions that exist within
the developmentally unique and formative mother-infant dyad."
10756477,"Hypertension is a condition of premature vascular aging, relative to actual chronological age. In fact, many factors
that contribute to the deterioration of vascular function as we age are accelerated and exacerbated in hypertension.
Nonetheless, our understanding of the mechanisms that cause arteries to prematurely age, thus increasing the
cardiovascular risk for hypertensive patients, is yet to be determined. It is well established that the
upregulation/reconstitution of autophagy ameliorates the aged phenotype, especially in the vasculature. Nonetheless,
the precise mechanisms by which autophagy exerts anti-vascular aging effects, remain to be elucidated. Therefore,
the long-term objective of this project is to uncover novel mechanisms by which autophagy ameliorates premature
vascular aging associated with hypertension. Evolutionarily, autophagy serves to mobilize macro - and micronutrients
in times of starvation and stress. As a result, autophagy has also been recognized as a mediator of hepatic lipid
metabolism, which could then liberate substrates for ketogenesis. Previously, we made the seminal observation that
autophagy induces the biosynthesis of liver-derived ketone body, 􀈕-hydroxybutyrate (􀈕OHB). Furthermore, we have
observed that 􀈕OHB has profound anti-hypertensive effects, including potent vasodilation of isolated resistance
arteries, however, data collected from the K99 phase has suggested that this is through a non -canonical signaling
mechanism. Therefore, we hypothesize that upregulation of autophagy in liver, stimulates the production of 􀈕OHB,
which induces vasodilation, and decreases phenotypes of premature vascular aging associated with hypertension. We
will test this hypothesis by executing the following specific aims: 1) 􀈕OHB prevents vascular aging phenotypes by
stimulating vasodilation via direct activation of potassium channels on endothelial cells, and 2) decreased autophagic
activity in hypertension reduces 􀈕OHB biosynthesis, contributing to high blood pressure and premature vascular
aging. To execute these aims, we will investigate mice genetically deficient in specific potassium channels, mice
genetically deficient in autophagy protein Atg5, and genetically hypertensive rats. Hypertension will be induced in mice
via angiotensin II infusion. Collectively, this application proposes a novel, physiologic mechanism by which autophagy
in the liver prevents premature vascular aging and also proposes a pathogenic consequence of decreased autophagic
activity in hypertension. As vascular age is a new clinically used index for cardiovascular disease risk, understanding
these mechanisms may assist in the development of new therapies to reverse or prevent vascular damage associated
with hypertension. Given that hypertension is a major public health burden in the United States, our proposal is very
much in accordance with the mission of the National Institutes of Health."
10756995,"ABSTRACT – Medical Imaging Technology Development Core 
 The objective of the Medical Imaging Technology Development Core (MITDC) is to build an infrastructure to 
support research of the junior research project leaders (RPLs) and overarching goal of this COBRE. The Core 
will be built based on the OU Advanced Medical Imaging Center (OU-AMIC), which has been supported by both 
the Gallogly College of Engineering University of Oklahoma (OU) Norman campus and the Stephenson Cancer 
Center of OUHSC campus since 2012. OU-AIMC includes 5 research laboratories and an established network 
between the engineering and clinical expertise to facilitate the interdisciplinary research. OU-AIMC provides a 
solid foundation for this MITDC to provide important resource for RPLs and pilot project awardees of the COBRE. 
The MITDC Core has 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1: We will implement an interdisciplinary management plan to build 
an optimal infrastructure to support translational medical imaging related cancer research. The Core will be co- 
directed by an experienced engineer and a physician researcher. An advisory board of senior engineering and 
physician researchers will be established to guide the development and operation of the Core. Existing imaging 
equipment and other tools will be integrated to serve COBRE projects, along with equipment and services 
available by industry and clinical collaboration. Monthly brainstorming meetings, on demand tours, round table 
discussions, and biannual open house workshops will facilitate interaction between members of the Core and 
researchers on both OU Norman and OUHSC campuses. These activities will allow the Core to better understand 
researcher needs and provide opportunities for researchers to learn new imaging technologies that can benefit 
their research. Aim 2: We will design and develop a series of investigative imaging tools and testbeds to provide 
researchers fast and cost-effective methods to test their innovative research concepts. Using testbeds of new 
imaging modalities, the researchers will be able to acquire preliminary data to validate their hypotheses without 
the expensive and time-consuming development of a fully equipped laboratory. Based on the research areas of 
the initially selected RPL projects and other junior researchers in the COBRE pool, the testbeds will include, but 
are not limited to, phase-contrast X-ray imaging, X-ray fluorescence tomography, digital pathology scanners, 
and special optical imaging devices. Aim 3: We will build an integrated computer server/network and provide 
new computer-aided quantitative image feature analysis schemes and software to support the RPLs and other 
researchers to conduct large data and deep transfer learning-based Radiomics studies. This will improve the 
efficiency and consistency of developing and validating quantitative image markers and/or machine learning 
prediction models developed by different projects. In summary, MITDC will provide a unique research service 
and supporting capability to enhance the overarching goal of this COBRE. It will not merely be a collection of 
imaging equipment in a distinct space, it will also allow us to fully network our current research expertise to better 
support the translational cancer research using medical imaging technology to benefit patients in the future."

Sedentary behaviors (SB) are biologically distinct but understudied cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.
National and international agencies have surmised that the level of evidence for an overall and dose-response
association between SB and CVD mortality is moderate-strong. These agencies do not provide specific
recommendations for breaking-up SB, though do call on the research community to facilitate policy
development by establishing biological plausibility, identifying the optimal dose for SB substitution strategies,
and conducting randomized clinical trials to test the efficacy of these strategies. Our goal is to identify
mechanism-informed, socioecological-based SB substitution recommendations to mitigate CVD risk.
Aim 1A will identify a feasible SB substitution strategy to prevent the adverse cardiovascular responses to
prolonged SB. Adverse cardiovascular responses will be measured using aortic arterial stiffness (AS), a
noninvasive test that predicts future CVD. To accomplish this aim, in 56 middle-aged (36-55 years)
participants, we will measure aortic AS and associated mechanistic responses to the following over 4 hours: (i)
SB with once/hour 5 min walk break; (ii) SB with once/hour 15 min stand break; (iii) SB with twice/hour breaks
(alternating 5 min walk and 15 min stand); and (iv) SB with no breaks (control). These strategies were selected
based on extensive prior work by our group, and because they are feasible, which is a key component of this
proposal. SB reduction strategies will only decrease CVD risk if people are willing to adhere to future SB
substitution recommendations. To increase the likelihood of feasibility and long-term adherence, Aim 1B will
evaluate the determinants of SB using a socioecological model. This recognizes that behavior change is likely
to be limited if the physical and sociocultural environments do not support the behavior change. To accomplish
Aim 1B, a combined inductive-deductive qualitative approach will be used. Participants who complete Aim 1A
will be participate in one of 6 focus groups (6-8 participants/group). Aim 2A will then test the feasibility of
implementing the strategy in the real-world via an individualized single-arm 12-week intervention (n=40, 36-64
years). The mechanistic (Aim 1A) and qualitative (Aim 1B) data from Aim 1 will guide the intervention design.
We will test the following feasibility domains: demand, acceptability, implementation, practicality, integration,
and limited-efficacy. Lastly, Aim 2B will investigate which components of the intervention worked and which
components did not work. All participants who complete Aim 2A will be asked to complete questionnaires
pertaining to our behavioral model as well as participate in a focus group. The focus groups will be used to add
context to the quantitative feasibility data. Specifically, we will address acceptability, adoption, appropriateness,
sustainability, and the perceived socioecological determinants. Crucially, the outcomes from this proposal will
be instrumental in facilitating the design of a subsequent clinical trial to test a mechanism-informed yet feasible
SB reduction intervention, and in doing so directly support the development of SB policy."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is among the most common complications of pregnancy and it increases
the risk of perinatal complications and long-term sequelae for both the mother (subsequent diabetes) and the
exposed child (obesity). Up to 50% of patients with GDM require the addition of pharmacologic therapy during
pregnancy. However, the long-term effects of pharmacologic treatment of GDM on maternal and child
outcomes are unknown, making the optimal treatment unclear. We propose a longitudinal cohort study of more
than 44,000 Kaiser Permanente members (>79% from racial/ethnic minority groups) with time-varying
exposure to metformin, glyburide, and insulin during pregnancy. Pregnancies diagnosed with GDM requiring
pharmacologic treatment from 2008 to 2021 at Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California will be
included. We will follow pregnant individuals and their children through our comprehensive electronic health
record (EHR) for up to 18 years. We will take advantage of natural variation in clinical practice and changes
over time in prescribing practices for first line medical therapy. The study population will consist of all patients
diagnosed with GDM who - after diet therapy - initiated pharmacotherapy within either insulin, glyburide, or
metformin. We will use state-of-the-art causal and statistical methods that can emulate inferences from
conceptual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using observational data to inform the choice of pharmacologic
treatment in a large, diverse population of adults with GDM. This will be accomplished by conducting a series
of real-world data cohort studies based on retrospective EHR data with inclusion/exclusion criteria and start of
follow-up that mimic those of the RCTs emulated. More specifically, we plan to conduct analyses for pregnant
individuals diagnosed with GDM to compare the effects of static and dynamic treatment regimens with
glyburide, metformin, and insulin on maternal diabetes risk after pregnancy and child growth and obesity risk.
The static and dynamic treatment regimens will be specified to reflect current clinical practice and directly
inform decisions on, not only, what initial drug type and dose to choose, but also, if and how to intensify
treatment through increased drug dose or initiation of insulin when glycemia control is not reached with an oral
agent. The incidence of maternal diabetes (Aim 1) and child growth and obesity (Aim 2) outcomes will be
contrasted between any two static or dynamic regimens (e.g., sustained exposure to insulin versus exposure to
glyburide unless glycemic control is not reached, at which time insulin is initiated). This study will yield results
immediately applicable to clinical practice by providing head-to-head comparisons of pharmacologic GDM
treatment strategies (metformin, glyburide, insulin) using state-of-the-art analytic methodology"

Three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide a tremendous
opportunity to model brain development and disease. Over the last few years, we have developed many hPSC-based
protocols that now enable researchers to routinely generate > 50 distinct human cell types for modeling both Central
Nervous System and Peripheral Nervous System disorders in a dish. More recently, our lab and others have
translated those 2D approaches into 3D “guided” neural organoid protocols to generate specific regions of the
human brain. Further complexity can be achieved by combining individual organoids into multi-region assembloids,
or by spatially restricted patterning to induce distinct human brain regions within a single organoid. However,
currently available organoid and assembloid models have major limitations, including a poor representation of
several progenitor and neuronal cell populations such as outer radial glia (oRG) and several cortical interneuron
lineages. We posit that the missing or underrepresented cell types may depend on signals provided by non-neural
lineages (vascular and immune cells). In our preliminary work, we have developed an improved hPSC-based
cortical organoid model which dramatically enhances the generation of oRG, cortical-derived interneurons, and
cortical excitatory neurons with increased levels of maturity. This was achieved by treatment with leukemia inhibitor
factor (LIF) resulting in the activation of STAT3 and mTOR signaling pathways. Data from human fetal cortex
development identifies vascular pericytes are a major source of LIF. Remarkably, we demonstrate that integrating
hPSC-derived brain pericytes can substitute for LIF treatment in cortical organoids.
Here, in Aim 1 we will optimize and assess robustness of the LIF organoid protocol and the generation of oRG
across multiple human PSC lines. We will further assess whether oRG give rise to intermediate progenitors, cortical
interneurons and cortical excitatory neurons using a unique oRG-specific double reporter hPSC line and genetic
fate mapping tools. Finally, we will determine how changes in mTOR signaling impact oRG behavior and whether
phenotypes observed in models of Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) are linked to aberrant oRG function. In Aim 2, we will
build an organoid system that integrates key non-neural cell types. We will establish a modular platform that
combines cortical organoids with 3D spheroids (“microtissues”) comprised of vascular brain pericytes and/or
microglia. These novel microphysiological platform will be utilized to determine both LIF-dependent and LIF
independent effects on cortical development. Finally, we will assess whether such a more complex
microphysiological platform will enable improved modeling of the developmental defects related to mTOR signaling
and TSC."
10780106,"Adaptations & IMpacts – Understanding Teen Pregnancy Prevention Programs (AIM-UP)
Abstract:
Adolescent pregnancies remain an area of marked health disparities, with significantly higher
rates among Black and Latino/a populations, rural youth, and youth involved in systems. What
there has been significant effort put into the initial development and testing of evidence-based
teen pregnancy prevention programs (EBPs), little data exist to guide replication and adaptation
to local contexts or for diverse populations. Yet most programs require some type of
adaptation. The AIM-UP project combines mixed methods data from nine large-scale federal-
and state-funded replication projects with over 17,000 participants from diverse locations and
populations across the state of Indiana. The AIM-UP project seeks to advance our
understanding of adaptation in EBPs focused on four key areas: system involvement and
trauma, implementing in rural communities, diversity, equity, inclusion and justice, and the need
for virtual learning approaches. Using the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and
Modifications-Expanded (FRAME) as a guide, the specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to
describe the frequency, characteristics and type of adaptations made when implementing EBPs
with a focus on the above four key areas; (2) to quantitatively examine the effect of adaptations
in these four key areas on key EBP targets, including skills, knowledge, attitudes, intentions and
behaviors, using youth surveys; (3) to describe stakeholder's approaches for determining the
need for adaptations for trauma/system involvement, DEIJ, rural delivery and virtual delivery,
processes of adaptation, and assessment of adaptation impact; and (4) to create an adaptation
toolkit using a Delphi process involving expert and community stakeholders. The AIM-UP
Project team is a 10 year university-community collaboration, led by Dr. Mary Ott, and
supported by Dr. Devon Hensel and Health Care Education and Training, Inc. (HCET). The
team has the research and analytical experiences, collaborative history, project management
skills, and program implementation expertise necessary to execute the proposed study. The
AIM-UP Project will inform EBP adaptation and replication."
10781768,"Project Summary/Abstract
Synaptic plasticity, or the ability of neuronal connections to change over time, is essential to the brain’s ability
to store and process information. Enduring forms of plasticity such as long-term potentiation and depression
contribute to nervous system development, homeostatic tuning, and are thought to underlie learning and
memory. In addition, several forms of short-term plasticity modulate synaptic efficacy continuously on rapid
times scales ranging from milliseconds to minutes. Our understanding of how these rapid forms of plasticity
contribute to the function of the nervous system remains largely theoretical. Identifying the molecular
mechanisms for short-term plasticity will enable in vivo manipulations that can remedy this knowledge gap. We
recently linked two forms of short-term plasticity to Synaptotagmins (SYTs), a family of molecules that act as
crucial regulators of neuronal signaling by conferring Ca2+ sensitivity to the process of synaptic transmission.
The high-affinity Ca2+ sensor SYT7 is required for a prominent form of plasticity called facilitation. A closely-
related isoform, SYT3, mediates Ca2+-dependent recovery from depression. SYT3 and SYT7 appear to be
activated by different patterns of activity, and could thus mediate the majority of activity-dependent plasticity on
sub-second time scales. Revealing how these two SYT isoforms perform their functions will provide new
insights into the machinery that tightly regulates neurotransmitter release. In this proposal we will use genetic
manipulation of both SYTs to answer unsolved questions about the synaptic biophysics of short-term plasticity
and its impact on cognitive function. In Aim 1 we will use SYT3, SYT7, and double knockout mice to determine
the extent to which these two synaptotagmins determine the properties of short-term plasticity in the
cerebellum and hippocampus. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular interactions that support short-term
plasticity using biophysical modeling and activity-dependent synaptic ultrastructure. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
use behavioral screening of knockout mice to screen for cognitive deficits that result from altered STP. Our
work will help to define the molecular interactions that support the most common forms of short-term plasticity,
and lay the foundation to study the contribution of short-term plasticity deficits in neurological disorders."

Down syndrome (DS) predisposes individuals to a wide range of cognitive outcomes, with some individuals
acquiring more advanced cognitive skills and others demonstrating severe or profound levels of intellectual
disability (S/PID). The early origins of S/PID in individuals with DS are poorly understood, and individuals with
DS and S/PID are often underrepresented in the scientific literature. This project will address an important gap
in our knowledge and establish a novel account of variability in cognitive skill acquisition in DS with an emphasis
on understanding those children who demonstrate the most pronounced levels of early cognitive delay. We will
characterize early cognitive growth in young children with DS and examine the association between
severe/profound early cognitive delays and behavior, biomedical factors, and molecular biosignatures known to
be affected by DS, such as various inflammatory processes, elevated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation
biomarkers, dysregulation of the growth hormone (GH)-IGF1 axis, and dysregulated metabolism. To achieve
this goal, we will recruit 90 children with DS to be assessed at three data waves (Wave 1 = 12 months; Wave 2 =
24 months; Wave 3 = 36 months) and we will conduct comprehensive cognitive and broader developmental
evaluations. Blood samples will be collected concurrently with each visit and biomedical history information will
be obtained. We will then model latent growth trajectories along early cognitive and other developmental
domains and examine the association between growth profiles, biomedical history, molecular biosignatures, and
severe/profound degrees of early cognitive delay at Wave 3. This integrated approach to characterizing
heterogeneity in cognitive delays in DS can potentially transform the nature of treatments and interventions for
those individuals who are in need of the most intensive degree of lifelong community support."

Flaviviruses are vector-borne, positive-stranded RNA viruses that emerge unexpectedly and cause a spectrum
of potentially severe diseases including hepatitis, vascular shock syndrome, encephalitis, paralysis, and
congenital abnormalities. During the last 70 years, Dengue (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV)
epidemics have occurred globally, and flaviviruses infect over 400 million people annually. Despite extensive
research, there are currently no FDA approved antivirals available for any flavivirus infection. Vaccines exist for
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV); for
Dengue, Dengvaxia is for those previously infected, and Qdenga has received EU approval for all populations.
However, due to poor efficacy, low vaccination rates and sequence variability, cases due to flaviviruses still
remain high, justifying the need for antiviral development. Current antiviral drug development is focused on small
molecules and neutralizing antibodies, which require high doses or frequent re-dosing to obtain functional
outcomes; their efficacy has been challenged by virus sequence variations. Thus, it is crucial to address the
need for higher efficiency and broader spectrum antivirals. To address this need we are proposing a new
paradigm for antiviral development, a mRNA-encoded activatable RNase, Cas13, as a platform for flavivirus
treatment. Cas13 represents a programmable RNase that can directly target and degrade multiple viral RNAs.
Synthetic mRNA and lipid nanoparticles are being used to deliver the RNase, as it allows for transient, non-viral
delivery, with an improved safety profile over other gene therapy vectors. To date, our team was the first to
demonstrate efficacy of mRNA-encoded Cas13 in vivo against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in our recent
publication in Nature Biotechnology. We also have preliminary data demonstrating single-dose efficacy using
mRNA-encoded Cas13 with DENV-2 via systemic LNP-based delivery. Our long-term goal is to generate a suite
of mRNA-encoded Cas13 drugs against pathogenic flaviviruses. Our short-term goal is to demonstrate targeting
of multiple flaviviruses, including DENV, WNV, ZIKV, Powassan and YFV, further investigate the mechanism of
action of Cas13, and demonstrate in vivo efficacy against DENV 1-4 and WNV."

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy that occurs
primarily in children but can also occur in adults. Despite recent advances in treatments, 20-50% of
patients do show primary resistance or relapse after treatment and ultimately die from their disease,
highlighting the need to discover novel targeted therapeutic approaches. The detection of highly
prevalent NOTCH1 activating mutations in T-ALL, seen in ~60% of patients, led to the discovery of
NOTCH1 signaling inhibitors such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), that block a critical
proteolytical cleavage step required for NOTCH1 maturation and activation. GSIs are currently being
explored in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory cases, however, the responses observed as a single
agent treatment have been generally limited, such that the identification of novel targets and
combination therapies capable of delivering strong and synergistic antileukemic responses in patients
is one of the most urgent goals in the T-ALL field. Our lab has previously demonstrated the therapeutic
benefit of targeting metabolic routes in T-ALL. In this context, my preliminary results strongly
suggest that targeting the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM) has strong antileukemic
effects on its own, and significantly synergizes with GSI treatment in vivo. Still, the role of PKM in T-
ALL remains largely unknown. Notably, PKM has two different isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2, and we
have already generated conditional knockout leukemias for each specific isoform, as well as for both
of them concomitantly, which will allow us to exquisitely analyze the effects of pyruvate kinase in
leukemia progression and response to therapy in vivo. Thus, the aim of this project is to
mechanistically dissect the function of PKM in T-ALL by using a combination of gene expression,
metabolomic profiling, epigenetic profiling and experimental therapeutics in vivo, taking advantage of
our unique genetic tools. Our results will shed light on the mechanisms by which NOTCH1 controls
cancer cell metabolism and will reveal PKM as a putative novel target for the treatment of T-ALL."

The U.S. health care system is poorly equipped to deal with the growing number of persons living with
dementia (PLWD) in the U.S. and their complex medical and psychosocial needs. While memory
impairment is the cardinal feature of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), behavioral
and psychological symptoms (e.g., apathy, delusions, agitation) are common during all stages of illness
and cause significant caregiver distress. Despite limited high-quality evidence of efficacy for
pharmacological treatment, our work has shown that clinicians prescribe psychotropic medications to
community-dwelling PLWD at rates that far exceed use in the general older adult population.
Unfortunately, this includes a high burden of psychotropic and opioid (central nervous system [CNS]-
active) polypharmacy (i.e., overlapping use of ≥3 medications from among antidepressants,
antipsychotics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist
hypnotics, or opioids)— which is considered potentially inappropriate for older adults given serious
associated risks including fall-related injury, impaired cognition, and respiratory suppression or death
when involving opioids. Goal C-1 of the NIA’s Strategic Directions for Research highlights the need to
improve safe use of medications for older adults, while the NIA ADRD Milestone 8.A Summit noted “a
research and policy vacuum for interventions specifically aimed at improving life for persons with
ADRD.” Minimizing CNS polypharmacy is a critical opportunity to improve safe medication use for
PLWD, both through preventing new CNS polyRx and deprescribing—i.e., identifying and discontinuing
drugs [where] existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential benefits—among PLWD already
exposed. However, the design of interventions to reduce CNS polypharmacy cannot proceed without
understanding why clinicians decide to prescribe these medications. In this explanatory mixed methods
study, we will first characterize patient characteristics associated with incident and continued CNS
polyRx in a unique cohort of all community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries living with dementia in the
U.S., combining both traditional and managed Medicare. We will use these Medicare data to profile the
CNS prescribing of the clinicians that care for these PLWD, and then, through a national survey and
detailed follow-up qualitative interviews, we will characterize the prescribing decision-making process,
including the underlying knowledge, norms, facilitators, and barriers associated with prescribing intent.
Finally, with input from a multidisciplinary Expert Panel including a PLWD-caregiver dyad, we will
identify critical remaining knowledge gaps and possible intervention targets. With the new insights
gained, we will chart a way forward to address the critical but previously underrecognized challenge of
potentially inappropriate CNS polypharmacy among PLWD living in the community."
11129572,"A ratcheting pediatric prosthetic finger using advanced
 rapid manufacturing technology
ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed project is to develop and commercialize a purely mechanical, ratcheting pediatric
prosthetic finger – the Point Mini – which 1) has an industry leading strength to weight ratio, 2) can be operated
unilaterally (one-handed), 3) offers anatomical rotation and flexion around the patient’s metacarpophalangeal
(MCP) joint, and 4) can be custom-made for each patient using advanced metal 3D printing technology.
The care of pediatric patients with partial hand limb absence requires a highly individualized approach. Each
child and their family bring unique needs to the clinic including various levels of amputation, lifestyles, personal
experience, and other medical indicators. Prosthetists and occupational therapists work with each patient and
their family to provide a personalized medical solution using whatever components and technologies are
available. Very often, the bottleneck in this system is the availability of clinically sound prosthetic components
that can be readily sourced by the prosthetists to provide an optimal prosthetic limb system, especially for the
pediatric patient population.
The largest population of people with upper limb loss are those with partial hand limb absence. This population
outnumbers all other levels of people with upper limb loss by a factor of 10. Therefore, we can make a significant
clinical impact if a product serves this population effectively. However, current commercial products for pediatric
patients with partial hand limb absence do not satisfy all the needs of these patients; passive fingers are seen
as being fragile and difficult to use while powered fingers are not indicated for use with the pediatric population.
In this Fast Track effort, we propose to 1) internally verify the Point Mini through a battery of mechanical tests,
2) validate the user needs of the Point Mini for regulatory requirements by engaging pediatric subjects with partial
hand limb loss and 3) assess the utility of the Point Mini through a clinical take-home study with pediatric patients
who have partial hand limb loss.
The mission of Point Designs is to innovate devices and algorithms in the field of upper limb prosthetic design.
We develop products that provide prosthetists and patients with solutions to meet the unique needs of each
patient in this dynamic and challenging healthcare setting. The Point Mini will provide an effective and durable
solution for children with partial hand limb loss and ensure their ability to enjoy their childhood, family, and life to
the fullest."
10780281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regulatory DNA elements, including enhancers and promoters, encode multiple transcription factor binding sites
(TFBS) that quantitatively tune gene expression in a cell-type specific fashion. Understanding and engineering
regulatory DNA could unlock new therapeutic approaches — for example, to restore proper expression of a
disease gene.
Diseases of haploinsufficiency, such as Alagille Syndrome, are one example where such an approach could be
transformative. Alagille Syndrome involves haploinsufficiency of JAG1, where improper dosage in vascular
endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells leads to life-threatening complications including biliary atresia as well
as right-sided congenital heart defects. An ideal gene therapy solution for Alagille Syndrome would be to
engineer the promoter of JAG1 to turn up the production of the unaffected allele of the gene by 2-fold. Yet, our
knowledge of how to program regulatory DNA to control gene expression is incomplete, in large part because
we have lacked tools to accurately identify, edit, or characterize TFBS in regulatory elements in the genome.
Our team has now developed innovative tools to dramatically increase the throughput of characterizing both
endogenous and synthetic TFBS and their effects on gene expression in the context of Alagille
Syndrome — allowing us to design DNA edits, test their impact on gene expression with high-throughput
screens, and evaluate their ability to correct pathological patterns of gene expression. In Aim 1, we will build a
genome-wide nucleotide-resolution map of TFBS in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells from healthy and
Alagille hiPSCs in conditions of static, physiologic, and pathological flow. In Aim 2, we will apply new pooled
prime editing technologies to systematically mutate regulatory DNA sequences in the JAG1 promoter and identify
TFBS that can increase JAG1 gene expression. In Aim 3, we will use CRISPR to correct JAG1 expression in
hiPSCs from Alagille patients and characterize their effects on gene expression and cellular phenotypes.
Together, these studies will illuminate basic mechanisms of Alagille Syndrome, test whether restoration of JAG1
function in cells from Alagille patients is sufficient to correct disease-associated cellular phenotypes, and
demonstrate a new strategy to program gene expression in the human genome by combining nucleotide-
resolution computational modeling with high-throughput sequence editing of endogenous gene promoters. This
approach is generalizable and can be applied to other diseases where programming gene expression is
desirable, such as for other haploinsufficiencies."
10780661,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects 8 to 12 million people in the United States. Intermittent claudication
(exercise-induced leg pain and severe walking limitation) is a hallmark of PAD which severely limits exercise
capacity and deceases quality of life. Clinical studies demonstrate that the exercise pressor reflex (EPR), a
neural reflex originating in skeletal muscle which contributes to the regulation of cardiovascular function during
physical activity, is exaggerated in patients with PAD. Furthermore, the exaggerated EPR during exercise in
PAD patients is seen before the onset of claudication. We hypothesize that in PAD, exercise-induced activation
of muscle afferents (i.e. the EPR), which is initially below the threshold for pain , initiates an exaggerated
vasoconstriction and worsens the ischemia of the exercising PAD muscle, which may further activate muscle
afferents above the nociceptive threshold level and produce the familiar exertional pain symptoms of
claudication. In Aim 1, We will examine the time-course of EPR function including heart rate, blood pressure and
local muscle blood flow during static and dynamic exercise in a rat model of chronic PAD and in sham animals.
We will determine the potential correlation between EPR function, muscle ischemia and pain behavior scores in
both sham and PAD rats. Finally, we will determine if selective ablation of the EPR with the potent TRPV1
receptor agonist, resiniferatoxin (RTX), improves muscle perfusion during exercise and pain indices in PAD rats.
Assessment of RTX efficacy will be carried out using a novel tissue clearing method in a TRPV1-tdTomato
reporter mouse model. Furthermore, our pilot study found that neural inflammation indicated by macrophage
infiltration occurs in lumbar DRGs post PAD. In parallel, we observed upregulated protein expression of nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2, a transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to oxidative
stress/inflammation) in lumbar DRGs post PAD. We believe that the purpose of upregulated Nrf2 protein is to
counteract the influence of neural inflammation in DRG neurons post PAD. However, this self-limited
compensatory response by an intrinsic DRG system may not be potent enough in DRG neurons to antagonize
exogenous neural inflammation evoked by PAD. Therefore, in Aim 2, We hypothesize that selective upregulation
of muscle afferent Nrf2 via Keap1-Knock-out (KO) will mitigate enhanced muscle afferent neuronal excitability
and pain sensation in a mouse model of chronic PAD. We also hypothesize that local epidural delivery of
hydrogel-based drug system with encapsulation of Nrf2 activator (i.e., Curcumin) will mitigate the exaggerated
EPR and pain sensation in a rat model of chronic PAD. Finally, we propose to examine the potential influence
of Nrf2 signaling onto DRG ion channel function such as potassium channels in muscle afferent neurons in PAD.
To date, the underlying molecular/cellular mechanisms of the exaggerated EPR in chronic PAD has not been
examined in any chronic PAD animal model. The long-term goal of this application is to discover the neural
mechanisms operating in the exaggerated EPR and claudication and to provide a novel treatment for PAD."
10764943,"Initiatives to Maximize Student Development in Translational Medicine (IMSDTM)
 Summary Statement
Over the last 20 years many professional organizations have documented that an insufficient number of underrepresented
students are being trained in biomedical sciences, including those trained for research in translational medicine (TM)
despite the significant increase in job opportunities for well-trained TM scientists. Lack of exposure and training
opportunities for historically underrepresented populations (URPs) severely hampers their capacity to fill this national
need. The College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) at Colorado State University (CSU) proposes to
create a unique training opportunity for URM Pre-doctorates to earn a PhD or DVM/PhD in TM. CVMBS has a strong history
of T32 pre-doctoral training programs as well as T35 summer research experiences for DVM, DVM/MS, and DVM/PhD
students interested in TM, but has seen just a moderate increase in URPs entering graduate programs. We seek to enhance
our efforts in training and recruiting URPs by leveraging pre-existing training programs; as well as develop new pre-
doctorate programs specifically designed to provide URPs with a an inclusive, supportive and comprehensive training
environment for research, communication, and career development in TM. The proposed plan provides comprehensive
and flexible TM training to facilitate basic biomedical and clinical research. To achieve these goals, five objectives are
proposed: (1) Increase the number of PhD students from under-represented backgrounds with interest and aptitude for
TM research to enter a mentored training program. (2) Enhance existing programs by building a flexible and rigorous
research training program for students in basic and clinical research. (3) Encourage, support and enhance TM training and
collaboration through CSU’s new Translational Medicine Institute (4) Facilitate entry into the workforce by providing
training in team research, science communication and professional development experiences. (5) Build social and learning
networks to provide a supportive and inclusive environment, enabling timely completion of the PhD degree. These
frameworks will support our IMSDTM students through individualized counseling, mentoring and advising relationships at
multiple levels. Success will be determined by a comprehensive assessment by the CSU Institute for Research in the Social
Sciences. We will recruit historically underrepresented students to our IMSDTM training program from CSU’s NSF CO-WY
AMP program; Fort Lewis College, a non-Tribal College Native American serving institution; CSU-Pueblo, a Hispanic Serving
Institution with well-established undergraduate training program for Hispanic students; CVMBS undergraduates from
three Departments of Microbiology, Immunology, Pathology, Biomedical Sciences, Environmental Radiological Health
Sciences, and the Cellular & Molecular biology program. This comprehensive training approach will prepare IMSDTM
scholars to successfully complete their PhD degrees and enter careers in the multiple discipline areas found in translational
medicine The IMSDTM cohort will enhance the experience of all our students by increasing diversity of experiences,
thought and perspectives in our graduate programs."
10764947,"ABSTRACT
Despite the best scientific efforts, no new treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has been approved by the
FDA since 2003. However, this may not be due to the treatment under investigation but rather clinical
heterogeneity within the study sample, as a subset of participants may not have AD or experience little to no
decline in AD symptoms. Thus, to improve the likelihood of success, AD clinical trials must homogenize or
enrich their study sample with individuals who will experience more rapid decline and are biologically-
confirmed with AD. One enrichment solution is related to the degree of performance change a person
experiences due to repeated exposure of a screening assessment, known as a practice effect. Practice effects
can be used to inform prognosis, diagnosis and treatment response in AD. We have recently designed an
online video game, called SuperG, that uses finger coordination to assess individual practice effects without
supervision in less than 7 minutes. We intend to deploy our online video game into MindCrowd, an electronic
cohort of >100,000 participants worldwide designed with the infrastructure for remote, large-scale, and widely-
distributed research to discover and study early biomarkers of AD. The long-term goal of this project is to
merge the PI’s experience in learning and video game development with his interest in AD-focused research to
enhance his career in creating next-generation, ‘crowd-sourced’ screening procedures to enrich the AD clinical
trial enterprise. The overall objective of this application is to utilize the MindCrowd electronic cohort to
determine how learning capacity, assayed with SuperG, relates to changes in cognition and daily function over
time, while providing valuable mentorship for the PI in motor-cognitive interactions, electronic cohorts and
practice effects in the context of aging. Based on extensive published and pilot work from the mentorship team,
the central hypothesis is that practice effects on SuperG will predict one-year changes in cognition and daily
function among MindCrowd older adults. Since SuperG game play is easily collected online, the rationale for
this proposed research in a distributed electronic cohort offers an affordable and efficient means to enrich
clinical trials in AD. There are two independent aims within this proposal. First, we will determine the extent
that SuperG practice effects predict one-year cognitive change in older adults. Second, we will
determine the extent that SuperG practice effects predict one-year functional change in older adults. If
successful, this project will provide cognitive aging research with a novel online screening tool that has the
potential to enrich future Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia clinical trials. This project also
incorporates the PI’s career goals and training activities concerning: motor-cognitive interactions, electronic
cohorts, and practice effects, together providing for independence in the establishment of a “virtual” lab with
modern capabilities. Further, the ‘socially-distanced’ nature of this project is particularly relevant in the context
of COVID-19 and will allow for the safe inclusion of participants remotely."
10781018,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term objective is to understand the expression and function of monocyte/macrophage Fcγ receptors
with a goal of improving antibody-based therapies for diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We
and others have demonstrated that CD20 antibodies improve outcome of CLL patients receiving both
chemoimmunotherapy and recently treatment with a second generation BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib. Monocytes
/ macrophages play a critical role in antibody-mediated depletion of tumor cells, but they are in a suppressed
state within CLL. In particular, macrophages in CLL patients are unusually large in size and play a major role in
supporting the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. These macrophages have been called nurse-like cells
(NLCs). We have found that activating the intracellular receptor NOD2 in monocytes / NLCs substantially reduces
expression of negative regulators such as the inositol phosphatase SHIP1 and the inhibitory receptor CD31.
Conversely, we saw upregulation of the activating FcγRI and the associated γ-chain. This led to significant
increases in FcγR-mediated cytokine production, including those that activate NK cells. Along with such
cytokines, there was upregulation of NK cell activating surface ligands in monocytes / NLCs treated with NOD2
agonists. Indeed, co-culturing of treated monocytes with NK cells enhanced NK-cell maturation and cytotoxicity.
Collectively, these results suggest that NOD2 agonists may be an effective adjuvant for the treatment of CLL.
Importantly, the NOD2 agonist MTP-PE (mifamurtide/ MePACT) has been the subject of past and current clinical
trials for osteosarcoma and was approved by the European Medicine Association (EMA) in combination with
intensive chemotherapy for osteosarcoma as an immune adjuvant. Overall, mifamurtide has an acceptable
safety profile as well, justifying it as an alternative strategy for clinical development. Based on the above
observations, we hypothesize that NOD2 agonists will activate monocytes / NLCs and will also indirectly or
directly activate NK cells. To test the predictions of this hypothesis we propose the following three Aims: 1)
Interrogate the mechanisms of influence of NOD2 stimulation on monocytes / NLCs and functional outcomes; 2)
Examine the mechanisms of influence of NOD2 stimulation on NK cells, including contact-
dependent/independent requirements, NK-cell maturation and cytotoxic ability; and 3) Validate the central
hypothesis in vivo that NOD2 activation can lead to phenotypic and functional changes in monocytes / NLCs, as
well as in NK cells, leading to stronger antitumor activity. At the completion of these studies, we will have
established an entirely novel mechanism of activation of monocytes and NK cells in CLL, thus enhancing the
efficacy of monoclonal antibody-based therapies."
10932917,"Impacts of hurricanes and social buffering on biological aging in a free-ranging animal
model
Natural disasters are deeply damaging to human health and welfare. Such disasters have the
potential to accelerate the aging process, which is the primary risk factor for most diseases.
Identifying age-accelerating consequences of natural disasters and mitigating their impacts is
therefore critical. However, natural disasters do not affect all individuals equally - there is
abundant variation in individual health outcomes. Evidence suggests that social support is a
critical buffer against the consequences of adversity, including natural disasters. But precisely
how social support gets under the skin to mitigate disaster-linked declines in health and lifespan
remains elusive. Gaps in understanding are partly the result of ethical and logistical challenges to
the study of humans in disaster zones, including the availability of baseline data, and our ability
to quantify aging across more than a few domains (e.g., molecular markers in blood, physical
frailty). Humans are also very long-lived, impeding longitudinal study of accelerated aging within
individuals, and they tend to emigrate away from environmental catastrophes, biasing subject
pools toward certain members of affected populations. These difficulties can be overcome by
studying shorter-lived nonhuman primates, which share much of their biology and behavior with
humans, exposed to natural disasters.
The objective of this proposal is to leverage pilot data generated by a 1-year R56 (R56-
AG071023) in our long-term study of aging in the rhesus macaque population of Cayo Santiago
island, Puerto Rico, which was heavily impacted by Hurricanes Maria in 2017 and Fiona in 2022.
Our objective is to use this natural experimental model to quantify how natural disasters affect
biological age in multiple aging domains (molecular, physiological, physical), and to test if social
support buffers these effects.
We will quantify the effects of natural disasters on biological age and the pace of aging (Aim 1) in
three ways: (a) Using data, particularly post-mortem tissues, across individuals, we will test if
animals that experienced a hurricane exhibit older biological ages for their chronological age than
those who did not; (b) Using longitudinal data in the same living individuals we will test if their
pace at which they are aging is accelerated by a hurricane; (c) Comparing across Hurricanes
Maria and Fiona, we will quantify the cumulative age effects of natural disasters, predicting
individuals that lived through two disasters will appear biologically older for their chronological
age, and have a faster pace of aging, than individuals that only lived through one.
We will then quantify the extent to which social support buffers against the effects of natural
disasters on biological age (Aim 2), using data across aging domains. We predict that individuals
with greater social support will exhibit lower biological ages, and a slower pace of aging, in
response to a hurricane, and will be buffered from age effects accumulating over multiple
disasters.
Our study will provide unprecedented insights into fundamental questions about how natural
disasters affect the aging process, and how accelerated aging can be buffered by social
resources, in the most human-relevant animal model of health, disease, and aging – the rhesus
macaque."
10775050,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, 53 million people in the U.S. served as family caregivers, the partners, relatives, and friends who
provide assistance (i.e., physical, emotional) to patients with often life-threatening, incurable illnesses.
Caregivers are increasingly tasked with responsibilities once performed by medical professionals, and the
availability and health of supportive caregivers is more critical than ever. A growing number of caregivers
provide care to patients with advanced, life-limiting cancers, and are tasked with critical patient care
responsibilities, and play a significant role in healthcare communication and advanced care planning as
healthcare proxies. The burden of these responsibilities is great and is driven largely by existential distress,
which contributes to anxiety, depression, poor quality of life, and mental health challenges in bereavement.
Concurrently, caregiving is an opportunity to experience a profound sense of meaning and purpose; caregiving
allows for the realization of new strengths and capacities, healing of relationships, and refinement of life goals.
When existential distress is addressed, caregivers can experience an enhanced sense of well-being despite
their challenges. While many interventions have been developed to support cancer caregivers, none directly
target existential distress. Our group adapted Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP), a highly effective
intervention in decreasing existential distress and enhancing well-being among patients with advanced cancer,
for cancer caregivers. Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers (MCP-C) is a stakeholder-
informed, innovative, manualized intervention designed to assist caregivers to connect to meaning and
purpose in life, despite the challenges of caregiving. Results of our pilot randomized controlled demonstrated
MCP-C’s feasibility, acceptability, and superiority in improving meaning, benefit-finding, depression, and
spiritual wellbeing. In the proposed trial, we will more rigorously evaluate the efficacy of MCP-C through a
randomized controlled trial of 200 caregivers of patients with advanced (Stage III/IV solid tumor) cancer who
will receive 7 sessions of MCP-C or Supportive Psychotherapy for Caregivers (SP-C), the standard of
community-based caregiver care. Participants will undergo assessments of meaning and spiritual wellbeing
(primary outcomes), and anxiety, depression, benefit finding, caregiver burden, and social support (secondary
outcomes) at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-months follow-up. Bereavement outcomes including
pre- and post-loss grief, preparedness for loss, and regret will also be evaluated at each time point. We predict
MCP-C will result in greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes, and that sense of meaning in
life will mediate treatment effects. We also predict that MCP-C will result in better preparedness for loss and
improved pre- and post-loss grief and regret. Our results will enhance our capacity to powerfully target
existential distress in caregivers of patients with advance cancer and by extension, improve their capacity to
provide critical care to patients at end-of-life."
10778116,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer immunotherapy is the practice of harnessing the activity of the immune system to combat cancer.
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a type of cancer immunotherapy that unleashes the activity of cytotoxic T
cells by blocking the interaction of inhibitory receptors on T cells with ligands expressed on tumor cells. ICB
has been an effective treatment for many, resulting in durable, even curative anti-tumor immune responses.
However, in most cancer types, less than 50% of patients respond, spurring efforts to understand genetic and
molecular signatures associated with ICB response, as well as therapies that can be used in combination to
improve ICB efficacy. Retrospective studies have shown that mutations in the ARID1A gene are enriched
among patients that respond to ICB in pan-cancer and cancer type specific trials. ARID1A is a subunit of the
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which utilizes energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to move
nucleosomes along DNA. Genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex are frequently mutated in human
cancer, with ARID1A being the most frequently mutated subunit and the third most commonly mutated tumor
suppressor behind TP53 and CDKN2A. ARID1A mutation could thus serve as an important biomarker for
cancer immunotherapy, potentially affecting treatment of hundreds of thousands of cancer patients.
It is not known whether ARID1A mutation is causal or how ARID1A mutation sensitizes tumors to ICB
treatment. Indeed, ARID1A mutation is commonly found in microsatellite unstable (MSI) or tumor mutation
burden-high (TMB-high) tumors, which are themselves independent predictors of ICB responsiveness.
However, ARID1A mutation is beneficial independent of MSI and TMB status and additive for patients with MSI
or TMB-high tumors. It was found that Arid1a mutant tumors grow more slowly than isogenic wild-type lines in
murine models, with increased immune infiltration and T cell activation. Further, Arid1a mutant cancer cells
upregulate a subset of genes in the Type I Interferon response, including chemokines and antigen presentation
and processing genes. Mechanistically, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of ARID1A results in increased R
loops, as well as cytoplasmic accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids and ssDNA. This proposal will utilize genetic
deletion and small molecule inhibitors of ARID1A to determine 1) how ARID1A deficiency causes cytosolic
nucleic acid release, 2) the pathway by which inflammatory genes are activated in ARID1A deficient cells, 3)
the role of R loop driven inflammatory responses in ARID1A mutant anti-tumor immunity and ICB response.
This will be accomplished using ARID1A mutant human cancer cell lines and mouse models of Arid1a mutant
cancer. Finally, studies pioneering the in vivo use of small molecule inhibitors of ARID1A in combination with
ICB will be performed. These studies will reveal the molecular mechanism by which ARID1A mutant cancers
respond to ICB with the potential to improve patient selection for ICB and to augment ICB efficacy with ARID1A
inhibitors."
10931645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 2-8 million people in the United States struggle with primary muscle tension dysphonia (pMTD)—
a functional voice disorder that adversely impacts daily living, occupational productivity, and quality of life and
results in $2 billion in lost annual productivity costs due to absenteeism. Although pMTD leads to the same
emotional, social, financial, and occupational hardships as organic, structural, and neurological voice disorders,
its pathophysiology is poorly understood. These gaps make it difficult to understand what causes symptom com-
plaints of vocal fatigue, vocal tract discomfort, odynophonia, and difficulties projecting or speaking for prolonged
periods in patients pMTD—especially in the context of a lack of overt structural or neurological laryngeal abnor-
malities. Although muscle tension and hyperfunction in the laryngeal system is the most proposed mechanism
underlying symptoms, it is largely theoretical and based on anecdotal observations.
Recent studies from the PI’s lab using well-vetted and validated physiological metrics to quantify tension and
hyperfunction in the (para)laryngeal muscles found no group differences between patients with pMTD and
healthy controls. However, patients with pMTD consistently reported significantly higher vocal effort, vocal fa-
tigue, and vocal tract discomfort with voice use across these studies and self-reported significantly different
sensory experiences on measures of interoceptive awareness. These findings suggest altered sensations with
voice use in patients with pMTD may be an alternative mechanism underlying symptomology to simply muscle
tension or hyperfunctional motor output.
We test the central hypothesis that the somatosensory system plays a role in pMTD signs and symptoms across
two aims. In Aim 1, we compare laryngeal sensation to pMTD symptom severity in patients with pMTD and
controls using laryngeal aesthesiometer sensory testing. In Aim 2, we compare paralaryngeal and widespread
musculoskeletal sensation to pMTD symptom severity in patients with pMTD and controls using mechanical
pressure and dynamic temporal summation quantitative sensory testing (QST) assays.
Outcomes of this proposal will elucidate the role of localized and central sensory mechanisms in pMTD and will
lead to improved diagnostics and management for this debilitating voice disorder."

 Pediatric asthma in American Indian (AI) communities of the Northern Plains Region presents a serious
health disparity. While many previous works carried out in minority communities – but not in AI children- looked
at individual level of influences on pediatric asthma and made parents responsible for asthma control, our
study will bring together a more comprehensive and realistic framework. Our novel approach will move the
study from the collected data toward Tribal health policy change. The FIPA2 study is designed to leverage the
previously NIMHD-funded Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma study (U54MD008164) which successfully
enrolled 324 Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal (CRST) children (age 6-17 years) in 2013-2017. That study also had
a randomized educational clinical trial component (NCT 03302962) and we documented results of that work. In
the FIPA2 study, we will examine the complex interplay between social, environmental and immunological
response to viral respiratory infections an gap in knowledge that remains largely unknown. In this continued AI
community-focused pediatric asthma study, we will test the hypothesis that AI children with asthma have
alterations in immunological response to several viral respiratory infections as compared to those without
asthma. We will also investigate whether social and environmental factors (SEF) significantly contribute to this
disparity through stressed-induced modification of immune state. We will explore the role of viral respiratory
infections (RSV, rhinovirus C, and influenza A and B) and SEF on asthma severity, including frequency of
exacerbations, ER visits/hospitalizations, and use of asthma medications. Aim 1 will identify social and
environmental factors (SEF) that contribute to asthma susceptibility, severity and long-term respiratory health.
Participants will be enrolled at our Missouri Breaks Industries Research Inc. main office by working with
Reservation communities. To achieve enrollment goals, we will also enroll in Rapid City, SD, an urban setting
where AIs also located (12.4% of the city’s population). In Aim 2, we will examine the role of SEF on
immunological and clinical response to viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in AI children with and without
asthma. We will test our hypothesis that interactions with detailed survey measures of SEF with immunological
and clinical outcomes of VRIs, including seasonality of viral responses in participants with and without asthma
are the strongest and most significant predictors in our AI participants. Aim 3 will bring a comprehensive and
vivid community input to this study and will benefit from our local community advisory board (CAB) that
supports the study. We will rely on our own, experienced CBPR-based and bidirectional process evaluation.
We will create a feasible and community-driven asthma prevention framework that will be effective and can be
applied in other AI communities as well."

Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) affects 1.4 million people in the United States and is the second most prevalent type
of dementia in the country. LBD includes individuals who initially present with a cognitive-behavioral disorder
(dementia with Lewy bodies) and those who initially present with a movement disorder (Parkinson's disease
dementia). LBD is even more expensive than Alzheimer's disease, as dementia occurs at an earlier age of
disease onset. It progresses faster and leads to greater disability and caregiver burden. Currently, there are no
medications that the FDA has approved to treat LBD, and only a limited number of medications are being tested
in clinical trials, creating a significant gap in available treatments for patients and their families. The key pathology
in LBD is the aggregation of the presynaptic protein, αSyn, in neuronal cell bodies (Lewy bodies), neuronal
processes (Lewy neurites), and synapses affecting the neocortex, limbic structures, and peripheral autonomic
neurons. Immunotherapy is being explored as a promising treatment option for LBD, as antibodies can prevent
the accumulation or possibly inhibit the spreading of pathological aggregated αSyn that contribute to the disease.
Of particular interest to this hypothesis is that a prodromal state of LBD exists in the form of rapid eye movement
sleep behavior disorder (RBD), associated with brainstem and peripheral αSyn aggregates preceding LBD onset
by more than two decades, making it an ideal target for an immunogenic preventive vaccine. We developed a
universal platform technology in the last decade, especially for neurodegenerative disorders, and manufactured
two MultiTEP-based cGMP-grade vaccines targeting pathological Aβ and tau. One of these vaccines is currently
in a Phase 1 trial with early AD individuals, and another will be used for a Phase 1 trial with cognitively unimpaired
participants. More recently, using MultiTEP platform technology, we also developed four vaccines targeting
different regions of pathological αSyn and tested their immunogenicity and efficacy in an LBD mouse model. The
most immunogenic and preclinically effective vaccine, PV-1950R targeting three B-cell epitopes of pathological
αSyn simultaneously, has been selected to move forward for IND-enabling studies. Our preliminary results show
that this vaccine induces high titers of αSyn antibodies in the LBD mouse model and reduces total and proteinase
K resistant αSyn, neurodegeneration, and brain inflammation. Accordingly, in this proposal, we suggest
conducting pre-clinical IND-enabling studies and a pilot Phase 1 trial on this vaccine targeting three B cell
epitopes of pathological αSyn. Studies will include (i) manufacturing of engineering-run recombinant protein that
is, according to FDA guidance, sufficient for safety/toxicology studies; (ii) completing safety/toxicology studies in
the LBD mouse model; (iii) completing immunogenicity and overall safety studies in non-human primates; (iv)
manufacturing cGMP PV-1950R/A bulk drug substance and fill/finished drug product, (iv) submit and obtain IND,
and (v) conduct pilot Phase 1 clinical trial with healthy volunteers (phase 1a) and with patients with RBD (Phase
1b) who are at the risk of LBD."

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome prevalent in hospitalized patients (10-15% affected), especially among critically ill patients (>50% affected). AKI patients are 6.5-fold more likely to die in the hospital and at much higher risk for developing poor long-term outcomes including incident and progressive chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and death. Early and reliable risk assessment is the key to proactive intervention and prevention. 
With the ever-growing availability of electronic health records (EHR), machine learning has made substantial progress in modeling the complex data for disease risk prediction including AKI. However, the majority of existing prediction models are built on data from a predefined patient cohort, also known as a global prediction model, optimized for the supposedly “average” patient. This one-size-fits-all prediction model may not work for all patients, and is especially inadequate for heterogeneous diseases such as AKI that have multiple etiologies, variable pathogenesis, and diverse outcomes. Combining patients with different etiologies in training a prediction model may hide subgroups that are more tightly associated with the clinical outcome of interest and may conceal unique pathophysiological processes specific to certain subgroups.
In our previous work, we found that a global model can make completely wrong AKI risk predictions for patients in high-risk and heterogeneous subgroups. Personalized modeling is a promising alternative in which a prediction model is dynamically trained for each incoming patient by using retrospective data of an individualized cohort of similar patients. Our previous work demonstrated that personalized modeling can capture patient heterogeneity with an improved AKI risk prediction for various subpopulations, but we also identified critical challenges to address to ensure model reliability and robustness.
The overall goal of this project is to develop personalized transfer learning methods to achieve equitable AKI prediction across subpopulations in the hospital setting. Specifically, we propose to develop new machine learning techniques to address two challenges in personalized transfer learning: (1) what is the best way to construct individualized patient cohort? and (2) how to avoid negative knowledge transfer during learning? Methods developed in this project are broadly applicable to other diseases and study findings can advance personalized clinical decision support for improving patient outcome."

One in every five youth are living with obesity, placing them at increased risk for developing diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. Identifying risk factors contributing to obesity is extremely critical so that prevention
strategies can be taken early to mitigate the obesity risk. Maternal diabetes in pregnancy is a strong risk factor
for offspring obesity. Multimodal neuroimaging has the potential to reveal important mechanistic insights into
the link between prenatal exposure to maternal diabetes and offspring obesity, but most existing studies
possess major flaws including: 1) cross-sectional design evaluating later developmental periods,
introducing uncertainty around the influence of other perinatal exposures; 2) poor accounting for the effects of
maternal obesity; 3) low statistical power and overly homogeneous populations; and 4) use of a single
imaging modality, limiting our ability to understand the complexity and full scale of brain abnormality
associated with exposure to maternal diabetes.
 By integrating noninvasive structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with developmental
neuroscience techniques and targeting the critical period of development, the first 1000 days of life, we aim to
test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to maternal diabetes will be independently associated with
altered brain development during very early childhood, and that maternal obesity will further
exacerbate these effects. We further hypothesize that these brain alterations will contribute to a higher
risk of obesity early in life. To explore this hypothesis, the applicant, and her team plan to leverage
longitudinal brain and body weight and length data during the first ~1000 days of life from 8 existing cohorts
that participated in NIH-funded The Organization for Imaging Genomics in Infancy (ORIGINs) consortium, part
of the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-analysis (ENIGMA). We aim to examine effects of
maternal diabetes exposure either separately or together with maternal obesity on brain metrics at birth (Aim 1)
and brain developmental trajectories from birth to 2-3 years of age (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will discriminate
exposed vs. un-exposed offspring (Aim 3) with replication by using innovative machine learning algorithms and
identify multi-modal imaging markers that predict obesity by age 2-3.
 This will be the largest and most highly powered neuroimaging study to identify robust multi-modal brain
signatures of prenatal exposure to maternal diabetes, thereby enhancing our understanding of
etiologic/causal pathways of obesity development."
10776787,"Abstract: Many gut-infecting bacterial pathogens undergo growth expansion in the gut lumen as
part of the virulence, and as supported by their underlying metabolism. Commensal metabolism
in the gut provides an opportunity to impede these processes by depriving pathogens of growth-
promoting nutrients. Using the amino acid and carbohydrate-fermenting pathogen Clostridioides
difficile, we will evaluate how redox metabolism of target carbon sources by the pathogen and
commensals can enhance or limit its ability to colonize and infect the gut. Analyses will leverage
innovative approaches to track nutrient flow among pathogen, commensal, and host tissues.
Studies will further perturb host environments using carbon sources that are fermented by the
pathogen, protective commensals, or both, to assess their role in disease pathogenesis and
progression. Findings will inform small molecule and bacteriotherapeutic interventions in disease
prevention and treatment."

The long-term objective of the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) initiative is to efficiently translate advances in neuroscience into treatments for adults and children with neurological disorders through partnerships with government, academia, private foundations, and industry. Recent discoveries in basic neuroscience have directly led to major breakthroughs in the understanding of disease processes in neurological disorders, many of which impose an enormous burden on individuals, families, and communities. Yet there are several organizational and logistical challenges to testing these new therapies in multicenter clinical trials, including inefficiencies in regulatory and institutional approvals, barriers to recruitment and retention of diverse study participants, and a dearth of individuals trained to be the leaders of multicenter clinical research trials. A central goal of NeuroNEXT (NN) is to facilitate, from initial conception through final analysis, high-quality early phase clinical trials and biomarker multisite studies with clear go/no-go decisions by providing efficient methodological, organizational, statistical, and logistical support. NeuroNEXT will also serve as the vehicle for the conduct of early clinical trials of gene therapy for ultra-rare neurological disorders. If warranted by the nature of the studied population, such as rare diseases, adaptive phase 2-3 trials and platform trials will be used.  NeuroNEXT is comprised of 25 clinical sites, a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Aim 1 is to create a collaborative and accessible CCC and clinical research network with the DCC, to efficiently conduct high-quality Phase 2 clinical trials, biomarker studies, and gene therapy trials in rare and common adult and pediatric neurological disorders. Aim 2 is to expand the pool and diversity of experienced clinical Investigators and research staff who are prepared to be leaders of multicenter clinical research trials. Aim 3 is to form strategic collaborations with key stakeholders in clinical trials, including government organizations, academia, foundations, industry partners, and patient-centered groups to organize high-impact clinical trials through NN for neurological disorders. NeuroNEXT innovations will include establishing a trial network that requires the use of a single institutional review board, a master contract process for all network- funded studies, centralized pharmacy and laboratory testing, a single Data Safety Monitoring Board for safety review, broad sharing of Standard Operating Procedures and knowledge, state-of-the-art early development trial design approaches, and the use of the common data elements for data collection. Applicants who seek to use the network can be novice or experienced trialists, thereby greatly expanding the pool and diversity of experienced clinical investigators trained and prepared to lead multicenter trials. New protocols will be proactively sought through several new outreach approaches. Eleven studies involving partnerships with industry, foundations, academia, and the government were funded in the first 11 years NN. The CCC will expand on these prior achievements to further advance and accelerate therapeutic development for neurological disorders."
10776914,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a type of stroke that usually results from rupture of an
intracranial aneurysm. Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a clinical syndrome of a focal neurological deficit,
cognitive deficit, or both is the strongest predictor of poor outcomes after aSAH. One of the most feared
complications of aSAH, which occurs in approximately 30-50% of patients, mostly between days 4 and 10 after
the initial aneurysm rupture. Cerebral vasospasm is considered the key pathophysiology that causes DCI after
aSAH. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that bedside monitoring of cerebrovascular physiology can be
used to track and predict functional outcomes after aSAH, including the occurrence of DCI, as well as assess
the efficacy of medical and endovascular interventions. Various diagnostic tools have been applied to detect
patients with cerebral vasospasm after aSAH such as transcranial doppler, angiography or perfusion imaging.
However, many of these tools have significant limitations. If better means existed to identify which patients were
at highest risk of developing DCI, or those in very early stages of DCI, clinicians may be able to more effectively
intervene and manage this debilitating complication of SAH. Here, we propose to use a novel, noninvasive,
bedside optical instrument Pathlength Resolved Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (PR-DCS) to continuously
measure cerebral tissue hemodynamics in patients with aSAH. The PR-DCS instrument will provide an accurate,
depth-sensitive measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), overcoming systemic errors prevalent in
conventional optical instruments. Further, these CBF measurements enable bedside characterization of
cerebrovascular autoregulation, which hold the power/potential to predict complications in the recovery from
aSAH. Aim 1 deploys PR-DCS technology to measure cerebral physiology of patients hospitalized with aSAH.
We will use PR-DCS to monitor CBF and to estimate an index of cerebrovascular autoregulation throughout the
duration of acute hospitalization. Aim 2 uses PR-DCS as a clinical tool for real-time monitoring of CBF changes
during pharmaceutical and endovascular interventions aimed at treating DCI. These innovations directly
overcome the limitations of current clinical monitoring instruments that have prevented continuous beside
monitoring of brain ischemia in aSAH. Our project is highly translational because the knowledge gained around
the mechanisms of cerebrovascular autoregulation can be applied to individual patient care situations."
10774227,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. Despite
being classically considered a demyelinating disorder, it has been demonstrated that neuro-axonal injury occurs
early in the disease course and represents the pathologic substrate for permanent neurological disability in
people with MS (PwMS). In clinical practice, disease monitoring in PwMS is performed by clinical evaluation and
use of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, including new T2 lesions and/or presence of
T1 post-gadolinium (Gd) enhancing lesions. Notably, these conventional MRI measures assess for the presence
of inflammatory disease activity rather than neuro-axonal loss and are only modestly associated with clinical
measures of disability in MS, a phenomenon known as the “clinico-radiological paradox”. There is an unmet
need in MS for a biomarker that may identify PwMS with ongoing neuro-axonal damage prior to the
accrual of permanent clinical disability, in order to allow for timely intervention.
 Neurofilaments are neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins that are released following neuro-axonal
damage. Increased neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels have been found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) in several neurological disorders, including MS. In MS, there is evidence that serum NfL (sNfL) levels
correlate closely with CSF NfL levels, are associated with clinico-radiological measures of disease activity, are
modulated by disease modifying therapies (DMTs), and predict disability worsening and brain atrophy. However
these data are derived mainly from small, single-center studies, and the influence of factors including
demographics, disease subtype, and co-morbid conditions on sNfL levels in MS remains poorly characterized.
It is also remains unclear if sNfL levels may be used to monitor response to therapy, guide decision-making
regarding potency of immunotherapy, and predict long-term outcomes. While, given this emerging evidence,
there is great interest in sNfL for use as a prognostic and monitoring biomarker of neuro-axonal injury
in MS, further clinical validation is necessary in larger, demographically diverse, clinically
heterogeneous, multi-center cohorts. Furthermore, it is of utmost importance that validation is
performed utilizing a robust, scalable assay that may be rapidly implemented in the clinical realm.
 We plan to measure sNfL utilizing a novel automated immunoassay (Siemens Healthineers; performed
on an existing clinically available platform) in serum samples from two large multi-center studies: 1) MS PATHS
(Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions) is a network of 10 healthcare
institutions in the United States and Europe, merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting
standardized clinical/imaging data and biospecimens during routine medical visits. As of February 1st, 2019,
>15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS with biospecimens already available for >5,000
patients. 2) TREAT-MS (Traditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis) is an ongoing,
pragmatic, randomized controlled trial, designed to evaluate in treatment naïve MS patients whether an “early
aggressive” therapy approach, versus starting with a traditional, first-line therapy approach, influences the
longer-term risk of disability (at 48 months). TREAT-MS is prospectively recruiting 900 subjects across ~45 sites
in the US (83 enrolled as of February 1st, 2019) with anticipated enrollment of 700 subjects in the bio-banking
sub-study.
 We anticipate that large-scale clinical validation of sNfL in MS as a prognostic and monitoring
tool in this study will lead to submission to the FDA of a full qualification package and will lead to
availability of the first blood-based biomarker of MS."
10774228,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last decade the incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased, and these
infections have had a particularly deleterious effect on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by
eliciting disease flares and increasing risk of colectomy. It is known that IBD patients have a 10% lifetime risk
of getting CDI and experience significantly higher rates of recurrence compared to non-IBD patients.
Mechanistically, recurrent CDI is thought in part to be due to a loss of key commensal species that provide bile
transforming activities, which convert primary bile acids, that serve as pro-germination signals to C. difficile, to
secondary bile acids which have been shown to be inhibitory to germination and to the pathogenesis of the
organism. Additionally, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), a major treatment breakthrough for refractory
CDI, is believed to work in part by reconstituting bile salt hydrolase activity. What is not known is why patients
with IBD are at such an increased risk for recurrent CDI given that CDI studies notably lack IBD patients as this
patient population has proven challenging given many suffer from baseline diarrhea. There is an urgent need
to better risk stratify those with IBD-CDI by utilizing mechanistic risk factors in addition to traditional
epidemiologic exposures. By individualizing risk predictors, high risk patients will be identified more promptly
and offered appropriate treatments earlier, thus preventing severe complications of IBD, improving symptom
burden and quality of life. Our overall objective is to identify IBD patients at risk for recurrent CDI earlier in their
disease course and provide therapy with FMT to not only prevent recurrent CDI but also the downstream
consequences associated with CDI. Our central hypothesis is that (1) identification of clinical, microbial and
metabolic risk factors, specifically bile acid profiles, for CDI recurrence among patients with IBD who have
experienced their first episode of CDI will allow for earlier identification of high risk patients and (2) FMT
performed after an initial episode of CDI in patients with IBD will be safe and will effectively reconstitute bile
salt hydrolase activity. The rationale for the proposed research is that unlike non-IBD patients, many IBD
patients are at risk for bile acid malabsorption, either from ongoing bowel inflammation and diarrhea or prior
resections. Given that IBD-CDI patients are often excluded from trials, understanding the extent to which
alterations in bile acid composition explain the higher rates of CDI recurrence seen in this population is critical
to providing more targeted therapies. The recent expansion in microbiome research has now made it possible
to ascertain detailed gut bacterial profiles as well as their metabolites."
10774229,"Abstract
Vessels in the nidus of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) have abnormal wall structure and
are prone to rupture, causing life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage and long-term disability. Brain
AVM rupture is often unpredictable. There is no specific therapy for preventing it.
An abnormally high level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in bAVM
pathophysiology. Studies show that interruption of VEGF signaling prevents bAVM progression. Anti-
VEGF antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been used to block VEGF signaling in
many settings. However, both antibodies and TKIs cause adverse effects in patients. Since bAVMs
are chronic and active angiogenic lesions, long-term VEGF inhibition will be needed to inhibit bAVM
progression and stabilize AVM vessels. Antibodies and TKIs need repeated dosing, which is costly
and inconvenient. In addition, recent studies show that TKIs have no effect on mouse skin AVMs, and
genetic deletion of the angiogenic signal-transducing VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) prevents
excessive angiogenesis but does not fully revert AVM formation. These data suggest that blocking
VEGF angiogenic effect is insufficient to treat AVM in certain tissues. A better reagent is needed to
prevent bAVM development and rupture.
Soluble FMS-related tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1) containing extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 binds
VEGF with high affinity, and thus reduces VEGF signaling through its membrane-bound receptors.
More importantly, sFLT1 has a direct role in maintaining normal pericyte function. We have tested a
sFLT1 gene therapy strategy in our bAVM mouse models, and have shown that intravenous delivery
of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing sFLT1 reduces bAVM severity. However, ubiquitous
expression of sFLT1 caused some adverse effects. In this study, we hope to demonstrate that sFLT1
improves bAVM vessel-integrity by inhibiting VEGF signaling and improving adhesion of pericytes to
endothelial cells (Aim 1). We will also test whether targeted sFLT1 expression reduces bAVM severity
with minimal side effects using AAV vectors that infect neurons or endothelial cells specifically in
combination with neuron specific or brain endothelial specific promoter (Aim 2), and whether
reduction of microglia/macrophage infiltration enhances sFLT1 therapeutic effect (Aim 3). We will also
investigate mechanisms by which sFLT1 therapeutic effects occur in all aims. The overarching goal of
this project is to develop a safe and effective method to prevent bAVM hemorrhage."
10774244,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is traditionally attributed to developmentally regulated disruption
of pulmonary surfactant production. However, studies of term infants with lethal RDS have led to the discovery
of genetically regulated disruption of functional surfactant production. Rare or private, biallelic, pathogenic
variants in the ATP binding cassette transporter A3 gene (ABCA3) are the most common monogenic causes of
neonatal RDS in term infants and childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). ABCA3 transports phospholipids
across the lamellar body limiting membrane in alveolar type II cells and is required for packaging of functional
surfactant. Pathogenic ABCA3 variants encode (1) disruption of intracellular trafficking, (2) impairment of ATP-
ase mediated, phospholipid transport into the lamellar body, and may also (3) activate intracellular stress and
degradation pathways that disrupt lung function. Current treatments (surfactant replacement, steroids,
azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine) are non-specific and ineffective. Lung transplantation, with a 5 year
survival of ~50%, remains the only treatment for progressive respiratory failure in affected infants and children.
 Development of variant-specific therapies for patients with pathogenic variants in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), a member of the ABC transporter superfamily (ABCC7),
can provide a model for development of variant-specific therapies for ABCA3, although correctors will likely be
gene- and variant-specific.
 The premise of this proposal is to develop a scalable, functional genomics platform for mechanistic
characterization of ABCA3 variants and for compound screening and identification of small molecule correctors
in a human, pulmonary epithelial, physiologically-relevant cell line. Specifically, we will use clonally derived A549
cell lines that stably express individual ABCA3 pathogenic variants for (1) fluorescence-based, functional assays,
(2) characterization of variant-specific, pathogenic cellular degradation pathway activation, and (3) screening of
FDA-approved compounds for rescue of variant-encoded ABCA3 intracellular mistrafficking and pathogenic
degradation pathway activation to test hypothesis that variant-encoded ABCA3 mistrafficking and
pathogenic activation of cellular stress and degradation pathways can be mechanistically characterized
and can be corrected with FDA-approved small molecules.
 These studies will provide proof of principle for a scalable, functional, physiologically-relevant genomics
platform to discover variant-specific therapies for infants and children with ABCA3 deficiency. Additionally, this
genetically versatile system can be adapted and extended to discover targeted therapies for patients with other
monogenic diseases that disrupt surfactant function or pulmonary epithelial cell metabolism."

The purpose of this K01 proposal is twofold: 1) to identify early protein biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and cognitive decline; and 2) to provide Alison Fohner, PhD with the mentorship and resources to pursue an
independent research career using multi-omic and longitudinal data to improve prevention and treatment of
AD. Every year, 500,000 people are diagnosed with AD in the US. AD has no cure; and between 2002 and
2012, nearly every clinical trial for new therapeutics failed. Plasma proteins are easily measured in routine
care, and protein levels may reflect underlying pathology. New technology that rapidly assays thousands of
proteins in large samples promises to improve protein biomarker discovery, and could lead to new strategies
for early risk stratification and for novel therapeutics. This proposal leverages the extensive existing data from
the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), an NHLBI-funded prospective population-based cohort study of 5888
White and African American men and women recruited in the early 1990s. Available CHS data include plasma
protein level data on 1300 proteins, whole genome sequencing data, yearly cognitive assessments covering
different functional domains, diagnostic information on AD, and stored biospecimens. This proposal aims 1) to
identify plasma proteins associated with time-to-incident AD and with rate of cognitive decline; 2) to assess
genetic evidence for and against causal roles of high-signal proteins in AD and cognitive decline; and 3) to
estimate the association of plasma p-tau181 concentrations, a biomarker of AD pathology, with subsequent
clinical diagnosis of AD and cognitive decline. This proposed research will not only advance our understanding
of AD pathology, but may also identify important clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Dr. Fohner
is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Washington. With her
background in genomics and high-dimensional data analysis, Dr. Fohner is well-positioned to pursue the Aims
of this proposal. She has composed an experienced and collaborative mentorship team, and has developed an
innovative training plan that will help her achieve research independence. The research and training plans in
this proposal will prepare Dr. Fohner to successfully compete for future R01 funding by enabling her to build
research skills and domain expertise, to learn new analytical techniques, to forge productive collaborations,
and to generate preliminary data. In summary, with the support of this K01 award, Dr. Fohner can launch a
successful career developing strategies to predict, prevent, and treat AD."

This proposal describes a five-year mentored laboratory training experience designed to lead to an independent
academic research career dissecting the underlying biology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The applicant’s career
goal is to become a prominent scientist in the AD research field by leading an independently-funded research
group. The career development plan includes training designed to broaden the applicant’s scientific skillset,
including: (1) utilizing systems biology approaches to validate protein networks and network hub proteins
associated with AD, (2) employing cross-species analyses to validate components of an AD-associated network
and dissect its underlying biology, and (3) applying translation biology approaches to determine how these
protein networks contribute to AD pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets. This plan incorporates
additional training in leadership, mentorship, grant-writing, and ethics. During a period of mentored research
training, the applicant will engage in skills acquisition, didactic training, seminars, international conferences,
meetings with his mentor and mentorship committee, followed by a transition to independence. The
proposed research seeks to improve our understanding of the underpinnings and pathophysiology of AD by
investigating an AD-associated protein network. We have identified the human M4 protein network that is
significantly associated with AD symptoms and neuropathology. Based on network analyses, Plectin (Plec) was
identified as a potential network driver that best represents the behavior of the entire network. The overall project
goal is to validate and elucidate the role of M4 network by dissecting Plec function in the Drosophila model. My
cross-species approach will powerfully enhance our understanding of Plec and the M4 network, informing a
therapeutic rationale for further studies in mammalian preclinical AD models. This five-year project will take place
primarily at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), an institution with nationally recognized departments in both
genetics, neuroscience, and AD research, including well-established research efforts. The Department of
Neurology has an outstanding track record of training early stage investigators to become highly successful
translational researchers. The research environment provides the best intellectual environment and available
technology. The proposal provides a broad research experience in systems biology analysis of proteomic data,
cross-species validation of a translationally relevant protein network, and functional characterization of a
proposed network driver and AD therapeutic target. In addition, the proposed career development plan will
prepare this applicant to become an independent scientist and leader in the AD research field."

Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) are the most frequently occurring global illness producing significant
morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations. Children suffer higher frequencies of ARVI than
adults and often experience re-infections. Common chronic diseases of childhood, most notably asthma but
also allergies (atopy) and obesity, can predispose to increased severity of ARVI. The goal of Project 1 is to
understand the longitudinal airway and systemic, innate and adaptive, immune responses to ARVI in
vulnerable groups of children with asthma, atopy, and obesity compared to control children without these
comorbidities. Furthermore, we will link these responses to clinical outcomes including infection duration and
severity. Project 1 is highly synergistic with Project 2 and the Overall program by utilizing similar sample types,
timing of sample collection, and common clinical endpoints; it differs by studying a distinct population of at-risk
children and it includes disease specific assessments of allergic immune responses. Project 1 benefits from
the overall program’s shared multi-omics approaches through a Genomics Core for the sample processing and
generation of airway host transcriptome, proteome, DNA methylation, and viral quantity and expression data,
along with host genetics. Similarly, it shares the Adaptive Phenotyping Core for the generation of high
dimensional cytometry data to broadly characterize immune cell phenotypes and for detailed identification of
antigen-specific cells. The first aim will determine differences in longitudinal respiratory innate immune profiles
in children with and without asthma, atopy, and obesity in response to ARVI using multi-omic assessments of
airway samples. The second aim will determine differences in short-term and long-term adaptive cellular
responses including a detailed characterization of viral-specific and allergen-specific T cell populations. The
third aim will utilize single cell gene expression, TCR/BCR sequencing, and surface protein quantification
(TotalSeq) to provide cell specific granularity of both mucosal and systemic responses. This study will
determine networks of airway and systemic immune pathways that lead to adaptive and maladaptive
responses to ARVI in vulnerable children. Our research program will produce novel mechanistic insights into
the diversity and commonality of immune responses to ARVI and use cutting-edge methods to provide novel
insights for future studies of disease prevention and treatment."

Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) are the most frequently occurring global illness producing significant
morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations. Adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an
increased risk for infection and respiratory mucosal inflammation may contribute to autoimmune disease

RA response to ARVI to determine how this affects infection severity and autoimmune disease progression.
The project includes a detailed systems immunology assessment of acute and long-term airway and adaptive
systemic immune responses to naturally occurring ARVI. Project 2 will examine these responses in patients
with early RA and established RA on immunosuppression and compare these responses to matched healthy
controls. This project is synergistic with the overall program by utilizing similar sample types, timing of sample
collection, and common clinical endpoints but differs by studying a distinct host. The individual projects benefit
from the overall program's shared multi-omics approaches through a Genomics Core for the samples
processing and generation of airway host transcriptome, proteome, epithelial methylation, and viral quantity

generation of high dimensional cytometry data to broadly characterize immune cell phenotypes and for detailed
identification of antigen-specific cells. The first aim is to determine differences in respiratory innate immune
profiles in pre/early RA, established RA, and healthy controls in response to ARVI using a multi-omics
approach. The second aim will determine if there are differences in adaptive cellular responses including a
detailed characterization of viral-specific and autoantigen specific populations. The third aim will utilize
TotalSeq (scRNA-seq, TCR/BCR sequencing and surface protein quantification), to determine the relationship
between mucosal and systemic responses. This study will determine both how mucosal inflammation
contributes to autoimmune pathogenesis and the host response to ARVI. It will produce novel mechanistic
insights into the diversity and commonality of adult and RA immune response to acute respiratory viruses and
use cutting-edge methods to provide mechanistic insights."

Neuromodulation strategies can alter the neuronal activity patterns, and many recent studies
report on beneficial effects of neuromodulation on cognitive performance. The focus of the current
proposal is on characterizing the effects of the transcranial electric current stimulation (tACS), a
type of neuromodulation, on the phase amplitude coupling between neuronal oscillatory bands,
neurotransmission, and working memory in an experimental model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
tACS is non-invasive, well tolerated, easily implementable, and temporally adaptable over long
periods of time, making it well suited to application in slowly evolving diseases such as AD. Recent
evidence in both healthy elderly and AD patients suggests that tACS may improve working
memory. At the same time, however, these data indicate a great heterogeneity in tACS effects
across individuals, underscoring the importance of deepening our understanding of tACS effects
on the AD brain and identifying sensitive biomarkers of the brain's response to tACS. Using
advanced multi-modal and multi-scale imaging techniques in a transgenic rat model of AD, we
will characterize the effects of varying tACS frequency on the theta-gamma phase amplitude
coupling of the neuronal oscillations that are thought to underlie working memory and get
attenuated in the early stage of AD. We will inject the brains of TgAD rats with viruses carrying
voltage indicators that incorporate into the neuronal membrane to elucidate tACS effects on
excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons because excitation-to-inhibition disbalance gives rise to phase
amplitude coupling disturbances. Having established the tACS stimulation frequency that
achieves greatest normalization of neuronal activity patterns, we will undertake multimodal,
multiscale studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our tACS protocol, when combined with anti-
tau immunotherapy, on rescuing phase amplitude coupling and cognition in the TgAD rats vs.
their non-transgenic littermates. To this end, we will map the effects of tACS in these animals both
at the microscopic scale using two-photon fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiology and at
the mesoscopic scale using MRI-based assays of functional/structural connectivity,
neurotransmission and neurometabolism; as well as establish its effects on working memory
using behavioral testing. Finally, we will train machine learning models using these neuroimaging
data to predict whether a tACS intervention is likely to elicit memory benefits in the presence of
early AD-like pathology. Our work will lay the foundation for the use of tACS as an adjuvant
therapy in AD patients."
10756456,"In this re-submitted application, we seek to evaluate maternal biomarkers of oxidative stress in relation to
schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in offspring, their relationships with one another, and
with other environmental exposures during development. The proposal is based on the Finnish Prenatal
Studies of Schizophrenia (FiPS-S), and Autism (FiPS-A), the largest seroepidemiologic studies of prenatal
exposures in these disorders to date, and the first to utilize a national birth cohort. This nested case-control
study draws on the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC), which consists of virtually all pregnancies in Finland from
1987-2017; the total sample size is approximately 1 million. Maternal prenatal serum samples were obtained
and archived from each gravida, and the Finnish psychiatric registries contain validated diagnoses of SZ and
ASD on virtually all hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases in Finland. We have identified large samples of
SZ and ASD case and control offspring and demonstrated relationships between several prenatal biomarkers
and these disorders in this cohort. Although maternal oxidative stress causes abnormal fetal development, is
associated with developmental insults, and leads to brain and behavioral abnormalities concordant with SZ and
ASD, no previous study has ever examined relationships between this prenatal factor and psychiatric
diagnostic outcomes in offspring. We aim to address the role of maternal exposure to oxidative stress and
these disorders by assays of maternal serum specimens in pregnancies from large samples of case and
matched control offspring. We will test the hypothesis that maternal biomarkers of the antioxidant defense
system are negatively associated with SZ and ASD in offspring and a pro-oxidant biomarker is positively
associated with these outcomes. We will also evaluate whether correlations observed between these maternal
biomarkers in control offspring are disrupted in SZ and ASD offspring. Moreover, we shall assess whether sex
and perinatal complications modify relationships between maternal oxidative stress biomarkers and SZ/ASD.
For this purpose, maternal serum samples from SZ and ASD cases and matched controls will be analyzed for
biomarkers of oxidative stress. This research has the potential to result in a better understanding of prenatal
risk factors for SZ and ASD. Since oxidative stress is a common pathogenic mechanism that is caused by
several types of environmental insults which have been implicated in these disorders, the study offers the
potential for their prevention by reducing these exposures and may suggest new pathogenic mechanisms in
future translational studies. In summary, the proposed work builds on an existing national birth cohort, and is
anticipated to impact an emerging and potentially transformative area of research epidemiology and
clinical/basic neuroscience, leading to improvements in public health policy."

The central theme of this P01 is to investigate the role of proton/electron/carbon radiation dose
rate in normal tissue damage and tumor killing. Delivery of precise doses of radiation with
varying dose rates to experimental tumors and normal tissue in animal model systems is a
critical task of each project. This Core will provide the dosimetric infrastructure to ensure that
each participating institution and radiation modality (electron, proton, and carbon) will have
consistent and robust FLASH doses. The proposal includes a multi-disciplinary group with
radiation oncologists and biologists who will work very closely with physicists to ensure
procedural consistency for FLASH radiation. Reliable and consistent irradiations and
determination of dose and dose rate are the primary functions of the Core. The specific
aims to enhance capabilities towards this outcome are:
Specific Aim 1: Develop and maintain a dosimetry infrastructure for accurate
determination and calibration of absorbed physical dose, beam delivery sequence, dose
rate and dose-time structure across experimental systems.
Specific Aim 2: Develop animal specific treatment techniques and dosimetric support
systems.
Specific Aim 3: Develop interlock and irradiation logging systems for safe and
reproducible experiments across all projects."

Guided by my 16 years of experience and leadership in the NCI-sponsored clinical trial networks (NCI-CTNs),
this R50 Research Specialist award offers critical support that would allow me to fully engage in high-yield
activities across a spectrum of educational, leadership, and clinical trials-related research endeavors.
Fundamental to each proposed activity is a consistent focus on reducing health disparities by promoting
diversity in modern clinical trial development. I would continue to provide strong leadership in my roles as
member of the NCI-Cancer Prevention Steering Committee and Vice Chair of the NCI-Gastrointestinal Rectal-
Anal Task Force, inspiring the submission of novel concepts and rigorous, equitable review, enhancing the
diversity of the committee's membership panel, and patient diversity in our clinical trials. As Principal
Investigator (PI) for the race/ethnically diverse NCI-NCORP Phase III clinical trial S0820/PACES (Preventing
Adenomas of the Colon with Eflornithine and Sulindac), I am committed to completing all research activities
within the five-year period of this grant, yielding the highest quality data for meaningful interpretation of our
results. Given existing strong nationwide collaborations, this R50 grant will enable me to continue to engage in
novel minority recruitment strategies for NCI-network-based clinical trials as we build upon our prior
randomized trial evidence. I would leverage the protected time provided by this R50 grant to mentor a diverse
group of junior faculty and clinical fellows from various cancer-related disciplines at our institution (UC Irvine
Chao Family Comprehensive Center, UCI-CFCCC) on NCI-CTN research. Moreover, this R50 grant would
provide me the autonomy to advance into new leadership positions that become available over the next five
years locally (at UCI-CFCCC, where I currently serve as Vice Chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board) and
nationally (within SWOG and the various NCI Steering Committees). Lastly, given UCI's historic strengths in
early phase cancer prevention clinical trials, this grant creates an exciting opportunity for our Cancer Center to
re-engage with the NCI-Division of Cancer Prevention Clinical Trial Network (CP-CTNet). As Site PI, I propose
to lead UCI as a CP-CTNet Affiliate Organization, expanding the access of our catchment area's diverse
population to early phase cancer prevention clinical trials."
10932265,"When making a complex decision, we often consider multiple dimensions, such as costs and qualities, that vary
among choice options. Evaluating important attributes of a given option is critical for optimal choice behavior,
and poor decision-making can result from an inability to properly weigh attributes, as is commonly observed in
psychiatric disorders. These deficits are accompanied by alterations in the structure and function of the
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), an area critical for value-based decision-making. However, the underlying neural
mechanisms and how they are disrupted remain unclear, and this limits our ability to map decision-making
deficits to neural computation. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand how the brain uses
information to make optimal decisions, and our specific objective is to develop a comprehensive model of
information processing in OFC during multi-attribute choices. To do this, we will use a multi-modal approach to
evaluate different frameworks of decision formation. A neuroeconomics view posits that the values of different
attributes are combined to compute an overall, or integrated value, and comparisons are made in the space of
these option values. In contrast, other evidence suggests that direct competition between attributes, perhaps
mediated by visual attention, is an important part of the decision process. Arbitrating between these models is
critical to advancing theoretical frameworks that can link decision-making deficits to disordered neural
computations, but a key challenge is that the steps of decision formation occur rapidly and internally, making
them difficult to observe or otherwise measure. Here, we address this by combining a novel multi-attribute choice
task with large-scale neural recording and population analyses necessary to reveal within-trial dynamics of
otherwise covert decision-making processes. In Aim 1, we will assess how OFC codes individual attributes during
multi-attribute decisions, and how this relates to classically reported integrated value signals. Next, we will
assess how attention to attributes alters OFC coding, value computation, and subsequent decisions (Aim 2).
Finally, in Aim 3, we propose a novel computational model of multi-attribute decisions that can determine the
extent to which choices are driven by the relative values of attributes versus integrated options. Our model will
also reveal latent variables that evolve during decision formation, which we will map on to neural responses. In
doing so, we aim to localize specific choice processes to unique neural circuits, and also demonstrate the
biological relevance of the model and its conclusions. Together, these studies leverage our combined expertise
in non-human primate behavior, computational analysis, and modeling to define the neural underpinnings of
multi-attribute choice in OFC. If successful, our results will not only refine the theoretical frameworks that guide
decision neuroscience, but will also shed light on neural processes that underlie decision-making deficits
characteristic of human psychiatric disorders."

 Myelin degeneration and white matter loss that result from oligodendrocyte (OL) death are early events in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that lead to cognitive deficits and correlate with disease status. The loss of OLs,
accompanied by a reduction of myelin density, axonal loss, and astrogliosis, are major changes in white matter
that occur in the brains in both AD patients and animal models of AD. OLs are the most abundant glial cell type
in the brain but the least studied cell population in the context of neurodegeneration, despite their vital role in
myelin maintenance and neuronal support. Recent genome-wide association studies and large-scale single-
cell transcriptomics of AD patient brains emphasized the crucial role of OLs in the development of AD. The
underlying mechanisms of OL dysfunction and its contribution to the initiation and progression of AD remain
unknown. Our recent work reports, for the first time, that mature OLs in AD patients and AD mice exhibit
NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammatory injury, concomitant with demyelination and axonal
degeneration. Unbiased proteomic analysis further suggests that the hexokinase 1 (HK1)-dependent glycolysis
pathway is most suppressed in AD mouse white matter. Mature OLs rely heavily on glycolysis for energy
production, even in the presence of oxygen. HK is the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the first step of
glycolysis by the phosphorylation of glucose. OLs specifically express a brain HK isoform, HK1. HK1 localizes
to the mitochondrial outer membrane, and the dissociation of HK1 from mitochondria decreases its enzymatic
activity, which is sufficient to inhibit glycolysis and induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We found that HK1
immunodensity and enzyme activity significantly decreased in OLs in AD patients and AD mice. In mature OLs
in AD, the HK1 mitochondrial association is disrupted by overactivation of the mitochondrial fission protein
dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and Drp1 and HK1 synergistically elicit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and
the release of interleukin-1β, triggering inflammation. The mature OL-specific heterozygous knockout of Drp1
in AD mice restores HK1-dependent glycolysis, abolishes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, corrects myelin
loss, reduces neuroinflammation and axonal degeneration, and improves cognitive function in animals. These
findings support the scientific premise of the proposed project that glycolytic deficiency in OLs, driven by the
Drp1-HK1 molecular switch, induces OL metabolic dysregulation and inflammation and causes white matter
degeneration, AD pathology, and cognitive impairment. Successful completion of the proposed studies will
support the hypothesis that OL metabolic deficiency is a key pathological process that induces inflammation,
demyelination, white matter loss, and AD-associated neuropathology and cognitive deficits. These studies are
crucial to further reveal the role of the novel Drp1-HK1 OL pathway in AD and determine whether this
pathological pathway is a plausible treatment target for AD."

 Accumulating evidence implicate Cav1.2 voltage-gated Ca++ channels in regulating dendritic spine
morphology and thereby postsynaptic stability in neurons. Cav1.2 channels form signaling complexes in
postsynaptic dendrites and dendritic spines, and functionally interact with several synaptic proteins. We have
recently established that the activity of these Ca++ channels is crucial for the adequate migration, proliferation
and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that
Cav1.2 activity is associated with the expression of synaptic proteins in OPCs and is essential for the normal
interaction of OPCs with neurons. Thus, we hypothesize that Cav1.2 channels that function in synaptic
communication between neurons also mediate synaptic signaling between neurons and OPCs. In this research
plan, we will employ imaging and electrophysiological techniques to study how Cav1.2 channels modulate the
formation of synaptic connections between OPCs and neurons. We will determine whether increase Cav1.2
activity is sufficient to stimulate OPC synaptic connectivity and we will study how the activity of these channels
modulates the expression of genes associated with OPC development. Three specific Aims are proposed: in the
first Aim, we will employ the pseudopod subcellular fractionation system in combination with proteomics and
RNA-Seq to investigate how the activity of Cav1.2 channels affect the expression of genes associated with OPC
synaptic connections. Then, we will examine by electrophysiology and Ca++ imaging the synaptic connectivity of
cortical OPCs in which Cav1.2 channels and specific synaptic proteins will be knock-down. In the second Aim,
we will use a mouse model in which overactive Cav1.2 channels will be expressed in OPC at different postnatal
time-points. The development and synaptic connectivity of these OPCs will be studied by a combination of
techniques such as electrophysiology and RNA-Seq. Finally, we propose to use chemo-genetic technologies to
influence the electrical properties of OPCs and thus OPC synaptic communications during brain development.
Via Cre-mediated recombination we will express two G-protein-coupled receptors in OPCs, hM3Dq and hM4Di.
We will evaluate how plasma membrane hyperexcitability (hM3Dq) and hyperpolarization (hM4Di) modify the
establishment of synapses between OPCs and neurons and how these electrical changes affect the
development of OPCs in the postnatal as well as in the adult brain. Decoding how OPCs can integrate and
process synaptic input is of fundamental importance for understanding brain development and for improving
remyelination of damaged white matter. We hypothesize that Cav1.2 channels are central components of OPC-
neuronal synapses and are the principal ion channels mediating activity-dependent myelination."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major source of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality where the first-line
treatment, positive airway pressure, is often poorly tolerated. The development of effective alternative surgical
therapies has been hindered by a fundamental lack of insight into the anatomic and neurophysiologic
mechanisms responsible for airway patency. A substantial body of physiology literature documents that caudal
pharyngeal stretch via tracheal traction is an important stabilizing mechanism of the upper airway, but forty years
of surgical interventions for OSA have focused solely on destructive techniques or ventral displacement of
pharyngeal soft tissue structures. Our proposal will address this knowledge and therapy gap by elucidating the
distinct effects of caudal traction on upper airway patency in OSA patients. Our central hypothesis is the
therapeutic stabilizing power of caudal tracheal traction can be harnessed via ansa cervicalis stimulation (ACS)
of the sternothyroid muscle, which generates caudal traction on the pharynx by contracting the sternothyroid
muscle, replicating many of the well-documented effects of caudal traction on pharyngeal patency. This
hypothesis challenges the long-held concept that the genioglossus is the major pharyngeal dilator muscle
responsible for the maintenance of pharyngeal patency during sleep. It rests instead on strong evidence that
caudal pharyngeal traction, normally mediated by tracheal pull, increases pharyngeal patency during sleep
through several distinct mechanisms. In SA1, we will elucidate the physiologic effects of unilateral and bilateral
ACS on pharyngeal patency during drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) with and without hypoglossal nerve
stimulation (HNS), the current state-of-the-art neurostimulation therapy for the management of OSA (DISE, SA1).
In SA2, we will determine the impact of ACS on the maintenance of airway patency in NREM and REM sleep. In
both SAs, we will test the impact of anatomic constraints on stimulation responses. We hypothesize that ACS
stretches the pharynx caudally, stiffening the soft palate and lateral pharyngeal walls. We additionally
hypothesize that the combination of HNS and ACS creates synergistic effects through opposing forces that
further stabilize the pharynx against collapse. Our aims challenge the primacy of the genioglossus in the
maintenance of airway patency during sleep. This project outlines rigorous approaches for establishing
synergistic mechanisms between the genioglossus and sternothyroid muscles based on our proven ability to
activate these muscles independently. State-of-the-art physiologic methods will be deployed to probe the effects
of muscle stimulation, sleep state, and anatomy on pharyngeal patency. Our findings will (1) transform our
understanding of upper airway neuromuscular control during sleep, (2) establish relevant neuromotor targets for
neurostimulation, and will (3) identify potential physiologic and anatomic predictors of therapeutic success."

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world
and a major global health problem, leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lack of an
optimum therapy mandates better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of NASH, identification of
regulatory molecules and development of targeted therapeutic approaches. Studies, supported by previous
cycle of this renewal application, unraveled a novel role of the oncogene Astrocyte elevated gene-1/Metadherin
(AEG-1/MTDH) in promoting NASH. AEG-1 induces steatosis by inhibiting PPARα, hence fatty acid β-oxidation
(FAO), and promoting translation of fatty acid synthesizing enzymes thus augmenting de novo lipogenesis

in NASH and NASH-HCC. We established the therapeutic efficacy of a hepatocyte-targeted nanoparticle

pathogenesis of NASH by regulating the functions of adipocytes and hepatocytes. We recently documented
that AEG-1 plays a vital role in regulating macrophage activation and mice with deletion of AEG-1 in myeloid
cells (AEG-1∆MAC) are profoundly resistant to N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)-induced inflammatory HCC. Our
preliminary studies now document that AEG-1∆MAC mice are also resistant to HFD-induced NASH, and identify
that a novel post-translational modification, cysteine palmitoylation, is required for protein translation and NF-
κB activation functions of AEG-1. These observations allow us to hypothesize that macrophage AEG-1
promotes NASH by regulating adipocytes and hepatocytes, cysteine palmitoylation regulates AEG-1 functions
which contribute to NASH development, and targeted inhibition of AEG-1 in macrophages and hepatocytes
might be an effective therapeutic intervention for NASH. Experiments using relevant mouse models and human
cells will be performed to address these hypotheses. Our proposed studies will unravel a novel role of AEG-1
in macrophages and a novel post-translational modification regulating AEG-1 function. Multiple clinical trials
document efficacy of inhibiting expression of genes in the liver by RNA interference (RNAi) strategy in a variety
of diseases thereby establishing potential application of this strategy to manage NASH in the clinics. Our
proposed studies thus have important mechanistic and translational significance."

10760283,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Epigenetic gene repression by heterochromatin is necessary for multi-cellular organismal development
and genome stability. Mis-regulation of heterochromatin is a cause of multiple diseases through perturbed gene
expression patterns. The long-term goals of our research program are to determine at a molecular level how
noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in heterochromatin formation and function. Many ncRNAs act in the
nucleus to regulate gene expression through association with chromatin regulatory machinery. We and others
have shown that certain RNA-mediated heterochromatin pathways require intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions
between ncRNAs and nascent RNA that serve as the trigger to form heterochromatin. However, many systems
where RNA is implicated have unexplored molecular mechanisms of action. We will address three high-level
major outstanding questions in the field: 1) Which heterochromatin systems are controlled through RNA-RNA
interactions? 2) How is heterochromatin built around nascent RNA? 3) How are RNA binding proteins re-
purposed from mRNA processing functions to contribute to RNA-mediated heterochromatin formation? Our
research program focuses on multiple heterochromatin systems that incorporate different species of noncoding
RNAs. We study long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as HOTAIR and pericentromeric transcripts, which can
inhibit heterochromatic histone modifiers to control their activity. In addition, we have developed the first
biochemical system to study the human nuclear piRNA pathway, which uses base-pairing of the small piRNA to
target nascent transcripts of repeats that then are suppressed via heterochromatin. Finally, we address how
RBPs such as the N6-methyladenosine reader YTHDC1 can work with ncRNAs to promote gene repression.
We use biochemical, structural, cell biological, and genomic approaches to study these models of RNA-regulated
heterochromatin. Mechanistic insight into these pathways will provide a fuller understanding of how they work
normally and in disease, which will prove useful in targeting for pharmacological intervention.
Relevance to public health
Noncoding RNAs are produced from regions of the human genome originally thought to be ""junk"" DNA. Many
ncRNAs participate in epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation and mis-regulation can lead to diseases such
as cancer. ncRNAs are therefore clear candidates to provide a missing link to understanding the molecular
mechanisms of many human diseases for which there is a ""hidden heritability"" factor that has not yet been
identified."

the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic, translational, and clinical scientists are
Latino/Hispanic-American or African-American. Less than 2-5% of trial participants are Latino/Hispanic-

10761790,"Infection-associated blindness caused by herpesviruses is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States.
Frontline therapies include the use of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir which inhibit the viral thymidine
kinase to restrict viral DNA replication. However, emergence of drug resistance and lack of strong corneal
bioavailability have made it an urgent priority to develop alternative therapeutics. We have recently discovered
a new mechanism through which herpesviruses, exemplified by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1),
propagate in the corneal epithelium. We have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized host protein
cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) is essential to
HSV-1 replication. Our findings shift the current understanding that CREB3 is only a cellular homolog of HSV-1
VP16. We showed that it is an important pro-viral factor that can be exploited to generate novel therapeutics
against HSV infections. We for the first time showed that its modulation via a chemical chaperone 4-
phenylbutyrate sodium (Na-PBA), can alleviate, ER stress, reduce CREB3 expression and inhibit viral
replication. PBA is currently approved to treat urea cycle disorder. Our translational results are supported by
strong in vivo murine data that suggests antiviral efficacy and topical dosage safety of Na-PBA. Due to the high
sodium burden associated with Na-PBA administration, its unpalatability, and inability to penetrate sufficiently
through corneal epithelium upon topical administration, we have developed various sodium-free PBA
nanoformulations to overcome limitations associated with oral and topical delivery of Na-PBA. The purpose of
this R24 application is to generate preclinical data in two animal models that support an IND application for
repurposing PBA to treat ocular HSV infection. This will be achieved via 3 well thought, exhaustive specific
aims. In the first aim, we will evaluate dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and safety of orally and topically
delivered Na-PBA solution and various sodium-free PBA nanoformulations. Furthermore, we will also
determine oral and topical, and oral antiviral efficacy of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA nanoformulations in
murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection. The second aim will use the most effective oral and topical
formulation(s) and test their safety, PK, and efficacy in guinea pig and rabbit models of primary and reactivated
ocular HSV-1 infection. Finally aim 3, we will investigate the potential of Na-PBA and sodium-free PBA
formulations to synergize with existing antiviral therapies to determine their potential as an add-on modality to
the existing treatment. The latter is likely and significant since PBA is a rare drug that works via alleviating ER
stress and aiding the host cell’s response to viral infection, and thereby reducing the chance for emergence
of viral resistance. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team including scientists, clinicians, drug
development and translation experts who can help us navigate through requisite FDA guidelines. PBA has the
potential to become a safe and efficacious alternative to existing ocular antivirals very quickly."

10761720,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Staphylococcus aureus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that is increasingly acquiring
resistance to all available antibiotics. One promising area for antimicrobial development involves targeting
bacterial acquisition and utilization of nutrient metal. This strategy exploits the fact that all bacterial
pathogens require nutrient metal to colonize their hosts. In response to this requirement, vertebrates have
evolved powerful defense strategies that sequester nutrient metals from invading pathogens in a process
known as nutritional immunity. One of the most effective metal chelating factors of the immune system is
calprotectin, an abundant protein that sequesters nutrient manganese, iron, and zinc and defends against
microbial infection. In addition to its metal chelating properties, calprotectin is a potent pro-inflammatory
molecule. The individual importance of each of these activities to protection against infection has not been
parsed, and the contribution of calprotectin metal binding to its immunomodulatory properties is not known.
 Prevailing models suggest that nutritional immunity ensures that pathogens are uniformly metal starved
during vertebrate colonization. We have challenged this concept through the application of innovative
imaging technologies, revealing S. aureus is differentially metal starved within abscesses. This discovery
necessitates a reevaluation of the environment encountered by S. aureus during infection, particularly as it
pertains to nutrient metal levels. We have also discovered that the S. aureus response to metal restriction
includes the up-regulation of members of the newly described COG0523 family of zinc metallochaperones.
Our preliminary results reveal that these enzymes enable S. aureus to combat calprotectin-mediated zinc
depletion by delivering zinc to critical metalloproteins involved in genome maintenance.
 Based on these fundamental discoveries, we hypothesize that following colonization of the vertebrate
host, S. aureus encounters immune-mediated metal restriction through the delivery of calprotectin to the site
of infection. In response, S. aureus up-regulates the expression of systems to combat this nutrient limitation.
We envision that this microbial response is heterogeneous, and occurs in a manner dependent on the level
of metal restriction experienced at distinct sites of infection. Finally, we predict that an important aspect of
this response to nutrient limitation is the up-regulation of dedicated metallochaperones that deliver metal to
proteins involved in DNA repair and are required for survival upon exposure to the reactive oxygen burst of
the phagocyte. Experiments in this proposal will test this model by (i) defining the heterogeneous S. aureus
response to metal starvation, (ii) elucidating the mechanism by which calprotectin protects against infection,
and (iii) determining the subcellular fate of metal acquired by S. aureus during metal deprivation. This work
will provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the importance of nutritional immunity during
bacterial infection and reveal the corresponding S. aureus response to this host defense."
10762340,"Host mucosal surfaces are highly specialized and possess a complex array of innate and adaptive immunity.
They provide the first line of protection against infectious agents by initiating protective responses to potential
pathogens. Furthermore, the symbiotic relationship of the hundreds of microbial species with the host requires
a fine-tuned response at the mucosal surface that prevents overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens, but sparing
beneficial microbes. While small RNAs (sRNAs) have been regarded as a class of intracellular regulatory
elements, emerging studies in plant-pathogen and host-gut microbiome interactions uncover that hosts can
exploit sRNAs, such as transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs (termed “tsRNAs”), via encapsulation in
exosomes, as a new mode of bacterial gene modulation or defense mechanism. Yet, it remains to be
elucidated whether such sRNA-mediated inter-kingdom gene modulation or defense mechanism exist in the
context of host-oral microbiome interaction. To address this knowledge gap, the present R01 application will
focus on host-derived, exosome-borne, salivary tsRNAs, of which the biological functions have remained
largely elusive to date. Speficically, we recently demonstrated that human Normal Oral Keratinocyte-
Spontaneously Immortalized (NOKSI) cells released two exosome-borne tsRNAs, tsRNA-000794 and tsRNA-
020498, when challenged with Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a key oral commensal and opportunistic
periodontal pathogen. Importantly, these two tsRNAs can be readily detected from saliva in healthy human
subjects. Intriguingly, both tsRNAs exhibit highly selective, Fn-targeting antimicrobial activity—directly adding
synthetic mimics of these two tsRNAs, but not scramble RNA, to bacterial culture inhibits the growth of Fn, but
not that of Porphyromonas ginigivalis (Pg), a gram-negative periodontal pathogen or Streptococcus mitis (Sm),
a health-associated oral bacterium. In preliminary work, we further took a multi-facet approach to identify a
putative RNA-specific membrane transporter as well as candidate intracellular bacterial protein targets of Fn-
targeting tsRNAs. Building on our comprehensive preliminary data, the goal of this application is two-fold: (Part
I) achieve mechanistic understanding of the cross-kingdom trafficking of host-derived Fn-targeting tsRNAs and

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is effective for treatment of Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD). Clinical improvement with rTMS is believed to reflect engagement of a target mood-regulating circuit.
This innovative proposal aims to enhance target circuit engagement through stimulation at an
individual’s optimal resonant frequency (RF). Circuit connectivity is maintained by oscillations at one or more
RFs specific to that circuit for that individual. Personalizing stimulation frequency is an opportunity to optimize
rTMS effectiveness, but there has been no method to identify optimal RF for rTMS treatment in a patient-specific
way. We developed a novel TMS-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) “interrogation” method that identifies RFs
by examining the degree of resonance induced by stimulation frequencies from 5–18 Hz for a target circuit
originating in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Frequencies are then ranked based on resonance
properties (degree to which they increase connectivity in the target circuit) and the highest-ranked frequency is
identified. Our pilot data suggest that MDD treatment at maximum RF (rTMSRF-MAX) rapidly modifies connectivity
and leads to early symptom improvement, providing preliminary support for a RF-based personalized approach
to rTMS. This project will provide a mechanistic understanding and validation of the RF approach through three
aims and hypotheses: 1. Establish reliability of a method for RF determination in a DLPFC-based target
circuit. H1: An individual’s RF median values and rankings will be stable across repeated measurements; 2.
Demonstrate superior neurophysiologic engagement of the target circuit with rTMSRF-MAX stimulation.
H2: rTMSRF-MAX will be associated with greater increases in connectivity in a left DLPFC-based target circuit than
rTMS at the lowest ranked resonant frequency (rTMSRF-MIN); 3. Contrast the neuroanatomic distribution and
degree of target circuit engagement by rTMSRF-MAX and rTMSRF-MIN stimulation. H3: Whole-brain EEG source
localization will display a distinct distribution and degree of regional brain activation following rTMSRF-MAX and
rTMSRF-MIN, with rTMSRF-MAX better engaging circuits previously reported to be related to antidepressant
response. 80 MDD subjects will undergo TMS-EEG interrogation at a neuroanatomically-defined left DLPFC
region. We will measure the resonance profile across the 5-18 Hz frequency range on three occasions for each
individual to evaluate the temporal stability of RF measurement. Subjects then will undergo separate stimulation
sessions with rTMSRF-MAX and rTMSRF-MIN. We will compare the two frequency conditions with regard to the
degree of stimulation-induced changes in EEG connectivity in the target circuit. Finally, we will utilize EEG
source localization to determine the neuroanatomic distribution of the connectivity effects of rTMSRF-MAX vs.
rTMSRF-MIN, and compare the distribution to determine if rTMSRF-MAX better alters connectivity within previously
reported treatment-responsive circuits. Findings provide a foundation for a novel personalized rTMS approach
and inform design of a future clinical trial to test whether the rTMSRF method enhances treatment outcomes."

As evident in the ongoing “tripledemic” of severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2, Respiratory
Syncytial virus, and Influenza virus, as well as re-emergence of enterovirus D68, virus infection is an important
health threat and a huge economic burden. Multivalent RNA vaccination is an effective measure for counteracting
virus infections and cancerous threats. However, multivalent vaccines need to inject relatively larger doses of
RNA than monovalent vaccines, which can trigger a potent innate immune response in vivo, causing reduced
transgene expression and unwanted reactogenicity. We have recently found that high dose RNA vaccination can
be safely achieved in mice by delivering self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) with a family of muscle-localizing
cationic nanocarriers, LIONTM. In vivo delivery of repRNA by LION restricted the formulation to the muscle and
local lymph nodes without inducing unwanted systemic cytokine responses. Systemic blockade of type I IFN
signaling increased transgene expression and the subsequent antibody and T cell responses. Notably, we also
found that CD11b+ cells [mostly monocyte dendritic cells (DC)] expand over time after intramuscular injection of
repRNA/LION. However, the role of the muscle-infiltrating cells in immunogenicity is unknown. Consequently,
many questions remain about how repRNA/LION vaccines induce adaptive immune responses and how
transgene expression and adaptive immune responses are inhibited by the type I IFN system. So, Aim 1 looks
at skeletal muscle DC (SMDC) and characterizes their immunological function both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2
focuses on type I IFN signaling and seeks to identify how type I IFN signaling limits transgene expression and
adaptive immune responses to repRNA vaccines. Aim 3 spotlights the inflammatory responses to muscle
damage and their role in inducing adaptive immune responses to repRNA/LION vaccines. The proposed studies
will test the following hypotheses that (1) the muscle plays a critical role in eliciting the immune response to
intramuscular-based RNA vaccines, and (2) muscle-restricted activation of the immune system is a novel
strategy for RNA vaccines to achieve high efficacy with reduced reactogenicity."

Mosquito-borne pathogens, including malaria, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya continue to be a major public
health concern globally. As only older mosquitoes are infectious and represent a risk to human health, scientists
have sought to age-grade mosquitoes based on this understanding; however, no reliable, cost effective and
practical methods exist to age mosquitoes despite the tremendous epidemiological value of this approach. The
overall objective of this R01 is to establish a novel approach to age-grade mosquitoes Aedes aegypti in the field.
The approach we took is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to analyze the biomolecules
from mosquito water extract that are bound with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and then the SERS spectra are
used in modern machine learning models to age-grade the mosquitoes. Our central hypothesis is that AgNPs
interact with specific biomolecules enabling SERS to generate unique and predictable spectral information for
establishing modern machine learning models to determine the age of mosquitoes. Our prior work demonstrates
the feasibility of SERS and Artificial Neuron Networks (ANNs) to determine the age of both lab (error <1 day)
and field-collected (error < 2 days) mosquitoes Ae. aegypti. In the proposed work, we will establish robust lab
and field-deployable protocols to produce reliable and repeatable SERS data of mosquito water extract. Then,
we will manipulate the lab and field conditions to determine the impact of biotic (food and infection status) and
abiotic (temperature) to SERS characteristics. Robust and accurate machine learning model based on modern
ANNs and Domain Adoption (DA) strategies will be established and validated for age-grading mosquitoes in the
field. In addition, we will explore the Multi-task Learning (MTL) strategies to simultaneously determine the age
and infection status. Our long-term goal is to establish a rapid, cost-effective, and field-deployable system that
enables real-time analysis and data sharing to facilitate epidemiological studies, risk assessment, vector control
intervention monitoring and evaluation."

 The University of Florida College of Medicine has a long tradition and record of accomplishments in training
medical students for careers in academic medicine and research. This application is a resubmission of a
competitive renewal of a T35 Grant titled “Short-Term Training for Medical Students in Cardiovascular and
Pulmonary Research” that was first awarded to the College of Medicine in 1981 and is now in its 40th year. The
purpose of the training grant is to provide intensive, short-term (10-week) research experience for twenty first-
year medical students under the guidance of a chosen research mentor. The overarching goals of this proposal
are: 1) create a training program that equips trainees with the initial research skills, knowledge, and expertise to
engage in scientific exploration, 2) provide a roadmap for students to envision a future career pathway in
academic medicine, 3) monitor trainee-related experiences and outcomes that will serve as a foundation for
evaluating the status of the program and for making future improvements, and 4) instill a culture of professional
excellence based on enhancing rigor, reproducibility, and transparency in research.
 From among the 1,100 faculty members in the Colleges of Medicine and Engineering, 44 mentors have been
selected for inclusion in this training program based on the quality of their research program and proven track
record of training. A full-time, one-on-one research experience under the tutelage of a mentor is the core
component of the research training. This experience is augmented by a series of enrichment sessions that are
designed to provide fundamental research skills and present a series of potential roadmaps toward a career in
academic medicine. Topics that are covered include training in the responsible conduct of research, research
ethics, biostatistics, research oversight and regulation, preparation of presentations/abstracts/manuscripts, and
an academic career roundtable discussion. Student presentations, with comments from their peers and senior
faculty, are used to improve their skills and enhance their projects both at the onset and conclusion of the
program.
 Critical to the success of the training experience is the recent implementation of the Discovery Pathways
Program (DPP) with the medical school curriculum. The DPP is an experiential, small-group seminar series
designed to provide in-depth exposure to an area of particular interest. An essential aspect of the DPP is for
medical students to build a portfolio of accomplishment and scholarship. Spanning the entirety of the medical
school experience, students choose one of eleven tracks that cover a range of topics and interest areas. While
each track has a particular mix of seminar presentations, roundtable discussions, and engagement activities
outside the medical campus, common to all tracks is the requirement for a mentored capstone research project
suitable for publication in the peer-reviewed medical literature. The current training grant serves as the initial
launching point for this effort and the critical element that drives this unique and highly successful program."

Establishing a functional vascular network is a rate-limiting step in embryonic development, the repair of injured
tissues, and the engineering of tissue replacements. Although we have made progress in identifying factors that
promote endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting, we lack understanding of mechanisms that coordinately
regulate endothelial cell growth suppression and phenotypic specialization during vascular network formation,
which has created significant roadblocks for clinical therapies, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
We aim to circumvent these roadblocks by elucidating fundamental mechanisms of vessel network formation
and repair. Our previous studies, in the postnatal murine retinal vascularization model of sprouting angiogenesis,
revealed that shear stress of different magnitudes promotes differential growth responses and gene expression.
That is, arterial/arteriolar shear stress levels promote Notch signaling, and downstream p27-induced late G1
state, which enables TGF-b1-induced arterial gene expression (Fang 2017; Chavkin 2022). Conversely,
preliminary data show that flow magnitudes typical of veins/venules induce early G1, which we found enables
BMP4-induced upregulation of venous genes (Chavkin 2022). Our preliminary human stem cell studies are
consistent with these findings and show that vessel-specific shear stresses (venous vs. arterial) promote
differential growth responses (early vs. late G1 states), as well as venous vs. arterial gene expression. However,
blood flow is not required for the initiation of arterial-venous specification during embryonic vascular development
(Chong 2011), and whether endothelial cell cycle control is required for this process is unknown. Defining the
role of endothelial cell cycle regulation in embryonic vascular development could reveal a universal mechanism
required to establish arterial-venous networks. Furthermore, identifying novel key regulators of endothelial cell
cycle state and fate can provide new targets for the treatment of diseases associated with endothelial cell
hyperproliferation, including vascular malformations and tumor angiogenesis. Thus, our hypothesis is that
endothelial cell cycle control is required for embryonic arterial and venous specification, its
dysregulation promotes arterial-venous malformations, and manipulation of endothelial cell cycle state
can prevent or regress vascular malformations. We further hypothesize that mechanistic insights gained
from these in vivo studies can be used to optimize the specification of human stem cell-derived arterial
and venous endothelial cells. To ensure scientific rigor, we will test these hypotheses in vivo in models of
arterial-venous network formation and repair, and in vitro in human stem cell-derived endothelial cell culture
systems that allow genetic and flow manipulation to define mechanisms that regulate endothelial cell cycle state
and arterial-venous fate. Evaluation of these hypotheses will yield novel fundamental insights into blood vessel
formation that could improve vascular pathology treatments and human microvasculature engineering to sustain
a variety of tissues."

Detection and diagnosis of smaller and earlier-stage cancers significantly improves a patient's chances of
survival. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using fluorine 18–fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)
provides a functional or metabolic assessment of normal versus cancerous tissues, and since 2000 has been
widely used clinically for the detection and diagnosis of many cancers. Studies over a decade ago by our group
and others had shown that it was feasible to both measure and improve the detection ability of FDG-PET
imaging for cancer by adjusting acquisition and image reconstruction parameters. This could be done
systematically by evaluating the effect on observer models that replicated human performance (i.e. radiologists
or nuclear medicine physicians). At the time, however, it is challenging to understand how this varied across
systems with different resolutions, sensitivities, and reconstruction algorithms, or if they were operated
differently across imaging sites.
Over the last decade there have been dramatic improvements in scanner resolution, sensitivity, and
reconstruction algorithms, as well as the routine adoption of time-of-flight PET imaging. In parallel there has
been an improved understanding and adoption of model observers, as well as pathways for adoption or
harmonization of methods across multiple PET manufacturers and imaging sites. Most recently there has been
the development of machine intelligence algorithms, such deep neural networks, for both image reconstruction
and image analysis, which have the potential to improve performance.
We are proposing to take advantage of these developments to characterize, optimize, and harmonize cancer
detection with PET imaging. The three specific aims are: (1) Develop methods for characterization (i.e.
measurement) of detection performance for FDG PET imaging. (2) Using a model system calibrated to a
modern physical system we will then determine how to optimize cancer detection as a function of acquisition
and image reconstruction parameters. (3) Finally we will develop a platform-independent (vendor agnostic)
standard that can be applied across systems and imaging sites. This will lead to a roadmap for multi-site and
multi-vendor implementation approaches that optimizing cancer detectability and thus improved patient
outcomes."
10781958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Seasonal influenza virus vaccines have to be reformulated most years primarily due to immune escape caused
by mutations in the surface hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The genetic variation in HA only occasionally causes
change in antigenic phenotype and consequent immune escape. For extended periods of time strains with
genetic differences remain in a single antigenic cluster. In 2013 we (Koel et al.)1 found that the amino acid
substitutions responsible for antigenic cluster transitions in human A/H3N2 viruses occurred at only seven key
positions on the periphery of the HA receptor binding site (RBS), and that seven out of ten A/H3N2 cluster
transitions were caused by just single amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, major antigenic change in other
(sub)types of human influenza, as well as influenza viruses in other species, is also primarily due to single amino
acid substitutions at the same seven key HA sites, and nearby, on the periphery of the HA RBS. This discovery
raises an immediate, and not previously obvious question: If just one amino acid change is typically required to
escape immunity, why is the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses so slow? Human seasonal influenza A/H3N2
viruses remain in an antigenic cluster for an average of 3.1 years, and occasionally as long as eight years. This
is especially perplexing given that, as an RNA virus, influenza viruses have a fast rate of molecular evolution. A
possible explanation for the delay in fixation of cluster transition substitutions is that antigenic change incurs a
fitness cost. The proximity of escape mutations to the RBS offers a mechanism for this cost: the virus needs to
change close to the RBS as antibodies targeting the RBS need to be escaped, but change in this area also
affects receptor-binding function. Substitutions which advance a strain antigenically may only be competitive
when sufficient population immunity has built to contemporary circulating variants, such that the gain in fitness
from escaping immunity (the “extrinsic” fitness gain) outweighs the potential fitness loss associated with the
concomitant distortion of the receptor binding site (the “intrinsic” fitness loss). We refer to this as the “fitness
exchange” hypothesis. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of influenza requires understanding what paces
antigenic change. In this proposal we set out to test the fitness exchange hypothesis, to gain understanding of
the variation and impact of viral intrinsic fitness, and to determine the relative importance of intrinsic fitness and
stochastic effects in novel mutations becoming fixed in viral populations, and to integrate empirical
measurements of these effects into a probabilistic framework for predicting the antigenic evolution of seasonal
influenza viruses."

Transcription stability enforces cellular identity and is tightly controlled by restrictions imposed on
both transcription factor function and target gene accessibility. Progression of cancer to
metastasis and multi-drug resistance requires fluid transcriptional programs that can explore
different genomic landscapes to enable clonal diversification and the origination of aggressive
and treatment resistant phenotypes. In this application, we explore the recent discovery that an
increase in the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), induced by heavy
metal contaminants (such as arsenic, lead and cadmium) promotes histone H3.1 oxidation,
eviction from nucleosomes and replacement by the oxidation-resistant variant H3.3. Oxidation-
induced H3 variant replacement opens silenced portions of chromatin thereby licensing epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ER+/PR+ breast cancer cells leading to the origination of
aggressive, therapy-resistant and metastatic phenotypes. Protecting H3.1 from oxidation (using
pharmacologic compounds) seem to block metal-induced EMT thereby improving chemotherapy
outcomes of metal-transformed xenograft tumors treated in mice. The fact that suppressing
nuclear ROS opposes metal-induced EMT also suggests that there is a key pathway for
transformation downstream of the many targets of heavy metals in cells that can be explored for
therapeutic gain. We suggest that metal-induced H3.1 oxidation by mitochondrial ROS is a new
regulatory link between metal-induced changes to the cancer cell metabolism and chromatin
remodeling controlling gene expression programs that enable breast cancer progression and drug
resistance acquisition. Hence, we believe that developing pharmacologic solutions to target this
pathway in the short term may represent a significant step forward towards mitigating grave
consequences of environmental health injustice disproportionally affecting low income breast
cancer patients."

 Metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis (OP), osteopenia, osteomalacia and renal osteodystrophy
(ROD) affect more than 55 million Americans with an annual cost of more than $17B. The gold standard, dual
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measures bone mineral density (BMD). However, the majority of bone,
the organic matrix and water which together occupy ~60% of bone by volume, is inaccessible. A recent study
of over 14,613 participants found that ~80% of all non-vertebral fractures occurred among individuals with
BMD above the WHO definition of OP. Furthermore, the etiologies and treatments for OP/osteopenia (reduced
bone content) and osteomalacia/ROD (reduced mineralization) are different, but DEXA cannot differentiate
between these diseases. More comprehensive techniques are needed for the evaluation of cortical and
trabecular bone quantity/quality with information not only about mineral, but about organic matrix and water.
 Bone is “invisible” with clinical MRI sequences due to its short T2*. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequences
with minimal TEs of 8 µs make it possible to detect signal from bone. In the first four years of this award (1R01
AR068987, 09/2015 – 08/2019), we investigated 3D UTE Cones imaging of bound and pore water content as
well as T1, T2* and magnetization transfer (MT) ratio. However, those biomarkers showed only low to moderate
correlation with biomechanics, likely due to inaccurate measure of bound and pore water as well as incomplete
assessment of organic matrix and mineral in bone. UTE with a soft-hard composite pulse suppresses chemical
shift artifact, thus allowing more accurate measure of total water. Double adiabatic inversion recovery UTE
(DIR-UTE) provides more complete suppression of pore water, thus allowing more accurate measure of bound
water. UTE with MT (UTE-MT) modeling measures collagen proton fraction, exchange and relaxation. UTE
with quantitative susceptibility mapping (UTE-QSM) maps bone susceptibility, providing information about
BMD. Our goal is to develop a package for fast and accurate mapping of total, bound and pore water, collagen
proton fraction, exchange, relaxation, and mineral, and to apply it to OP, osteopenia and ROD patients. Aim 1
targets UTE techniques for fast and accurate mapping of water, collagen and mineral in femur (midshaft, head
and neck), using µCT, histomorphometry, Raman and gravimetry as reference standard. Aim 2 will evaluate
UTE techniques for water, collagen and mineral in femur from donors with OP (n=20), osteopenia (n=20) and
ROD (n=20), with UTE biomarkers correlated with µCT, histomorphometry, Raman and biomechanical testing.
Aim 3 targets translational UTE sequences to measure water, collagen and mineral in femur of young (<40y,
n=30) and older women (>70y) with (n=30) and without (n=30) OP, with osteopenia (n=30) and with ROD
(n=30). UTE biomarkers in different groups will be compared, and correlated with BMD, biochemical markers
and fracture history. This work will provide panels of 3D UTE biomarkers for more accurate assessment of
bone quantity and quality, and may have a major impact on the diagnosis of various metabolic bone diseases."

Extensive research has documented the link between exclusionary discipline and numerous detrimental youth
outcomes including lower academic achievement, a greater likelihood of being pushed out of school, and an
increase in substance use and future criminal justice involvement. To engage in upstream prevention to reduce
opioid and other substance misuse among youth there is a need to examine systems-wide, preventative
interventions in schools to reduce educators biased and punitive interactions with students while implementing
equitable supports. Thus, “Preventing School Exclusion and Opioid Misuse: Effectiveness of the Inclusive Skill-
building Learning Approach (ISLA)” is being submitted to the National Institutes of Health, through the HEAL
Initiative (RFA-DA-23-051). The proposed project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of ISLA, an instructional
and restorative alternative to exclusionary discipline, on improving the social determinants of health (SDOH) of
education access and quality, and social and community context to prevent school exclusion and opioid and
other substance misuse. We will conduct an effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Type 1 clustered randomized
controlled trial in 60 middle schools across six states. All students and educators randomized to treatment will
receive ISLA, and we will evaluate impacts of ISLA on student outcomes from the end of 6th to the end of 8th
grade. In addition, we will incorporate methods to understand intervention processes across multiple levels of
the school context. Our first aim is to examine the effectiveness of the ISLA. We will test the direct effects of
ISLA on the SDOH of education access and quality, specifically: (a) exclusionary discipline practices (office
discipline referrals, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions); (b) student engagement; and (c) inclusive
teaching practices. We will also test the direct effects of ISLA on the SDOH of social and community context,
specifically: (a) student-teacher relationships; and (b) school climate. Additionally, we will test the direct effects
of ISLA on opioid and other substance misuse and associated risk factors. Our second aim is to examine the
mediators and moderators of ISLA intervention effects which serve as key mechanisms for change in opioid
and other substance misuse and associated risk factors. We will examine the putative mediating effects of
ISLA social determinant mechanisms on opioid and other substance misuse and associated risk factors. We
will also examine the potential moderating effect between student race/ethnicity and the ISLA intervention on
reductions in exclusionary disciplinary practices. Finally, our third aim is to evaluate the implementation
outcomes of the ISLA intervention, including: (a) feasibility, usability, acceptability, and fidelity; (b) sustainment;
and (c) cost analysis. This project will fill a persistent gap in the field of substance use, by evaluating whether
upstream school-based preventative interventions that target and improve SDOH can have meaningful impacts
on preventing opioid and other substance misuse and associated risk factors."

In individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, epilepsy surgery can often reduce or eliminate seizures by
resection or ablation of regions responsible for seizure generation, or epileptogenic zones (EZs). Successful
epilepsy surgery depends critically on accurate and complete localization of these EZs. Current clinical strategies
for EZ localization include noninvasive presurgical evaluation, plus invasive intracranial monitoring with stereo-
SEEG (SEEG) in over 50% of cases. However, 33-50% of patients continue to suffer from disabling seizures
after surgery, as traditional presurgical testing does not consider the connectivity of presumed EZs to other brain
regions. We hypothesize that true EZs are network nodes with abnormal and identifiable connectivity patterns,
and brain network connectivity measurements may supplement standard clinical testing to guide EZ localization.
Here we propose innovative, multimodal studies incorporating structural and functional MRI connectivity
measures, resting-state and seizure (ictal) SEEG recordings, and electrically-stimulated cortico-cortical evoked
potentials (CCEPs) to help guide surgical decisions and localize “true” EZs using network connectivity. In Aim 1,
we will develop a novel supervised machine-learning approach using whole-brain MRI structural connectivity to
identify epilepsy subtypes and predict surgical outcomes. These measures may guide initial surgical decisions,
and help patients avoid intracranial monitoring when it is not necessary. In Aim 2, we will use a combination of
resting-state and ictal SEEG as well as CCEPs to define connectivity fingerprints of true EZs, which we
hypothesize will demonstrate increased inward (inhibitory) connectivity at rest but increased outward (excitatory)
connectivity at seizure onset (the Interictal Suppression Hypothesis). Using these measures, we will create a
combined SEEG connectivity model to supplement traditional ictal interpretation and improve EZ localization. In
Aim 3, we will relate SEEG and functional MRI connectivity measures to each other using penalized regression,
aligning brain states during both modalities using simultaneous scalp EEG. This will allow us to identify
noninvasive functional MRI network measures for EZ localization that are validated by SEEG in the same
patients. Our multimodal network approaches will use both electrophysiology and neuroimaging connectivity
measures, combining invasive and noninvasive techniques, to ultimately aid accurate EZ localization and guide
surgical decisions. Overall, our goal is to develop novel and innovative network measures that can be applied
broadly using existing hardware at surgical centers to improve patient care in drug-resistant focal epilepsy."

Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is characterized by optic neuropathy with progressive retinal ganglion cell
(RGC) death and optic nerve (ON) degeneration but in the absence of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. All
current glaucoma treatments are to lower IOP and are less effective in NTG patients. The primary reasons for
the therapeutic vacuum are the limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IOP-independent
glaucomatous degeneration and the lack of a practical and effective NTG animal model. Causal mutations in the
optineurin gene (OPTN) have been found in familial and sporadic NTG. Interestingly, OPTN mutations also
cause inherited forms of another CNS axonopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), indicating a common
degenerative machinery that can be activated by dysfunctional OPTN in vulnerable CNS neuronal populations.
However, although OPTN has been extensively studied and its various roles in autophagy, cytokine signaling,
and vesicle trafficking have been found, the pathophysiology role of OPTN in CNS neurodegeneration are far
from clear. We have recently established a highly efficient NTG mouse model by truncating OPTN gene in RGCs
specifically, which presents significant RGCs and ON degeneration within weeks. Using this novel NTG model,
we propose to investigate how OPTN mutation causes neurodegeneration in vivo through validating and
characterizing OPTN-interacting proteins in RGCs and ON. Through these studies, we will generate essential
information to uncover novel molecular mechanisms of glaucomatous neurodegeneration related with OPTN that
may be also shared by ALS and other CNS axonopathies, identify novel modifiers of RGC/ON
neurodegeneration, and provide valuable tools and animal models to develop neuroprotection therapies."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer related death in men in the United States in 2022.
A limit number of PCa cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models hinders research to improve
disease outcome. To address this unmet need, we have developed multiple PDX models, conditional
reprogramed cultures (CRCs) and organoids from patients with advanced disease. AKR1C3, also named
HSD17B5, is one of the most important genes involved in androgen metabolism and elevated expression of
this enzyme is associated with PCa progression and failure to androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs)
treatments. We have reported that upregulation of AKR1C3, concurrent with elevated testosterone and its
precursors in prostate cancer cells and xenograft tumors that are resistant to anti-androgen treatments. This
proposal will use blood AKR1C3 and plasma steroid levels as biomarkers to interrogate intracrine
steroidogenesis activation in ARPIs treated patients to signify drug resistance. We will also test a novel
AKR1C3 inhibitor in the newly established PDX and CRC models. The inhibitor has great potential to increase
efficacy of ARPIs treatments in advanced PCa which might translate into the clinical trial directly. The goal of
this program is to identify novel biomarkers and develop new pharmaceutical approaches to provide co-
targeting neoadjuvant with ARPIs to treat CRPC patients. Manipulation of key enzymes contributing to the
production of androgen potentially offers a novel targeted therapy for the advanced prostate cancer treatment,
which will have a meaningful impact on patients’ lives. The data acquired from this project will establish a
clinically relevant decision making for patient treatment and pave the way to future precision medicine in
prostate cancer."
10756440,"Gross chromosomal rearrangement (GCR) is a hallmark of cancer and DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs) constitute a major source of GCR. Many GCR events involve a
replicative process, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Based on the study in yeast,
a DSB repair pathway called break-induced replication (BIR) is believed to be a major
source of replicative GCR. Since the mechanistic study of BIR has been mostly carried out
in yeast, a model system to study BIR mechanism and its role in suppressing genome
instability in mammalian cells is highly in demand.
 We have established a novel EGFP-based BIR reporter, making it possible to
systematically study BIR mechanisms and analyze its genetic components in mammalian
cells. We hypothesize that BIR, on one hand, is involved in DSB repair to prevent
chromosome breakages and help maintenance of genome stability, but on the other hand,
is highly mutagenic and its dysregulation would contribute to genome instability. In this
proposal, we will study how BIR is induced by replication and oncogenic stress and
contributes to genome instability. We will also study the role and the underlying mechanism
of replication helicases such as Pif1 and other replication proteins in BIR. We will decipher
the role of ATR-mediated phosphorylation in promoting BIR and examine functional
interplay of replication proteins with Rad51 at collapsed forks to initiate BIR for replication
restart. Our study will shed light on how BIR is operated in mammalian cells and provide
new mechanistic insight on the maintenance of genome integrity. It will also open new
opportunities to explore the BIR pathway for cancer treatment."

Over 75,000 cases of pediatric severe sepsis occur in the US per year with mortality of 10-30%, and significant
risk of new disability in survivors. Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates 25% of pediatric severe sepsis, and is
associated with further increased risk of mortality and disability. Dr. Fitzgerald’s goals are to define biomarker
phenotypes and antibiotic exposures associated with septic AKI, to use these to improve pharmacologic
models predicting vancomycin disposition, and test a strategy of personalized vancomycin prescribing and
dose adjustments in a pilot trial with a goal of increased antibiotic efficacy and lower toxicity to the kidney.
These results will inform future large interventional studies to reduce pediatric septic AKI, with the goal of
allowing children with sepsis to lead longer, healthier lives free from disability, aligning with NIDDK’s mission.
Candidate: Dr. Julie Fitzgerald, Assistant Professor of Pediatric Critical Care at The University of
Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, is focusing
her research on patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric septic AKI. Dr. Fitzgerald’s immediate goals are
to prospectively study septic AKI risk factors; obtain research training in the application of pharmacometrics to
a specific pediatric critical illness and training in clinical trial implementation; and transition to research
independence. Her long-term goal is to improve health and quality of life for children with sepsis through
testing interventions to decrease sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Dr. Fitzgerald’s career development
plan includes coursework in pharmacology and clinical trial management; individualized expert mentoring;
training by expert consultants in the proposed methodology; and completion of the proposed specific aims.
Environment: The outstanding research infrastructure, educational resources, and expert mentorship at the
candidate’s institution will support successful completion of the proposal. A research coordinator team will
assist with subject recruitment and study procedures, and departmental statisticians will assist with analyses.
Research: The study objectives are to define risk factors and biomarker phenotypes associated with septic
AKI, and to use these to improve performance of pharmacologic models of vancomycin disposition. The
objectives will be reached through the following specific aims: 1) to define biomarker phenotypes and
vancomycin exposures associated with septic AKI, 2) to optimize vancomycin population pharmacokinetic
model performance and identify targeted dosing strategies in silico, and 3) to determine the feasibility of a trial
implementing personalized vancomycin pharmacokinetic models at the bedside. In a prospective cohort of
critically ill children with severe sepsis, urine biomarkers, vancomycin concentrations, and medication exposure
data will be collected and association with AKI measured. Optimal model-driven vancomycin dosing strategies
will be derived through computer modeling, and the feasibility of implementing personalized model-driven
vancomycin prescribing will be tested in a pilot interventional trial enrolling 20 children with severe sepsis."
10756516,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While we have established a tremendous amount of knowledge interrogating intrinsic leukocyte biology to inform
a breadth of immunotherapeutic approaches, more can be done to understand how cutaneous immune
responses are regulated and to translate that understanding into therapies that combat cutaneous immune
imbalance (autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, malignancies). The goal of this proposal is to elucidate
mechanisms of lymphatic transport that contribute to local inflammation and adaptive immune induction to
provide novel insight into how we may tune immune responses in vivo. Our published and preliminary work
establishes the dermal lymphatic vasculature as a necessary route for both immune activation (ON) and immune
resolution (OFF) signals. Further, we have demonstrated that dermal lymphatic vessels remodel their inter-
endothelial junctions (termed ‘zippering’) with functional consequences for pathogen dissemination and immune
induction. Whether these same mechanisms are activated across cutaneous immune phenotypes and how
changes in lymphatic transport directly impact immunity remains unknown. In this proposal we test the
hypothesis that dermal lymphatic vessels exhibit active, context-dependent functional remodeling to coordinate
cutaneous immune surveillance. This hypothesis will be tested along two aims: (1) we will evaluate the crosstalk
between lymphatic transport and the interstitial, inflammatory microenvironment in skin; (2) determine the
functional significance of lymphatic zippering in adaptive immune activation in draining lymph nodes. To
complete these aims, we couple genetic tools with robust immunological assays and high-resolution imaging to
resolve the systems-level interactions between skin and draining lymph nodes in vivo as a function of the
connecting lymphatic vasculature. We propose that lymphatic vessel transport is a poorly understood but active
determinant of cutaneous immune responses and that identification of specific molecular mechanisms that
regulate their function provides novel therapeutic opportunities to tune immunity up or down. Our work will not
only develop our physiological understanding of lymphatic transport and its contribution to immunity but further
suggest novel design principles for how to manage immunological reactions in skin. In this way our work may
help to inform clinical vaccine development and immunotherapy and may identify targets to maintain tolerance
during homeostasis and in response to therapy (e.g. immune checkpoint blockade)."

The intersection of genomics and infectious diseases has defined one of the most important leading edges in
contemporary science and one of the most critical areas of advancement in medicine, and as a result, has
provided a rich intellectual foundation for the training of postdoctoral scholars in infectious diseases. The
objectives of the grant are to train M.D. and Ph.D. post-doctoral fellows in the application of genomics to
infectious diseases, and to prepare them for successful, productive, independent careers that have a
significant impact on the health-related research needs of the nation. We propose to prepare all trainees
irrespective of whether they intend to conduct their research at the bench or from the bedside, in fundamentals
of both genomics and applied clinical investigation, with the goal of enhancing the translation of scientific
discoveries into clinical practice. We request support for five postdoctoral fellows each year - Ph.D. candidates
who have completed their thesis work and M.D. candidates who have completed their clinical training will be
evaluated by the Program's Steering Committee and offered admission on the basis of exceptional academic
record, faculty interviews, and interest in, and aptitude for research. Every effort will be made to attract minority
candidates. The training program will be interdisciplinary, involving faculty from Biology, Biochemistry,
Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Emergency Medicine, Genetics, Medicine, Microbiology &
Immunology, Pathology, and Pediatrics. All fellows will train for at least two years. Each trainee will be
encouraged to take courses in clinical research and in basic sciences related to genomics. Additionally, each
trainee will complete a two-year interdisciplinary core curriculum in applied genomics of infectious diseases.
Beginning in the first year, each fellow will embark on an in-depth research project supervised by one or more
of the Program's faculty; in many cases, joint-mentoring will involve faculty from different disciplines. In this
way, many research projects will be cross-disciplinary. Seminars by trainees and an annual research retreat
will promote interactions between program participants. While support from the Training grant will be for two
years, all fellows will be encouraged to begin to seek independent support after the first year. We will also
consider funding for a third year if needed for a trainee’s trajectory. The program intends to meet a recognized
need for clinician-scientists in Infectious Diseases who are trained in functional and applied genomics – a
recognized strength at Stanford University School of Medicine. This training grant has been, and continues to
be the primary source of postdoctoral research training support for clinician-scholars. Trainees are expected to
transition to independent positions in academia or industry, or positions in public health leadership and apply
their education in genomics to address pressing issues in infectious diseases."
10783017,"Millions of people are affected by sensorineural hearing loss caused by genetic mutations or 
environmental stimuli, and currently there is no curative treatment for sensorineural hearing loss. Transcription 
factor POU4F3 is essential for sensory hair cell differentiation, homeostasis and regeneration. During 
development, POU4F3 is required for ATOH1 to bind to enhancers of many hair cell genes to initiate their 
expression; after hearing onset, reduced transcription activity of POU4F3 due to mutations of one allele leads 
to hair cell death and hearing loss (DFNA15, autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss 15, in human 
patients); and overexpression of POU4F3 in supporting cells stimulates hair cell fate conversion. However, the 
transcription of the Pou4f3 gene is poorly understood and there is no feasible method to regulate Pou4f3 
expression from the endogenous allele to treat DFNA15 or to regenerate hair cells. In this project, we will 
characterize putative Pou4f3 enhancers to investigate the transcription regulatory mechanisms controlling 
Pou4f3 expression and utilize these putative enhancers to stimulate Pou4f3 expression in hair cells for a 
potential DFNA15 treatment or in supporting cells for a new strategy to regenerate hair cells. This work will 
further our understanding of the regulatory network governing hair cell specific gene expression, develop 
therapeutic treatments of DFNA15 and other forms of hearing loss associated with haploinsufficiency, and 
provide a new hair cell regeneration strategy with sufficient flexibility for a variety of factor combinations."

Evaluating Black and African American Breast Cancer Populations for Therapeutic
 Targeting of Aberrant p53, MDM2, MDMX, and PARP signaling
HC: Jill Bargonetti, PhD (Co-Leader)
TUFCCC: Denise Connolly, PhD (Co-Leader)
Partnerships are needed to break the systemic barriers that have limited systematic and ethical
biological research on the underpinnings of aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in
Black Americans of African Ancestry (AA). Our U54 partnership increases the ability to study
understudied biomarkers in order to improve screening and treatment options. This U54 pilot
project brings together teams of established scientists at Hunter College (HC) and Temple
University Fox Chase Cancer Center (TUFCCC) to analyze already available AA patient breast
cancer samples for screening highly probable aggressive breast cancer biomarkers that may
facilitate targeted treatments for AA TNBCs. Moreover, the team will mentor underrepresented
students from HC with cross-institutional exposure to different state of the art scientific platform
to Address Cancer Health Equity in training as well as research objectives. The primary goal of
this project is to determine if PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapeutics can be expanded,
beyond the mutant BRCA1 cohorts, to Black/AA cohorts with mtp53/MDM2/MDMX/PARP
biomarkers. We will educate the Black/AA community about breast cancer biomarkers and will
empower them to ask biomarker-based questions during diagnosis and treatment. The aims are
the following. 1) To compare the expression of MDM2, MDMX, mtp53 and PARP in breast cancer
(BC) tumors from AA and EA patients. We will construct (BC) tissue microarrays (TMAs) from
retrospectively collected tumors from 125 AA and 125 EA patients. TMAs will be stained for
MDM2, MDMX, p53 and PARP. 2) We will test the driver roles of the MDM2/MDMX-mtp53-PARP
for targeting BCs with PARPi therapies in cell culture and xenograft mouse models. We will work
with the Community Outreach Core to educate community about breast cancer biomarkers
Break Systemic Barriers to Inclusion: This study directly addresses systemic barriers of AA
women as an understudied cohort for biological determinants of TNBC. We are collating TUFCCC
BC AA samples, with the goal of identifying potential targeted therapeutic options to reduce breast
cancer disparities. Completion of this work will provide insights on critical breast cancer
biomarkers mtp53/MDM2/MDMX/PARP in Black/AAs and will educate the next generation of
under-represented scientists."
10762467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The lifetime risk and population burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias is high. Many dementias
have a poorly characterized risk contribution from environmental factors. In longitudinal epidemiology studies,
lead (Pb) exposure is linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite public health efforts, Pb
exposure remains widespread worldwide, with substantial exposure disparities. Early life is a particularly
vulnerable exposure period. Using an established mouse model of perinatal Pb exposure, data from our
research team suggests effects of Pb exposure persist into adulthood through epigenetic mechanisms, though
epigenetic effects within brain regions over time have not been mapped. Brain region-specific analyses of
genome-wide measures across multiple levels of the epigenome by perinatal Pb are critically needed. In
addition, using single cell RNA-sequencing, our preliminary data demonstrate brain cell types have variable
susceptibility to perinatal Pb exposure, specifically glial cells. Cell type-specific analyses of Pb exposure across
time and brain region will establish cells particularly vulnerable to Pb exposure. We also showed Pb gene
targets in the mouse overlap with key human dementia pathways. Further translation of toxicology to
epidemiology findings is essential to maximize the advantages of both study designs. Together, our preliminary
data support brain region and cell type specific alterations in epigenetic reprogramming and gene expression
as likely targets of Pb exposure in the brain, which act on human relevant pathways, and highlight our team’s
productivity and expertise in this area. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the sex-specific
impacts of perinatal Pb exposure on brain composition and human dementia development. In a longitudinal
study of mice perinatally exposed to Pb or control diet, we will test for Pb brain differences at multiple time
points up to 18-months. We will 1) test how the effects of perinatal Pb exposure persist into adulthood by
assaying pathological changes, behavior, RNA expression, DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, and
chromatin conformation across three brain regions at three time points. We will 2) determine cell types in the
brain most susceptible to the effects of Pb, using pathology and state-of-the-art ultrahigh resolution single cell
spatial transcriptomics. We will 3) relate the molecular effects in mice from perinatal Pb exposure to existing
data on human neurodegenerative disorders. This will be the first brain cell type specific map across multiple
levels of the epigenome in response to a toxicant exposure. Using Pb as a model toxicant to identify molecular
effects of perinatal exposure on brain regions and brain cell types, we will discover mechanistic insights into
how environmental exposures drive dementia incidence with important toxicology, developmental biology, and
public health implications."
10762427,"Project Summary
Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective in saving AIDS patients' lives, the implementation of ART
worldwide has been drastically hampered by the lack of treatment monitoring diagnostics and disease
management. According to the recent statistics by USAIDS, the coverage of ART is still only 59%, despite
ART being affordable or freely available in most countries. In addition, worldwide, about 1 in 4 of the people
that contracted the virus are unaware of their HIV status. One of the fundamental challenges to reduce HIV
burden and its prevalence is the absence of HIV self-testing assays which are sensitive enough to detect
new HIV infections during the first two-weeks (acute phase) post-infection and viral rebound in virally
supressed patients receiving ART. Current self-testing technologies only detect the host antibody response
to HIV infection, which usually arises 3-4 weeks after the initial infection and it is not an indicator of therapy
failure and viral rebound. No self-testing technologies have yet been commercialized that are able to detect
HIV during the early stages of acute infection or viral rebound in suppressed patients on ART. To increase
access to HIV testing and to improve treatment outcomes, there is an urgent need to develop reliable and
affordable HIV self-testing technologies. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a disposable
self-testing HIV-1 chip that can (i) selectively detect HIV from whole blood samples, (ii) be highly sensitive
to detect HIV during the acute infection, treatment and viral rebound (<1000 copies/ml), (iii) be rapid (within
40 minutes), (iv) be highly stable (refrigeration-free), and (v) be fully automated (true sample-in-answer-
out)."

 In this renewal application we describe recent progress in our ongoing studies of DNA-protein interactions,
which have focused largely during the last grant cycle on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in
the assembly, function and control of the macromolecular complexes that direct DNA replication in bacteriophage
T4, and outline our plans for the next five years. For many years Peter von Hippel served as the sole PI of this
grant, but now this program is a tightly knit joint collaboration between the research groups of Professors Andrew
Marcus and Peter von Hippel at the University of Oregon, who serve jointly as co-PIs of this research project. In
earlier work supported by this grant, the von Hippel lab focused on solution studies of the replication complex of
bacteriophage T4 and the transcription complex of E. coli. We note that these systems involve essentially the
same molecular mechanisms for `driving' and regulating these central life processes as do those of `higher
organisms,' including humans. These studies thus provide good model systems to examine how human DNA
replication proceeds at the functional level, and can help provide insights into what might go wrong in various
genetic diseases, which are often caused by minor quantitative changes in the properties of the `macromolecular
machines' of genome expression.
 During the previous reporting period we completed a number of studies on the above mechanistic
questions, using reconstituted DNA replication assemblies that carry out their functions in vitro with essentially
the same rates, fidelities and processivities as do the in vivo versions of these complexes. We proceeded by
placing fluorescent base analogue probes, or cyanine dyes, at defined positions within the DNA frameworks of
the reconstituted complexes, and then used fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor
biologically relevant conformational changes at and near the probe labeling sites. In this way, we obtained
significant information about replication mechanisms under steady-state or equilibrium conditions, and then
carried forward this work by demonstrating that these same optical probe-labeling strategies can be used in more
complex experiments to permit two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (2DFS), single-molecule Förster
Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) and Fluorescence-detected Linear Dichroism (smFLD), which provide
structural interpretations and follow the kinetics of reactions within these complexes in `real time' with µsec to
msec resolution. As described in the present proposal, these approaches now permit us to obtain structural and
dynamic information about local conformational changes that occur at defined and biologically-relevant base
analogue and DNA backbone probe sites, as well as to determine free energy surfaces (and define transition
states) of individual rate-limiting molecular steps within reconstituted models of relatively complete DNA
replication complexes. Using these approaches, we are beginning to reveal mechanisms of regulatory control
systems that have previously been inaccessible to direct experimental measurement."
10762436,"Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are a group of disorders associated with defects in primary cilia and often
causing end stage kidney disease. They can be divided into disorders mainly involving just kidney and liver,
nonsyndromic PKDs (NS-PKDs), and ones involving other organ systems, including the brain, skeleton, and
sensory organs, syndromic PKDs (S-PKDs). Autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD; PKHD1) is the main
recessively inherited NS-PKD, whereas S-PKDs are a group of diverse, mainly recessive diseases, including:
Meckel [MKS], Joubert syndrome [JBTS]; and short rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD), with up to 80 different genes
involved. S-PKDs have marked genetic complexity, for instance the gene, TMEM67, is associated with several
different disorders, and although the underlying reason for the varied phenotypes is not well understood, allelic
effects may be important. In addition, it is becoming clear that heterozygous carriers of recessive PKHD1 alleles
can have a mild cystic kidney/liver phenotype, similar to very mild autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD). We have
recently found that IFT140, an S-PKD gene encoding an intraflagella transport protein (IFT140) that is required
to generate a fully functional cilium, also has a heterozygous phenotype of mild kidney cyst development. The
goal of this grant is to better understand the genetic complexity associated with recessive (and sometimes
dominant) PKD, with the premise that understanding the effects of gene loss and reduction (gene dosage),
including the role of allelic effects, will improve our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of PKDs.
 Aim 1, Mutation screen a PKD positive and PKD unknown population to identify the role of
“recessive” PKD alleles to the etiology of S-PKD and NS-PKD, will conduct mutation screening using next
generation sequencing methods. A PKD cohort and a population of individuals not known to have PKD (Mayo
Clinic Biobank; n=53,220) will be screened to determine the etiology of the PKD population and evaluate the role
of single “recessive” PKD alleles to manifest as mild cystic disease. Aim 2, Develop cell-based assays to
evaluate NS-PKD (PKHD1) and S-PKD (TMEM67) alleles, will establish in vitro systems to determine the
pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance (VUS) in an NS-PKD gene, PKHD1, and an S-PKD gene,
TMEM67. Trafficking, maturation, and ciliary localization of products of these genes will be determined. Aim 3,
Explore the disease mechanism of IFT140 pathogenic alleles, will generate animal models to better
understand disease pathogenesis. Both conditional and hypomorphic allele approaches will be employed to
generate viable models and characterize the renal and extrarenal phenotypes. Aim 4, Determine ciliary defects
and genetic interactions associated with NS-PKD and S-PKD genes, will monitor ciliary trafficking and
composition in cells from NS-PKD and S-PKD models, and explore genetic interactions between these genes.
Overall, these studies will provide diagnosis, prognostic and mechanistic data, important steps toward
developing novel therapeutics for this group of devastating diseases."

 In September 2017, Hurricane Maria brought unprecedented devastation to Puerto Rico. The Hurricane’s
impact was disproportionately borne by elderly patients and residents of remote areas of Puerto Rico who were
vulnerable to disruptions in health care services. Providers and policymakers are currently seeking to make
major investments in Puerto Rico’s primary care delivery system that were outlined in Puerto Rico’s recovery
plan. However, the ability of Puerto Rico’s physician organizations (POs) to undertake large-scale primary care
transformation remains unclear. In particular, POs might differ widely in both their existing primary care
infrastructure as well as the level of technical or financial support they typically receive to implement new
infrastructure from the health systems or independent physicians associations with which they are affiliated,
from the Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations with which they contract, or
from the federal government. The proposed study, which builds on an existing collaboration between RAND
and the University of Puerto Rico, will examine four models of physician organization in Puerto Rico: federally
qualified health centers, small independent medical groups, large independent medical groups, and vertically-
integrated medical groups. We will use Medicare fee-for-service claims and Medicare Advantage encounter
data to assess trends in the physician workforce providing care through these four delivery models, the
Medicare beneficiaries who receive care through each model, and changes in both trends following Hurricane
Maria. We will then assess changes in access, quality of care, and care coordination before and after
Hurricane Maria to measure differences in performance across PO models and to identify high-performing POs
and low-performing POs in each model. We will conduct interviews with leaders of 32 of the highest-performing
POs and lowest-performing POs in each model to identify the advanced primary care infrastructure they have
sought to implement as well as implementation barriers. Finally, we will interview Medicare beneficiaries living
with Alzheimer’s disease (or Alzheimer’s disease related dementias) and their caregivers to better understand
their unmet care needs and how these needs differ across the four PO models. The research will be guided
and supported by an Advisory Committee comprising representatives of two local provider associations and
two local patient advocacy groups that represent older adults and people living with Alzheimer’s disease and
Alzheimer’s disease related dementias. The study will help to identify specific models of physician organization
that are associated with higher performance that could help guide Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria recovery
effort. Our findings could also help stakeholders prioritize the expansion of specific services that could most
directly improve the lives of patients with Alzheimer’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease related dementias and
their caregivers and identify the types of POs that might need greater support to address current gaps."

researchers in the fields of epidemiology and prevention. Importantly, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
reports that the employment of epidemiologists is projected to grow 26 percent from 2021 to 2031, much
faster than the average for all occupations. Meeting this surge in demand will require sustained support for
training programs across the U.S. This five-year proposal is for renewal of a longstanding training grant in
the epidemiology and prevention of cardiovascular disease administered by the Division of Epidemiology &
Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota. The program is highly successful,
having graduated 75 postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows since 1977. Among graduates in the past 15
years, 93% are currently in research positions, and 67% have obtained research funding, mostly from NIH.
The training program’s excellent facilities, large and diverse faculty, and broad research opportunities offer
an outstanding training environment. Our training program has continued to evolve and improve, to offer a
cutting-edge training experience in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and prevention.
 In the most recent period (2019-2024), the program was awarded four predoctoral and three
postdoctoral fellowship positions. Positions have been filled throughout and we continue to have
outstanding applicants. Trainees from underrepresented groups comprised 43% of predocs and 29% of
postdocs appointed in the last five years. A total of 14 different faculty have served as a formal mentor for at
least one trainee during this same time period, demonstrating the breadth of expertise available to the
trainees and the extent of involvement of participating faculty in the delivery of training. Fellows have been
highly productive, generating impactful publications and presenting at national and international meetings.
Our proposal for renewal (2024-2029) is to maintain seven fellowship positions per year – three postdoctoral
and four predoctoral.
 The University of Minnesota T32 fellowship program offers outstanding training opportunities in direct
research experience combined with a strong curriculum of formal coursework, seminars and expert
mentorship. The participation of disadvantaged trainees is a high priority for the fellowship. The
uniqueness of the training is the commitment of its faculty and the breadth of existing research, from the
laboratory to the community. The continued need for qualified cardiovascular epidemiologists and the

provide training in the applications of biological and physical sciences to biotechnology-related research. The
CBB and Iowa Biotech-TP create a vibrant community of trainees and dedicated faculty trainers from four
University of Iowa colleges and ten academic departments. The Iowa Biotech-TP is administered by a
Leadership Team and an Executive Committee. An External Advisory Board of biotechnology industry leaders
provides independent input to assure relevance to the needs of the biotechnology industry and research.
Our Iowa Biotech-TP will train future leaders in biotechnology-related research and will equip them to succeed
in industrial, academic and governmental research enterprises. Our cohort of trainees will come from different
scientific and cultural backgrounds and will be trained in a way that fosters effective communication with one
another, which is critical to our ability to make significant advances in biotechnology in the future. The Iowa
Biotech-TP is designed to provide a deep and diverse education to trainees, including academic training
covering qualitative and quantitative aspects of biotechnology, hands-on introduction to industrial methods,
and preparation for professional life in biotechnology. Trainees are required to: a) complete an industrial
internship lasting three months; b) must complete at least three (3) semester hours of coursework in four of
five core areas of biotechnology (Biocatalytic Sciences, Bioprocessing, Molecular and Synthetic Biology, Data
Handling and Computational Analysis, and Professional Development); c) take courses in Responsible
Conduct of Research and Mastering Reproducible Science; d) participate in the “Perspectives in
Biotechnology” class and activities every semester including presentations at the annual CBB and the annual
Iowa Biotech-TP Spring Symposium; e) participate in TP's seminars; and f) participate in various trainee-
cohort career building and networking activities. Our fifteen proposed trainees (9 NIH and 6 CBB fellows) will
be selected annually toward the end of their first year in graduate school, and support for trainees may be
renewed for up to two years, however all trainees continue in the program until graduation. The recruiting pool
is based not on departmental affiliation but on interest in biotechnology and graduate training. In addition to
six fellowships, the CBB will provide administrative support, as well as financial support to offset the effort of
the Iowa Biotech-TP leadership team. The CBB will also provide training in industrial settings and will expose
trainees to commercial aspects of biotechnology. These CBB matching funds will greatly increase the
effectiveness of the funds requested from NIH and ensures an extensive industrial emphasis in training."

In this 5-year renewal application for the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and University of
Washington (UW) program entitled, Women and HIV: Translation of Research into Practice, will continue to build
research capacity to prevent new HIV infections among women and adolescent girls in Kenya and sub-Saharan
Africa and optimize care and treatment for this high-risk, vulnerable population. To reduce incident infections
and ensure long, healthy lives for persons living with HIV, it is necessary to conduct locally relevant research
that addresses the know-do gap and informs national guidelines, clinical practice and policy. It is also essential
that communities and local health officials participate in identifying the most pressing problems and in finding
feasible, sustainable and innovative solutions to address them. The proposed training program’s primary goal is
to build capacity at KEMRI and the Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) in implementation science focused on HIV,
women and adolescents, while creating bridges to communities of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW),
local health officials, and other organizations responsible for healthcare practice and service delivery. KEMRI’s
strong commitment to conducting research that informs service delivery and improves national health outcomes
in Kenya provides a strong foundation for the program, which will continue to be led by Drs. Carey Farquhar and
Elizabeth Bukusi. Dr. Farquhar is a UW Professor of Global Health, Medicine, and Epidemiology recently
appointed Vice Dean for Education in the School of Public Health. Dr. Bukusi is a Chief Research Officer at
KEMRI who trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and epidemiologist, earning her MPH and PhD at UW. The
first aim builds on the successful first 4 years of the training program. Seven Kenyans received support for long-
term training during this period: 4 MPH, 2 PhD, and 1 MPH/PhD. In addition, 5 trainees completed medium-
term, non-degree training at UW. In the next 5 years, we propose to fund more doctoral level training in-country,
supporting 6 trainees from KEMRI or MOH to pursue a PhD in implementation science at the University of
Nairobi. To ensure a pipeline of candidates, we will also support 5 MPH trainees at UW and 5 year-long certificate
trainees who will be based primarily in Kenya and take 1 month of coursework in Seattle, followed by workshops
and UW distance-learning courses in Kenya. The third aim will extend the reach of training to a greater number
of KEMRI and MOH staff by providing 1-week courses on implementation science, grant writing, and manuscript
preparation. Conferences that bring together members of the AGYW community with KEMRI and MOH
researchers and county health directors will be offered to promote community engagement in local care,
treatment and prevention in Western Kenya, where adolescents and women are at unacceptably high risk for
HIV. Using UW’s well-established approaches to training, this program will establish greatly needed

10768621,"Globally, nearly 10 million older adults are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs)
each year. Given the current absence of effective pharmacological treatments, along with global disparities in
dementia care, there is an urgent need to identify population-level targets of ADRDs prevention and intervention,
including at the family and societal level. Much of the population-level ADRDs research focuses on the
contributions of one’s own socio-economic status (SES) to later life ADRDs risk. However, in many global
settings, the SES of adult children may be a critical driver of parents’ economic, informational, and behavioral
resources in late life. Nevertheless, very little research has evaluated the impact of adult child SES on parents’
ADRDs risk or outcomes of ADRDs. This is a surprisingly overlooked opportunity given prior literature suggesting
that adult child educational attainment may influence parents’ physical and mental health and mortality
outcomes, independent of parents’ own education. The objective of this proposed study is to rigorously
evaluate the potential for adult child SES to reduce parental ADRDs risk and improve outcomes among
older parents with ADRDs in global settings. We will additionally evaluate a comprehensive set of
economic and non-economic pathways that may underlie observed associations and identify subgroups
of older adults who may benefit most from improvements to their children’s education. We propose to
use population-level cohort data on over 156,000 adults representing 20 countries in North and Central America,
Asia, and Europe, and with similar measures of adult child education and rich data on candidate mediators and
multi-level modifiers. These global data will allow us to achieve excellent external validity not possible with single-
country studies, and we will use rigorous observational approaches for analyses of main effects and mediation.
To maximize internal validity, we will validate observational estimates with a quasi-experimental approach that
leverages changes to compulsory schooling laws as “natural experiments” to identify the causal effect of
increases to adult child education on parents’ longitudinal cognitive outcomes. We have gathered an
interdisciplinary team with deep expertise in these global aging cohort data and the application of rigorous
epidemiologic and econometric methods to population-level research on cognitive aging to carry out the following
Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the influence of adult child SES on older parents’ cognitive decline, risk of probable
dementia or cognitive impairment, and outcomes for older parents after dementia onset, 2) Evaluate economic
and non-economic mediators of observed associations between adult child SES and parents’ ADRDs risk and
outcomes, and 3) Identify within and cross-country heterogeneity in the association between adult child SES and
parents’ ADRD risk and outcomes. Our study makes use of the over 20 years of investment of the National
Institute on Aging in global aging cohort studies to evaluate largely unanswered questions regarding the influence
of adult child SES on parents’ ADRDs risk and outcomes."
10768734,"Home healthcare (HHC) is the fastest growing healthcare sector and an important source of care for older
Americans, including populations that historically have been vulnerable to health disparities. HHC patients are
at high risk for infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on infection prevention and control
(IPC). However, our prior work indicates that HHC IPC capacity (i.e., IPC staffing, general IPC procedures,
infection specific policies and employee IPC training policies) was sub-optimal and IPC preparedness (i.e.,
planning for and responding to an infectious disease crisis) was insufficient before the pandemic. Informed by
our work in the parent grant “Infection Prevention in Home Health Care (InHOME, R01 NR016865)” and guided
by Donabedian’s Quality Model and the Minority Health and Health Disparities Framework, in this competitive
renewal we propose a 5-year, mixed methods study with 4 aims: 1) To describe changes in HHC IPC capacity
and preparedness over time and its association with vulnerable populations; 2) To examine associations
between HHC IPC capacity and HHC patient outcomes, overall and in vulnerable populations; 3) To examine
the feasibility and potential barriers to implementing best practices in IPC capacity and preparedness through
qualitative interviews with HHC personnel; and, 4) To develop evidence-based recommendations for improving
HHC IPC capacity and preparedness to reduce the burden of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infections in HHC.
In Aim 1, we will conduct two national surveys of HHC agencies (n = 600 per survey) in 2022 and 2024 and link
them with our 2019 survey. We will assess the evolution of HHC IPC capacity and preparedness across the
nation. In Aim 2, we will estimate the associations between HHC IPC capacity and HHC patient outcomes
(infections, mortality) by linking our surveys with longitudinal HHC assessments (i.e., the Outcome and
Assessment Information Set), Medicare claims and encounters data, and COVID-19 environment data. In Aim
3, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 60 purposively selected HHC personnel (i.e., 20 HHC agencies, 3
participants per agency) to discuss our findings, gather insights, and gain perspectives from those with
firsthand experience implementing IPC policies and caring for patients. In Aim 4, we will conduct systematic
literature review and synthesize our findings to inform a Delphi panel made up of key stakeholders (i.e.,
experts, leaders, advocates, patients and caregivers). We will develop clinical and policy recommendations
refined and endorsed by our Delphi panel. This will result in data-driven, evidence-based recommendations
that we will widely disseminate. Our multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to conduct this study. Leveraging
our unique baseline data, our study will be the first comprehensive examination of IPC changes in HHC through
the pandemic and its impact on patient outcomes. The results will provide recommendations to strengthen HHC
agencies’ IPC capacity and preparedness to more effectively respond to the current and future infectious
disease crises, protect the millions of Americans using HHC services every year, and reduce health disparities."
10768739,"Uncontrolled activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK), the key cellular regulator of NF-­κB, causes a variety of disorders, including susceptibility to pathogenic infection, autoimmunity, inflammation-­induced malignancies, and inflammatory syndromes. However, targeting the IKK-­NF-­kB signaling pathway has not yielded any new strategies for fighting inflammatory illnesses. The lack of understanding of how IKK becomes activated in response to various stimuli is the fundamental reason for our failure to exploit this unambiguous target. The IKK
complex is made up of three subunits, catalytic IKK1 (also known as IKKα) and IKK2/β kinases, which form a heterodimer, and the dimeric scaffolding protein NEMO (NF-­κB Essential Modulator), which is stably bound to the heterodimer. In vitro and in cells, this fundamental tetrameric unit of the IKK complex (IKK1:IKK2:NEMO2), emerges as significantly higher molecular weight multimers. The catalytic activation of IKK2, referred to as canonical signaling, requires linear (M1-­linked), K63-­linked, or mixed poly-­ubiquitin chains (Ub-­chain) that
engage noncovalently with the NEMO subunits. The mechanism by which this binding information is transferred from NEMO:Ub-­chain interaction to yield IKK2 subunit phosphorylation and subsequent activation of IKK is unknown. We hypothesize that multimerization via dimer-­dimer interaction is required for IKK2 activation and
that the tetramer interface stabilizes the native IKK complex, allowing NEMO to undergo conformational changes upon binding to the Ub-­chain. The kinase domain of the IKK2 subunit is activated as a result of structural alterations in NEMO. Disease-­causing NEMO mutations or mutations at the tetramer interface do not support the assembly and Ub-­chain-­dependent NEMO conformational changes required for IKK activation. In support of our hypothesis, we have already shown that a short peptide segment derived from NEMO interacts with IKK2 in
a signal-­dependent manner and that IKK multimerization requires short homologous peptide segments within IKK1 and IKK2. Under this proposal, we will achieve the following specific aims: AIM 1. We will characterize the dimer-­dimer interface which is required for IKK multimerization. We will use disease-­causing NEMO mutants and IKK multimerization-­defective mutants to test how the structural plasticity of NEMO is linked to IKK2 activation.
AIM 2. We will determine if the IKK1-­ and IKK2-­derived peptides disrupt dimer-­dimer interaction and IKK2 activation in cells and in vivo. We will test if the IKK-­derived peptides independently and in combination with the NEMO-­derived peptide can ameliorate systemic inflammation and collagen-­induced arthritis in mouse models."
11160909,"Abstract
Latino adults in the United States (U.S.) are 1.5 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
related dementias (ADRD) compared to non-Hispanic white adults. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects
9.8% of Latino adults and confers a five-fold increased risk of AD diagnosis5. Consequences also extend to the
bedpartner, as bedpartners of those with OSA experience significant sleep disturbances, including sleep
fragmentation and 3 times greater risk of insomnia. Given solid mechanistic links between both OSA and
insomnia and ADRD risk, effective OSA treatment has the potential to promote healthy cognitive aging and
reduce ADRD risk for both partners. While the front-line treatment for OSA, positive airway pressure (PAP), is
highly effective at reducing OSA symptoms and may reduce or forestall ADRD risk, its potential is severely
diminished, as up to 80% of patients are non-adherent. Extant PAP adherence interventions are limited in that
they are exclusively focused on the individual, neglecting to consider the role of the bedpartner in treatment,
and developed primarily in non-Hispanic white populations. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop
evidence-based, and culturally-adapted interventions that address the impact of OSA and its treatment on both
partners and within a culturally-tailored framework. The goal of this R61/33 proposal is to develop and
test “Nuestro Sueño” a culturally-adapted intervention to promote PAP adherence and sleep
health among Latino couples. This proposal builds on and extends our team’s recently completed R21
project called “WePAP”, a brief (3 session) telehealth intervention to promote PAP adherence and sleep health
among couples with OSA. Pilot data demonstrates our intervention is feasible, acceptable and shows promise
for improving adherence, sleep, relationship quality and cognitive function for patient and partners. Therefore,
in the next steps, we propose to 1) Conduct a rigorous cultural adaptation and testing process of Nuestro
Sueño, utilizing input from a community advisory board, patient/partner focus groups and field testing and 2)
Conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility, treatment satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of
Nuestro Sueño versus information control (IC) in a sample of 80 OSA patients and their partners (i.e., 40
couples per treatment arm) across two sites (Utah and Arizona). The intervention focuses specifically on the
interpersonal mechanisms of enhancing dyadic coping and communication, using intervention materials
resonant with cultural beliefs and values. If successful, Nuestro Sueño, an innovative and culturally-adapted
intervention, has the potential to significantly advance the treatment of OSA, and may elucidate a critical,
modifiable target of prevention and intervention to promote healthy aging and reduce disparities in ADRD risk
among Latino couples."
10766946,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This T32 renewal application seeks continued support for the Precision Lifestyle Medicine and Translation
Research (PREMIER) training program at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). The program impact goal is
to build a transdisciplinary, translational research training infrastructure for postdoctoral fellows who aspire to
be both independent investigators and team scientists in precision lifestyle medicine. Specifically, the program
will train highly talented and motivated postdoctoral scholars to be future leaders in research addressing the
prevention and control of cardiovascular and respiratory chronic conditions and comorbidities. The specific
aims are to: (1) Recruit and train a superb and diverse cadre of fellows; (2) Provide an academic “incubator”
for an inspiring mentored research experience and individualized professional development; and (3) Sustain a
pipeline of dedicated, skilled mentors at all academic ranks. PREMIER has 3 integrative scientific foci:
Behavioral Sciences for Multimorbidity Prevention and Control as the central, patient-oriented research
focused core; and the Mechanisms of Behavior Change and Disease and the Population Health Equity and
Policy cores traversing the central core. Supported by the Internal and External Advisory Committees, the
Executive Committee, consisting of the 2 MPIs and the 2 co-leaders of each scientific core, will provide
intellectual leadership and programmatic oversight. These 8 faculty along with 27 others from 6 science
colleges at UIC (Medicine, Public Health, Applied Health Sciences, Nursing, Computer Science, Liberal Arts
and Sciences) are PREMIER mentors. Collectively, they bring deep research and mentorship expertise,
extensive professional experiences, and essential resources. Building on successes to date, the renewed
program will support 12 full-time postdoctoral trainees in years 6-10, with enhanced diversity of the Executive
Committee, expanded training faculty across all 3 scientific cores, and addition of faculty expertise and training
resources in data sciences and methods. Every fellow will receive group mentorship from 1 primary mentor
associated with the core of central interest to the fellow and 1-2 secondary mentors from either or both of the
other cores. One of the mentors must have established expertise in Behavioral Sciences for Multimorbidity
Prevention and Control. Fellows will devote at least 75% effort to mentored research, supplemented by
conferences, seminars, and coursework (which, when appropriate, may lead to a master’s degree, such as a
Master of Science in Clinical Translational Science) based on individual needs. Fellows will be selected from a
national pool of MD and PhD (or equivalent) applicants seeking research training at UIC, which qualifies as a
minority-serving higher education institution. Selection criteria focus on past accomplishments and especially
on their potential as future researchers and educators, and training under-represented minority (URM) scholars
is a priority. Each trainee will develop an individual development plan (IDP), and progress is to be continuously
monitored and formally evaluated. A multi-level evaluation plan is designed to ensure high quality training."

Curation and Statistical Analysis Core
Core Director: Kathy Panageas (MSK)
The Curation and Statistical Analysis Core will be co-led by Drs. Katherine Panageas and Deb Schrag, who
have a long-standing role in the AACR GENIE PRISSMM data curation efforts to date. The PRISSMM
framework includes data collection with respect to: Pathology; Radiology; Imaging; Signs and Symptoms; tumor
Markers; and Medical oncologist assessments. The phenomic, therapeutic, and oncologic outcome data are
curated from the electronic health record (EHR) and other institutional data sources according to the patient-
and cancer-centric PRISSMM framework for determination of real-world cancer outcomes. PRISSMM utilizes
a cancer-agnostic curation model that standardizes key components of outcome ascertainment in oncology
based on existing data standards. Specifically, all pathology reports, all radiology reports for imaging studies
other than plain x-rays and ultrasounds, and one medical oncologist note per month are curated. Aim 1 of the
Core will be to develop and maintain data standards to support consistent and transparent abstraction of clinical
data from electronic health records. Curation initiatives require assessment of different components of data
quality throughout the curation process. Multi-pronged QA processes will be implemented and evaluated as
part of the Core to address feasibility, accuracy, and reproducibility. In order to assess whether real world
progression-free survival (PFS) determined using the PRISSMM data model (based on imaging, PFS-I or
based on medical oncologist assessment PFS-M) approximates PFS based on RECIST, the gold standard for
defining disease progression in the clinical trial setting, radiologist measurements will be performed and
interpretations will be compiled with PRISSMM outcomes. The statistical aspects of the design and analysis of
the clinico-genomic analyses in our proposal share many common elements as they relate to analysis of
complex genomic data, nuances of PRISSMM data model and patient populations. Aim 2 of the Core will be to
provide methodologic and biostatistics support and collaboration for individual observational data analysis.
Dedicated shared resources for expert biostatistics and genomics analyses for our P01 program will ensure
the necessary rigor and reproducibility critical to our proposed studies."
10769288,"Project Summary
The Biological Discovery through Chemical Innovation training program (BDCI TP) is a new, innovative
predoctoral training program at Emory University, focused on providing specialized training in interdisciplinary
science to students working at the critical intersection of chemistry, biology, and human health, with a particular
emphasis on drug discovery and development. Emory provides a rich environment for this training program, with
demonstrated strengths and depth of knowledge across several disciplines from basic science to translational
research and clinical practice. This program aims to provide trainees with the knowledge, language, and skills
needed to tackle the most pressing challenges in human health and disease, and ultimately prepare them for
diverse careers in the biomedical workforce. To do this, we have carefully designed a training program that
provides specialized, interdisciplinary training to supplement the foundational, discipline-specific training they
will receive in their home graduate programs. Trainees in the BDCI TP will be supported during years 2 and 3 of
their graduate training and will be drawn from several different graduate programs, including Chemistry and a
strategic group of programs in the life sciences within the Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical
Sciences. With a specific emphasis on driving diversity within the program, the BDCI TP will support 6 students
per cohort, for a total of 12 students per year as the program matures. Designed to provide significant value to
trainees, the BDCI TP includes a new interdisciplinary course focused on therapeutic discovery and
development, a new workshop series aimed at driving cross-disciplinary language development and tailored
ethics and rigor training in the area of interdisciplinary/team science, an annual symposium for trainees to present
their work and network with leaders in the field of chemical biology, an immersive research experience outside
their mentor’s laboratory, a bi-annual retreat with other CBI programs at complementary institutions, and support
for trainees to pursue unique professional development opportunities. Altogether, this program will equip trainees
to succeed in the increasingly interdisciplinary field of modern therapeutic innovation."
10771294,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1
Project 1 is highly integrated with the other projects in this SRP proposal, and the primary goal is directly in line
with the theme of the center, “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure and elucidating mechanisms
underlying iAs-induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease prevention.” The project addresses the
important public health issue of diabetes associated with environmental exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs). It
focuses on liver and pancreatic beta cell microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) as potential
mechanisms of iAs-associated diabetes. The project co-leaders are Drs. Sethupathy and Styblo, experts in
miRNA function and iAs toxicology. iAs has been highlighted as a diabetogen by the National Toxicology
Program (NTP) 2012 review. Diabetes is a complex disorder that affects hundreds of millions of people
worldwide, has no cure, is associated with numerous debilitating co-morbidities, and is a growing public health
concern. Chronic exposure to iAs is a global problem as over 100 million people around the world (~13 million
in US) drink water with unsafe levels of iAs and many more are exposed to iAs in food. Our prior research has
shown that exposure to iAs is associated with increased prevalence of diabetes, and that impaired insulin
secretion by pancreatic beta cells or impaired insulin signaling (insulin resistance) may underlie the diabetogenic
effects of iAs. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of these effects are unknown. This proposal builds upon
a productive collaboration between Drs. Sethupathy and Styblo and is based on robust preliminary data that
points to miRNAs and TFs as strong candidate mechanistic links between iAs and diabetes. Over the last
decade, specific miRNAs and TFs have independently emerged as markers of iAs exposure and as potential
regulators of diabetes pathways. iAs exposure has been associated with significant changes in the levels of
miRNAs and TFs in different tissues and cell lines. Importantly, some of these miRNAs and TFs have also been
linked to diabetes in separate studies. Despite such intriguing findings, the relationship between iAs-exposure
and miRNAs or TFs in diabetes has never been formally investigated. The goal of this study is to bridge this
knowledge gap. Our central hypothesis is that specific miRNAs and TFs drive the diabetes phenotypes
associated with iAs exposure, and that manipulation of these miRNAs and TFs will rescue these
phenotypes. We will test this hypothesis through the use of in vitro cell-based systems, in vivo mouse models,
and human samples. Given the potential for exposure to iAs and the public health issue of diabetes,
understanding the complex relationships between environmental risk factors for diabetes is of critical importance."
10771297,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2
Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a ubiquitous, naturally-occurring environmental toxicant that affects over 200 million
people worldwide. Chronic exposure to iAs is associated with numerous human diseases, including type 2
diabetes (T2D). Results of epidemiological studies suggest that efficiency of iAs metabolism, which depends in
part on polymorphisms in iAs-methyltransferase (AS3MT) and on other genetic factors, affects the risk of T2D
risk in iAs-exposed populations. Obesity, the number 1 risk factor for T2D, has also been shown to modify iAs
metabolism and a recent study found that obese individuals are at higher risk of developing T2D when exposed
to iAs. In addition, our preliminary studies show that obesity exacerbates T2D phenotype in iAs-exposed mice in
a sex-dependent manner, and that the responses to the diabetogenic effects iAs exposure differ between
genetically diverse mouse strains. Project 2 addresses a fundamental gap in understanding the interaction
between iAs exposure, iAs metabolism, genetics, obesity and sex in the context of type T2D etiology. Our goal
is to determine the relative contributions of these five critical factors to T2D risk, using genetically diverse male
and female mice with different capacities to metabolize iAs. We hypothesize that there is an interaction
between iAs exposure, iAs metabolism and obesity that increases the risk of T2D, and that the outcome
depends on genetic background and sex. We plan to use a unique mouse population, the Collaborative Cross,
to test our hypothesis. Four key findings underlie our hypothesis: (1) Polymorphisms in AS3MT are linked to both
the differences in the capacity to metabolize (methylate) iAs and to T2D risk in populations exposed to iAs; (2)
methylated metabolites of iAs are more potent than iAs as inhibitors of beta cell function and insulin signaling in
laboratory models; (3) obesity affects iAs metabolism and increases T2D risk in humans, and exacerbates
diabetic phenotype in mice exposed to iAs; finally (4) genetics, which is known to influence metabolic health in
obese individuals, has also been shown to affect susceptibility to the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure in both
mice and humans. This project is led by a strong team (Drs. Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Styblo, Fry and Zou) with
complimentary expertise in genetics, molecular biology, iAs toxicology and metabolism, iAs-induced T2D and
statistics. We use the unique Collaborative Cross population, state of the art techniques and carefully controlled
experimental design to characterize the interaction between iAs exposure, iAs metabolism and obesity that
increases the risk of T2D, and will establish the influence of genetic background and sex. The project is aligned
with the theme of the UNC-SRP “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure and elucidating mechanisms
underlying iAs-induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease prevention.” New mechanistic
understanding of the role of obesity, genetics, sex and dose in disease, along with the vision of translating these
findings to human populations, will enable novel tangible solutions to mitigate the effects of iAs-induced T2D."
10771299,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3
Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) affects large human populations worldwide and leads to a number of human
diseases, including diabetes. Project 3 addresses a fundamental gap in understanding mechanisms underlying
iAs-induced diabetes – specifically the role of the gut microbiome. The association between iAs and diabetes
has been established in numerous epidemiological studies. We and others have also demonstrated that iAs
induces dysregulation of glucose and insulin metabolism in mice. The gut microbiome has a profound effect on
human health through its key role in metabolic regulation, and emerges as a promising target for intervention
and therapeutic treatment in human health. Accumulating evidence supports the role of the gut microbiome and
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the pathogenies and prevention of diabetes in both animals and humans. Our
studies are among the first to demonstrate the functional interactions between iAs and the gut microbiome. Still,
precisely how the iAs-altered gut microbiome affects diabetes risk remains to be determined. In particular, the
molecular mechanisms underlying iAs-microbiome-host crosstalk are largely unknown. This represents a
significant gap in iAs-microbiome research, which also impedes mechanism-based interventions to reduce
arsenic-induced diabetes via targeting the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions. Our central hypothesis
is that modulation of the gut microbiome will serve as a method for reduction of iAs-perturbed metabolic
dysfunction/diabetes. Specifically, iAs-altered gut microbiome disrupts bile acids to inhibit FXR, which in turn
alters gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling. Our robust preliminary data underscore the key role of microbiome-
bile acid-FXR axis in iAs-induced diabetes, and highlight the potential to modulate iAs toxicity by targeting FXR
via microbiome. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: Aim 1: Establish the functional link
between altered gut microbiota and iAs-impaired bile acid metabolism; Aim 2: Determine the effects of inhibited
FXR activation, driven by iAs-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis, on gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling; and
Aim 3: Mediate iAs-induced diabetes via restoring FXR activation by gut microbiome manipulation. Our strong
team (Drs. Lu, Sartor, Styblo and McDermott) has complimentary expertise in iAs toxicity, gut microbiome, iAs
metabolism and iAs-induced diabetes. We use innovative techniques to characterize largely unknown
contributions of gut microbiome-bile acid-FXR in iAs-induced diabetes and the project is in line with the theme
of the UNC-SRP “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure and elucidating mechanisms underlying iAs-
induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease prevention.” The highly modifiable nature of the gut
microbiome and in-depth mechanistic understanding of the role of microbiome in disease will allow us to develop
new tangible approaches to reduce iAs-induced diabetes by targeting the gut microbiome and related signaling
molecules."
10771301,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 4
Project 4 seeks to better understand the factors that result in solubilization of iAs and related oxyanion-forming
trace elements (V, Cr) in well water. It is generally accepted that biogeochemical processes (rock weathering,
redox transformations) control solubilization of these contaminants from aquifer materials. However, detailed
mechanistic understanding of subsurface processes and an ability to apply biogeochemical parameters as
predictors of contamination are lacking, and as a result, drinking-water wells may be susceptible to
contamination. The central hypothesis is that the concentrations of specific rock- and groundwater-
hosted chemical oxidants can be used to predict the risks of iAs, V, and Cr contamination in drinking-
water wells, guide remediation strategies for co-contaminated sites, and facilitate health interventions.
This topic is particularly relevant in North Carolina, which has 20 Superfund sites with documented As, as well
as significant population utilizing drinking-water wells with elevated iAs, V, and Cr from geogenic sources. We
thus propose a multipronged plan that integrates field, laboratory, and spectroscopic measurements with
mechanistic and geospatial modeling to (1) develop a comprehensive multiscale understanding of the contrasting
redox-driven mechanisms of iAs, V, and Cr solubilization, and (2) derive tools for predicting current and future
contamination of well water. The use of fundamental research to develop geochemical predictors of
contamination is aligned with the theme of the center “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure and
elucidating mechanisms underlying iAs-induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease prevention.”
proposed research will facilitate disease prevention by guiding future well placement and monitoring efforts,
potentially increasing awareness and decreasing exposure to naturally occurring toxic trace elements.
Furthermore, this research will motivate novel interventions for responding to contaminants in the environment,
including geogenically impacted sites in North Carolina, as well as in anthropogenically impacted locations such
as Superfund sites."
10771304,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 5
In the US, 14% of Americans rely on private wells as their drinking water source. In NC, geogenic and
anthropogenic contaminants (e.g., inorganic arsenic (iAs), manganese, chromium, and vanadium) infiltrate
private wells, placing residents at risk for health outcomes (e.g., diabetes associated with iAs exposure). An
estimated ~3 million individuals representing one-third of the population in NC drink water from private wells
with iAs concentrations up to 800 µg/L. The US EPA and NC-DHHS recommend reverse osmosis membrane
filtration and solid media to remove iAs from well water because these technologies require the fewest chemicals
and steps to remove iAs and are easy to implement. However, two important challenges to these two
technologies in this context are that both: (i) inadequately remove As(III) (i.e., the most hazardous iAs species),
and (ii) produce iAs-enriched waste. Of the two technologies, membranes are best suited to treat groundwater
because compared to solid media, they are more effective at removing As(III), are easier to operate, are more
compact, and afford faster access to clean water. However, membrane systems allow iAs-enriched brines to re-
enter into the water cycle and are not designed specifically to remove iAs and co-occurring contaminants (CCs).
Arguably, the most valuable advantage solid media has over membranes is that the resulting iAs-enriched waste
is easier to dispose. We hypothesize that an integrated membrane-sorbent system will remove iAs and
CCs from groundwater with better efficacy than existing in-home water treatment systems, while
minimizing iAs re-entry into the environment. Project 5 therefore aligns with the theme of the UNC-SRP
Center, “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure and elucidating mechanisms underlying iAs-
induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease prevention” and addresses SRP Mandate 4 in
using hypothesis-driven research to develop a product-oriented solution for communities affected by exposure
to iAs and CCs. Project 5 will address research gaps to: (i) develop technologies that effectively remove As(III)
from water without chemical pretreatment; (ii) optimize the ability of membranes to remove iAs, especially As(III),
without compromising water productivity; (iii) develop sorbents to treat iAs-containing membrane brines; (iv)
introduce the concept of removing geogenic and anthropogenic CCs (i.e., Mn(II), Cr, V) from waters in addition
to the primary contaminant of concern (iAs); and (v) introduce biomedical metrics to assess performance of iAs
membrane filtration systems. We will accomplish our goals with three specific aims: First, we will develop and
optimize membranes to remove iAs and CCs from groundwater by combining polyamide, sulfonated poly(ether
ether ketone) (sPEEK), and/or mixed-matrix chemistries; Second, we will optimize a polyethylenimine (PEI)-
based granular sorbent for iAs and CCs removal from membrane brine; Third, we will deploy an integrated
membrane-sorbent system prototype and evaluate it for performance stability in impacted NC communities."
10781916,"Abstract
T cell-centered immunotherapies, including PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, have been successful
in treating some types of cancers but not others. The roles of other immune cells including
immunosuppressive monocytic cells in tumor development and treatment are not well
defined. A better understanding of the molecular regulation of signaling and function of
these monocytic cells will support development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer
treatment. The leukocyte Ig-like receptor subfamily B (LILRB) proteins are a group of type
I transmembrane glycoproteins with extracellular Ig-like domains that bind ligands and
intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that can recruit
tyrosine phosphatases SHP1, SHP2, or the inositol-phosphatase SHIP. We have been
investigating the roles of this family of immune checkpoint receptors in tumor
development. We demonstrated that several ITIM-receptors including LILRB2, LILRB4,
and a related receptor LAIR1 support leukemia development. As the most restrictively
expressed member of the LILRB family, LILRB4 is mainly expressed on monocytic cells
but not on stem cells or progenitors. We and others further demonstrated that LILRB4 is
a surface marker for monocytic AML and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells.
Importantly, we elucidated two novel functions of LILRB4: it supports infiltration of
malignant monocytic cells and relieves immune inhibition of T cells. Furthermore, we
developed anti-LILRB4 blocking antibodies and CAR-T cells that efficiently inhibit
monocytic leukemia development in various mouse models including humanized and
patient-derived xenografted mice. Here, based on new preliminary results, we propose the
following Aims to test the hypothesis that the expression and signaling of LILRB4 in
immunosuppressive monocytic cells support tumor development. In Aim 1, we will
determine the function of LILRB4 signaling in immunosupressive monocytic cells and
whether LILRB4 blocking/targeting inhibits tumor development. We will then determine
how LILRB4 expression is transcriptionally regulated by extrinsic factors in Aim 2. Finally
we will determine whether the DNA sensor protein Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a key
downstream effector of LILRB4 signaling in Aim 3. Our study will provide important
mechanistic insights into immune checkpoint biology and directly guide the development
of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment."
10781917,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data
that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date,
EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage,
response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even
when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and
may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis
of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients
potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research,
since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to
better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time-
specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning
techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural
language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic
endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on
leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My
specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model
by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to
a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial
protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial
matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the
independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting
scalable cancer research using EHR data."
10782012,"In this SBIR FastTrack proposal, Micro-Leads will develop HD64—a high-resolution, 64-
channel spinal cord stimulation therapy to provide more pain relief with greater specificity for those suffering
from chronic neuropathic pain and opioid dependence. Over 25 million in the U.S. suffer from debilitating pain
in the trunk and extremities and 55% depend on opioids to ease their suffering. Opioid abuse has claimed the
lives of over 200,000 over the past decade and has resulted in devastating reductions in quality of life, in ability
to work, and in mental health for the living. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has provided pain relief for 60% of
those with chronic extremity pain and eliminated opioid use entirely in more than 50%. Despite these advantages,
SCS has had a limited success treating isolated pain of the knee, foot, groin, or low-back. The lateral positioned
fibers of the spinal cord (ex. the dorsal root entry zone and dorsal horn) represent a more selective neural targeting
opportunity yet current, implantable plate-type surgical leads are too rigid and bulky to access these fibers without
a significant risk of paralysis or nerve root compression.
 HD64 provides an ultra-thin and conformal blanket of stimulation contacts across the entire width of the
spinal cord. Active-lead technology embeds a tiny electronic chip within the surgical lead and doubles the number
of therapy contacts compared with current technology without increasing the number of lead-wires. Collectively,
these features improve therapy and simplify surgical workflow. A novel Active-Lead Controller Implantable
Pulse Generator (AL-IPG) powers the chip safely, synchronizes with the active-lead electronics, configures the 8
programmable “therapy groups”, and ensures therapy pulses are delivered to the tissue. HD64 therapy is a highly
significant, novel solution for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic pain and opioids.
 PHASE 1: A cadaveric pilot run followed by a non-significant risk intraoperative study (n=6) will be
performed to inform the geometric and electrophysiological design parameters of high-resolution HD64 arrays.
The study will evaluate activation of medial and lateral spinal targets as measured by intraoperative
neuromonitoring of electromyography. At the end of Phase 1, the clinical feasibility of HD64 surgical leads will
be established. PHASE 2: In Phase 2, we have HD64 active leads assembled by a GMP manufacturer. We will
develop an external Active Lead Pulse Generator and charger which will be submitted for IDE approval. We will
perform an Early Feasibility Study Human Trial using active HD64 and AL-IPG hardware (n=10 subjects, n=23
therapy groups, n=2 waveforms). During Phase 2, we will also perform mechanical and electrical design
verification testing and chronic safety studies in large animals to demonstrate functional performance to inform
the final device. By the end of Phase 2, we will have completed all necessary tasks to inform the final device
design and to enable follow-on implanted longitudinal studies of chronic pain and opioid reduction."
10782161,"Summary: ABO(H) blood group antigens and corresponding anti-ABO(H) alloantibodies were discovered over
a century ago as the first polymorphisms in the human population and continue to be the most common
immunological barrier to transfusion and transplantation. However, despite the fundamental nature of this
discovery, very little is surprisingly known regarding the factors that govern anti-ABO(H) antibody formation or
the fine details of the ABO(H) alloantigen targets responsible for hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). As a
result, current approaches designed to detect ABO(H) antigens and anti-ABO(H) antibodies largely rely on the
same agglutination strategy leveraged by Landsteiner over 122 years ago. While ABO(H) incompatible RBC
transfusion can result in a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR), only half of patients who receive ABO(H)
incompatible RBCs experience this outcome. However, the factors that contribute to variable ABO(H)
incompatible HTRs remain largely unknown. This limitation in our understanding is a direct consequence of the
complexity of the post-translational modifications that comprise ABO(H) antigens and a historical limitation in the
tools needed to study both ABO(H) antigens and the antibodies that develop against them. While a variety of
highly novel tools have begun to revolutionize the field of glycosciences – the study of carbohydrate modifications
– these tools have not been as thoroughly applied to perhaps the most common and arguably most clinically
significant carbohydrate structures within the human population – ABO(H) blood group antigens. Fundamental
questions surrounding anti-ABO(H) antibodies and their target antigens often require disparate areas of
expertise, including glycosciences, immunology, hematology and microbiology, which has directly limited the
study of this foundational discovery in transfusion medicine. To overcome this challenge, we have assembled a
highly collaborative and integrated team of physicians and scientists with expertise in these fields. The combined
collaborative history of the Project leaders (>50 papers and >15 years of collaboration) and the use of newly
developed models and tools specifically designed to define factors that govern anti-ABO(H) antibody
development and the specific ABO(H) targets on RBCs responsible for HTRs. In doing so, this program project
grant (PPG) will provide a unique opportunity to define fundamental features of anti-ABO(H) antibody
development and the ABO(H) targets that result in HTRs that have remained incompletely understood for over
a century. This will be accomplished through 3 distinct Projects and the support of complementary Cores. Project
1: Examining the impact of microbial dynamics on B cells responsible for anti-blood group antibody
formation (Leader: Stowell). Project 2: Convergence of innate immunity and microbial communities in
the regulation of anti-blood group antibody development (Leader: Arthur). Project 3. Defining the distinct
antigen targets and antibody specificities that govern ABO(H) RBC incompatibility (Leader: Cummings).
By leveraging these Projects and Cores, this PPG will answer fundamental questions in transfusion medicine."
10782162,"Summary: In order to answer fundamental questions regarding the factors that govern ABO(H) immunity and
incompatibility, new tools and approaches will need to be leveraged in a highly integrated manner. The need for
a multidisciplinary approach is due to the intrinsic complexity of the questions this proposal seeks to address,
including the complex structural features of ABO(H) post-translational antigens, the unique pathways responsible
for anti-ABO(H) antibody formation that likely differ considerably from more well-studied pathways that dictate
red blood cells (RBC)-induced alloimmunization and the role of innate immune factors and microbial glycans in
shaping anti-ABO(H) antibody levels and specificity. Only through a program project grant (PPG) mechanism
can the unique skills, Projects and Cores be established that are necessary to define fundamental features of
ABO(H) immunity and incompatibility. To accomplish this, and therefore bring the broad range of investigators
and overall expertise together that is necessary to address the key questions outlined in this proposal, an
administrative core will be critical. This Core will not only oversee administrative aspects of the PPG but will also
provide oversight of human subject biospecimen collection, provide a central node for data storage and sharing
and directly coordinate with the existing biostatistical core at Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical
School for data analysis. Given the distinct elements of each study, which range from defining key aspects of
the microbiome, innate and adaptive immune interactions with blood group antigens and the actual ABO(H)
blood group structure targets of incompatibility, coordinating these efforts across all Projects and Cores will be
essential to successfully integrate, compare, and analyze all data. For data integration of human studies, it will
be especially important that these studies use the same biospecimens. To this end, Core A will provide
administrative oversight, oversee the biospecimen repository and facilitate data collection and storage of pre-
clinical and human subject data so that data integration and comparison across all projects can be achieved.
This will be done through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Provide administrative support for the PPG
program. Aim 2: Oversee biospecimen collection and dissemination. Aim 3: Serve as a data repository
for data integration, biostatistical analysis and data sharing with NIH data repositories. In summary, Core
A will serve a critical role for the PPG by providing critical administrative oversight that is traditionally the role of
an administrative core for a PPG program, while also serving as a biospecimen collection center and data
coordinating center for the entire PPG."
10781936,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The hundreds of different bioactive components in the venoms of cone snails have demonstrated
extraordinary biomedical potential in the past, including development as an FDA-approved drug. However,
their discovery and characterization is generally limited by the small amounts of venom that are accessible.
Our laboratory has developed a calcium-imaging platform combined with selective pharmacology
(“Constellation Pharmacology”), that when combined with recent technical advances in transcriptomic and
proteomic analysis and electrophysiology (an integrated platform that we call Pharmaconomics) completely
changes the landscape with respect to discovery and characterization of novel venom components. Using
pharmaconomics, one goal is to tightly couple the discovery and biochemical characterization of individual
venom components with the elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie their biological
activity. The pharmaconomics approach also uncovers how individual components affect physiology at the
system’s and whole animal level. We will use the insights gained from the characterization of bioactive venom
components to rationalize the species-specific behavior and neuroethology of the cone snail and it’s fish prey.
These new tools should allow an unprecedented rate of discovery of novel bioactive cone snail venom
components tightly linked to the elucidation of their molecular targets.
 Although the focus of this project is on venom peptides and their molecular targets, the
pharmaconomics approach can be used for elucidating the physiologically-relevant molecular target of any
natural product. Linking the vast chemical diversity of natural products to their cognate macromolecular
receptors should greatly expand the use of natural products as pharmacological tools in basic research, as well
as their therapeutic and other biomedical applications."

The proposed K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research aims to best enable the Principal
Investigator, Dr. María Marquine, to advance research on neurocognitive disparities in aging and Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) among Hispanics/Latinos/as/x (henceforth Hispanics). Dr. Marquine’s
research program has centered around two major themes: 1) the identification of risk and protective factors for
neurocognitive decline among older Hispanics with and without HIV, and 2) the development of tools for the
accurate identification of neurocognitive impairment among Spanish-speakers in the United States. More
recently, she has extended this latter focus to include the use of ubiquitous mobile technology for the
identification of ADRD risk. Dr. Marquine is passionate about mentoring and supporting the advancement of
early career scientists, particularly those from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. Approximately
80% of her mentees have been from disadvantaged backgrounds, and her mentees have spanned various
career stages, from high-school to early career faculty. She is currently a co-Investigator on two NIA-funded
research education programs, the San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease-Resource Center for Minority Aging Research
(AD-RCMAR) and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Advancing Diversity through Aging Research
(ADAR) program, and Deputy Director of an R25 Research Education Program on aging and HIV. She is also a
mentor in the UCSD Hispanic Center of Excellence, several NIH-funded T32 training programs housed at UCSD,
and the San Diego State University (SDSU)/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology. Attaining a
Midcareer Investigator Award would allow Dr. Marquine protected time to continue advancing her research
program in neurocognitive disparities and ADRD, deepen her commitment to mentor junior clinical scientists in
the conduct of research in this area, and obtain formal training in mentoring and leadership skills. The award
would also provide support for the development of neuropsychological normative standards to detect
neurocognitive impairment associated with ADRDs among older Spanish-speakers, which is a necessary step
toward the advancement of ADRD research in this understudied group. In her research and mentoring activities,
Dr. Marquine will leverage resources available within three major research centers at UCSD, namely, the Stein
Institute for Research on Aging, the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and the HIV
Neurobehavioral Research Program. Together, these research centers have built and maintain a highly effective
research and training infrastructure that will serve as an important resource for Dr. Marquine’s own research
program and that of her mentees."
10878871,"Project Summary
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), a condition where the inner ear cannot convert sound into nerve impulses
to the brain, is the most common congenital disease. The leading cause of non-genetic SNHL is congenital
cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection, and the economic burden of SNHL and its detrimental effect on language
development in the US is estimated at nearly $4 billion annually. Studies show that prompt antiviral therapy
can improve language development in children identified with hearing loss. However, the benefits of early
antiviral treatment are highly dependent on rapid diagnosis. If there are no saliva or urine samples available,
diagnosis of cCMV infection in children is only possible by examining Dried Blood Spots (DBSs) that are
routinely collected at birth. However, current DNA extraction methods exhibit lower sensitivity to detect CMV in
DBSs when compared to saliva and urine. Microgen’s One-Step platform, which integrates sample lysis and
target amplification, is an innovative, low-cost, and user-friendly technology that can address this challenge.
The goal of this project is to develop an inexpensive ($25 each) and rapid (30 min from sample to result) test
for diagnosis of cCMV using DBSs, allowing immediate counseling and treatment. Development of Microgen’s
One-Step CMV DBS test will provide a new tool for diagnosis, especially in asymptomatic patients with delayed
hearing loss."
10922804,"Many adolescents and young adults (AYA, 14-24 years old) in Nigeria have a substantial HIV risk but do not
receive HIV prevention services. While pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HIV self-testing, sexually transmitted
infection (STI) testing, and linkage to AYA-friendly clinical services are essential, they have not been widely
implemented or sustained in Nigeria. This underlines the importance of implementation science to increase the
adoption and maintenance of HIV prevention services for AYA in diverse settings. Our 4 Youth by Youth
(4YBY) program (NICHD UH3HD096929) leveraged participatory implementation strategies like crowdsourcing
open calls and designathons and participatory learning communities to develop AYA-led PrEP uptake, HIV
self-testing, and STI testing services in Nigeria. The success of this NICHD-funded Prevention and Treatment
through a Comprehensive Care Continuum for HIV-affected Adolescents in Resource Constrained Settings
Implementation (PATC3H) pilot program facilitated transition to an NICHD U-supported randomized controlled
trial underway in 32 local government areas. Interim data demonstrates that the 4YBY program is effective, but
how to transition this research study into practice and sustain it overtime for AYA in Nigeria requires further
investigation. As a multi-disciplinary research team with proven track record, we propose the following specific
aims: (1) To use participatory approaches with Nigerian youth (i.e. crowdsourcing designathons and
participatory learning communities) to develop new strategies for sustaining the 4YBY program; (2) To
evaluate the effectiveness of a finalist sustainment strategy to sustain core elements of the 4YBY program
among at-risk, HIV-negative AYA (14-24 years old) in Nigeria using a cluster randomized control trial in 32 new
local areas; (3) To estimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the overall 4YBY program. We define
sustainment based on the continuation of core elements of the 4YBY program at sufficient fidelity, the
continuation of intended benefits, and adequate capacity for the continuation of the program. The Youth
Participatory Action Research framework and the PEN-3 cultural model will inform our study. Implementation
science aspects will be guided by the Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework and the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We will also estimate the cost of implementing and
sustaining the 4YBY program. We are currently implementing 4YBY in 32 local areas among a general
population of AYA for 24 months. Within this cohort, we will integrate the final sustainment strategy and collect
data on sustainment over time. In addition, we will recruit 32 new local areas with higher risk (PrEP-eligible)
AYA that will either receive the same sustainment strategy alongside 4YBY (16 areas) or a standard 4YBY
program (16 areas). Findings from the proposed S-ITEST (Sustaining Innovative Tools to Expand HIV Self-
testing) study will be relevant in other settings. S-ITEST responds to high-priority topics identified by the United
States National Institutes of Health, NICHD, NIMH, FIC, and OBSSR."
11031296,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy, affecting up to 0.5% of the
general population. HCM confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality but remains clinically
underrecognized. Traditionally, the diagnosis of HCM has relied on comprehensive assessment by
echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging, modalities which are not available for screening of the
general population. As novel disease-modifying therapies emerge, there is a need for efficient strategies to
improve HCM screening outside specialized centers. The research proposed in this post-doctoral fellowship will
leverage advanced computational methods and the expanding availability of wearable and portable technologies
to adapt machine learning algorithms for the efficient, point-of-care screening of HCM. In Aim 1, the applicant
proposes to use a large electrocardiographic (ECG) library to adapt ECG signals for use with wearable devices
and fine-tune those signals for the detection of HCM. Noising-denoising algorithms and cross-modal pre-training
with corresponding echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance videos will ensure that the models are
robust to noise and learn key representations of the HCM phenotype, respectively. In Aim 2, single-view, two-
dimensional echocardiographic videos will be extracted, pre-processed, and augmented to simulate point-of-
care image acquisition. Through a self-supervised, contrastive pre-training approach, the applicant will build
data-efficient computational models to screen for HCM based on echocardiographic videos reflecting the quality
and unique challenges seen with point-of-care use. In Aim 3, the applicant proposes a prospective case-control
study of patients with and without HCM, who will undergo point-of-care electrocardiography and
echocardiography, to test the feasibility and real-world performance of a two-stage HCM screening protocol
based on Aims 1 and 2. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in biomedical machine
learning, computer vision, and implementation science. The Yale School of Medicine offers the facilities and
computational resources necessary to accomplish the research goals, whereas the Yale-New Haven Health
electronic health record and well-phenotyped echocardiographic and ECG libraries ensure access to a diverse
and representative population. The proposed period of mentored research will support the applicant’s training in
computer vision, advanced analytics, and medical informatics. The experience, data, and skillset acquired during
this period will further support the applicant in preparing for a successful career in the implementation science of
cardiovascular artificial intelligence technologies."
10748358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than 500,000 patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receive chronic hemodialysis (HD) in the
U.S. each year. The prevalence of ESKD/HD is increasing, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities. There is
a compelling need to address the many clinical concerns that ESKD/HD patients routinely face. One of the most
pressing concerns is poorly managed pain. Pain affects up to 90% of ESKD/HD patients; compromising mood,
functioning, and overall quality of life (QoL). Pharmacotherapy remains the most common approach to
managing pain and substantial numbers of ESKD/HD patients continue to receive long-term opioid treatment.
This approach to managing pain is limited by substantial risks of adverse outcomes, including falls, fractures,
and hospitalization. Novel non-drug therapies are needed to reduce pain and lessen reliance on opioid therapy
in the patient population. Given the increasing prevalence of ESKD/HD in persons of color, it is essential that
studies evaluate rigorously the safety and efficacy of new treatments in minority populations.
 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory therapy, designated as
having minimal risk that can reduce pain and analgesic consumption in patients with diverse types of chronic
pain. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been limited by small sample sizes and stimulation
protocols that are brief (≤10 sessions), have not employed at-home stimulation capability, and have only
assessed for short-term effects, i.e., mostly employed post-intervention follow-ups of 4 weeks or less. To the
best of our knowledge, no tDCS analgesic trial has evaluated longer-term treatment outcomes or determined
whether treatment effects vary as a function of race/ethnicity status.
 Our highly experienced multidisciplinary research team from Weill Cornell Medicine/Cornell University, NY,
the Rogosin Institute, NY, and the Metropolitan Jewish Healthcare System (MJHS) Institute for Innovation in
Palliative Care, NY has pioneered an at-home, remotely supervised tDCS-telehealth approach that enables
long-term stimulation protocols suitable for populations with serious chronic illness such as ESKD/HD. We
propose to conduct an adequately powered RCT (N=100) that ensures enrollment of approximately equal
numbers of Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic whites, with the following aims: 1) determine the
short-term (at 2 weeks and upon conclusion of the 40-session 8-week tDCS protocol) and longer-term (12, 16
and 26 weeks after baseline) effects of at-home tDCS, versus sham stimulation, on pain (primary outcome) and
on analgesic consumption, pain interference, depressed mood, and quality of life (secondary outcomes); 2)
evaluate whether tDCS effects on outcomes vary by race/ethnicity; and 3) ascertain the tolerability of tDCS in
terms of side effects and assess patient satisfaction with device use and study procedures. At-home tDCS is a
highly promising nonpharmacologic treatment for pain in ESKD/HD. Establishing its longer-term effects could
transform the way pain is managed in this ethnically diverse growing population of patients."
10748366,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The dream of open science for genomics is hindered by concerns about genomic data re-identification and the
resulting restrictive data access protocols. The long-term goal is to create a technical ecosystem that can
facilitate more open scientific practices for genomic research. The central motivation is the belief that both equity
and the pace of advancement of genomic science could be increased by easing access to existing genomic
data, including underutilized direct-to-consumer genomic data, through a combination of two technologies:
bringing genomic analysis to participant-stored data and the adoption of sign and mask technology. The rationale
for this project is that these technologies greatly facilitate the recruitment of research participants by creating a
bridge between researchers and potential participants who already possess their own genomic data, signing that
genomic data to re-assure researchers about its provenance and integrity, and masking those portions of the
data that are not required for the analysis at hand from researchers to ensure participant privacy. The central
motivation will be pursued through four specific aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a framework based on bringing
genomic analysis to the data; 2) Design and analyze an offline digital signature system for masked genomic
data; 3) Characterize key aspects of the legal and regulatory context for the genomic data ecosystem; 4) Analyze
the likely acceptance by researchers and usability by participants of new technologies for protecting and sharing
genomic data. The first aim will develop the technologies necessary for carrying out “in-silico” genome tests on
the desktop computers or smartphones of individuals. The second aim will develop the technologies necessary
for individuals to protect sensitive parts of their genomic data while still providing useful integrity assurances to
researchers. The third aim will identify and characterize the significant legal and regulatory challenges that face
an open science approach to genomic research. The fourth aim will use qualitative and quantitative methods to
assess the acceptance, impact, and usability of the technologies developed in studies targeting genomics
researchers and lay users. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it combines technical,
legal, and social scientific methodologies to create a framework for open science in genomics, to characterize
the legal and policy challenges that must be overcome for this framework’s widespread adoption, and to
empirically assess how these technologies can be made most useful for researchers while simultaneously
protecting the rights of research participants. The proposed research is significant because it will facilitate more
rapid advancement for genomic science by providing access to underutilized and more diverse sources of
genomic data, streamline the process of gaining access to potential sources of genomic data while ensuring its
integrity, and provide a new framework within which the security and privacy of genomic data can be increased
for research participants. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to contribute to the adoption of open
science practices in genomic research."

Pemphigus is a broad term denoting a subset of potentially life-threatening autoimmune blistering skin diseases
with a prevalence of 5.2 cases per 100,000 adults in the United States. Several genetic variants strongly increase
PF risk, including variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), such as the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) class I and II genes. The PI has contributed significantly to uncovering susceptibility genetic
variants in PF, including a recent genome-wide association study. Remarkably, variants in genes encoding
natural NK receptors have been strongly associated with PF susceptibility, and some of these associations were
explained by differential expression levels. Despite the compelling evidence for the role of NK cell receptor
variation in this autoimmune blistering skin disease, the precise function of NK cells in mediating pemphigus risk
and outcomes is poorly understood. The overall goal is to develop a comprehensive map of sequence and
structural variation of the entire NK cell receptome in pemphigus, encoded by approximately 90 genes within the
LRC (leukocyte receptor complex) and NKC (natural killer complex). To bring novel insights about the role of NK
cells in disease, we will characterize the nature and extent of the association of genetic variation of NK receptors
achieved via our novel high-throughput, high-resolution next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays and applied
across a set of diverse, established, and well-characterized cohorts. Using state-of-art methods, we will
contextualize this genomic variation by considering NK cell phenotype in disease. Finally, we will explore the
functional implications of the observed NK receptor variation, allowing a mechanistic explanation of the impact
of NK receptor expression to understand better the role of these highly variable receptors in pemphigus and lay
the foundation for understanding disease mechanisms. As we aim to explore and uncover regulatory
mechanisms, our research will significantly expand the comprehension of NK cell biology, cytotoxicity, and
function. Our ultimate goal is to reveal biological processes that lay the foundation for advancing disease
comprehension and treatment by discovering potential targets for NK-cell-mediated immunotherapies."

10754878,"SUMMARY: ADAMTS9 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with thrombospondin 1 motifs, 9), a secreted
metalloproteinase known to regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics, is essential for primary cilium
biogenesis in mice and humans. ADAMTS9 mutations result in nephronophthisis (NPHP), a severe medullary
cystic kidney disease caused by loss pf primary cilia. The mechanism of ADAMTS9 function in kidney
development and renal disease is not known. Utilizing N-terminomics, we have now identified a novel
ADAMTS9 substrate, TMEM67, a key component of the ciliary transition zone. Similar to ADAMTS9,
TMEM67 mutations also cause NPHP. The extracellular domain of TMEM67 is known to play crucial roles in
canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling whilst the coil-coiled domain in the cytoplasmic tail is required for
cilium transition zone assembly. We hypothesize that ADAMTS9-mediated TMEM67 cleavage is essential
for ciliogenesis and hence for the normal development of the mammalian kidney.
 To investigate ADAMTS9-mediated TMEM67 cleavage in kidney development we will conditionally
delete Adamts9 in the murine kidney. To investigate the cellular mechanism downstream of TMEM67
cleavage in ciliogenesis and cell signaling, we will utilize rescue experiments in mammalian cell culture
models. Pilot data show that Adamts9 conditional deletion (cKO) in the murine kidney is viable and cKO mice
manifest renal pathologies. In wildtype RPE-1 cells, the N-terminal extracellular domain fragment of TMEM67
cleaved-off by ADAMTS9 is not cilium localized while the intracellular C-terminus is. The identified novel
cleavage site is 100% conserved in mammals and mutations of the cleavage residues result in cystic kidney
disease in humans. We hypothesize that TMEM67 may be a bi-functional and bi-motif molecule and
ADAMTS9 cleavage segregates these functions by proteolytic processing. The Specific Aims of this
proposal are: 1) To investigate ADAMTS9-mediated TMEM67 cleavage in the murine kidney and 2) To
investigate how TMEM67 cleavage affect ciliogenesis by uncovering the downstream mechanism of action.
Impact: TMEM67 mutations are the leading cause of MKS (Meckel syndrome) worldwide and
understanding its functionality is highly significant to ciliopathy research. Many key ciliary structural
proteins that result in devastating renal ciliopathies are also transmembrane molecules (polycystin1,
polycystin2, fibrocystin, TMEM67, TCTN 1/2, TMEM216.. etc.). They have distinct extracellular domains, and
some are known to be shed by unknown proteases. Here we have identified both the protease and its
substrate, giving us a unique opportunity to perform fundamental experiments and gain deep mechanistic
insight into the intricate relationship of extracellular proteases and ectodomain shedding of ciliary
transmembrane proteins."

The thin filament is a multi-subunit regulatory machine. Proper regulation of cardiac contraction requires
communication among, and controlled movement of, individual thin filament proteins. The goal of this application
is to understand how post-translational modifications (PTMs) and human cardiomyopathy mutations, located at
conserved interfaces between thin filament subunits, affect protein-protein associations, modulate muscle
function, and/or lead to disease. Drosophila melanogaster benefits from robust experimental tools that permit
efficient, yet comprehensive, scrutiny of the most proximal consequences of thin filament perturbations. This
animal model will continue to help us discern the mechanistic basis of contractile regulation and, importantly, of
myopathic responses to molecular insults. Mice, however, are more genetically and physiologically similar to
humans. Using a unique combination of techniques including high-speed video and cryo-electron microscopy,
in silico modeling, and mechanical assays we will define, for the first time, the structural and functional effects of
specific PTMs and cardiomyopathy mutations, located at interfacial seams between thin filament subunits, from
the molecular to the tissue level. Therefore, a highly integrative approach will be employed that relies, in part, on
a pioneering strategy to express human actin variants in Drosophila for purification and biophysical analysis, and
upon several new fly models of actin and troponin T (TnT)-based cardiomyopathies. The latter will be
complemented by murine models. Aim 1 will focus on determining the effects of actin acetylation on tropomyosin
(Tm) positioning and cardiac performance using recombinant human proteins, flies, and mice. We will test the
hypothesis that acetylation of K326 and K328 on actin, residues we previously showed bind to and help orient
Tm such that it prevents actomyosin cycling, discourages inhibitory Tm positioning and promotes cardiac
contraction. For Aim 2 we will delineate how certain actin and TnT cardiomyopathy mutations uniquely affect
myocardial relaxation. We will test the hypothesis that particular actin and TnT lesions disturb distinct, critical
interfacial contacts with Tm, which differentially alters Tm-based inhibition of contraction and force production to
initiate discrete cardiac pathologies. For Aim 3, we will ascertain if the same actin PTMs investigated in Aim 1,
improve or worsen myocardial dysfunction in murine and fly cardiomyopathy models. We will test the hypothesis
that enhanced cardiac contractility, conferred by actin pseudo-acetylation, will improve and aggravate the
pathological phenotypes in models of dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. Overall, this work
is significant since it will provide critical structural and functional information necessary to understand how the
thin filament machine operates normally and during disease. Additionally, our efforts will yield genotype-
phenotype information in a less complex model system (Drosophila) that limits genetic modifiers and
environmental factors to help establish paradigms for disease processes involved in cardiac remodeling."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive diseases characterized by their debilitating
impact on cognitive function. Adults ages 65 years and older represent the majority of cases, and are managing
not only ADRD, but multiple chronic conditions (MCC) that are common with advancing age. Adherence to
prescribed medication regimens is critical to optimize both cognitive and physical health, but is especially difficult
in the context of multidrug regimens. Little is known about how older adults with ADRD self-manage their
medications, how these responsibilities transition to caregivers as the disease progresses, how capable
caregivers are to fulfill these responsibilities, and how ambulatory care practices support patients and caregivers
to ensure safe medication use and adherence. This K01 application seeks to provide training for Dr. Rachel
O’Conor to launch an independent research agenda focused on understanding the cognitive and psychosocial
determinants of chronic disease self-management behaviors and health outcomes for older adults and their
caregivers as they manage complex chronic conditions, including ADRD. To achieve this goal, her short-term
training goals are to: acquire scientific knowledge in ADRD pathophysiology and care, gain exposure to the
clinical management of older adults with ADRD in geriatric and specialty memory clinics, gain experience
conducting research with cognitively impaired individuals and their caregivers, and obtain formal training in
longitudinal data analysis and advanced statistical techniques. The objective of the proposed research is to
examine medication self-management behaviors among a diverse sample of older adults with ADRD + MCC
and their caregivers. Dr. O’Conor will partner with the Northwestern Alzheimer’s Disease Center and an ongoing,
NIA-funded cognitive aging cohort study to conduct complementary mixed methods investigations. The research
aims are to 1) Examine the evolving strategies employed by older adults with ADRD and their caregivers to self-
manage multidrug regimens as the disease progresses over time; 2) Characterize barriers primary care clinicians
face engaging older adults and caregivers in the management of ADRD and MCC; 3) Investigate associations
between cognitive decline and medication self-management behaviors among older adults managing complex
multidrug regimens; 4) Explore factors influencing associations between cognitive decline and medication self-
management behaviors. The proposed investigations will inform the development and evaluation of a primary
care based intervention to support older adults with ADRD + MCC and their caregivers in their medication
management, and serve as the foundation for a unique cohort study to prospectively investigate how older adults
with early stage ADRD + MCC and their caregivers transition medication self-management roles over the disease
course, and its impact on health outcomes."
10755680,"Our long-term goal is to advance the knowledge of the neurobiological and molecular mechanisms underlying
chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) and develop effective pharmacologic treatments. Pain is not only a
life-long companion but also a predictor of mortality for the 100,000 Americans living with SCD, people mainly
of African or Latin descent.1-3 Pain and SCD are so intimately intertwined, that African tribal words for the
disease, spoken hundreds of years before Herrick described SCD in the western literature, are onomatopoeic
for pain. Though it is now appreciated that SCD pain is characterized by chronic pain with episodes of acute
pain,4-5 the neurobiology of chronic pain is poorly studied, not well characterized, and is refractory to currently
available therapies,6-7 a century after Herrick's seminal paper.8 A great deal of research has been carried on
the disease itself.9-10 Several transgenic models of SCD have been developed, including the humanized
Berkeley (BERK)11 and Townes' sickle cell transgenic mice (TOW),12 both representing SCD phenotypes that
closely mimics many features of severe SCD in humans.13-20 We propose to employ these well-characterized
sickle cell transgenic mouse models for studying molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying chronic
pain, which can hold much promise for a more thorough understanding of pain mechanisms in SCD and may
guide development of effective therapies. This R35 program will advance the knowledge of molecular
mechanisms underlying chronic pain in SCD and apply new knowledge to design and examine experimental
therapeutics in mouse models of SCD. The program is designed to have flexibility that expanded or new
research directions can be rapidly taken when new findings or emerging technology become available. Our
research applies the power of molecular and cellular biology, pharmacology, neurobiology, epigenetics,
targeted delivery, and other cutting-edge tools and we have existing research, expertise and research facility
for studying sickle pain problem at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This program will methodologically
investigate chronic pain in SCD using several newly developed innovations and start to fill the void in our
understanding of chronic pain of SCD. Having identified the CaMKIIα target for SC pain and recently moved a
CaMKIIα inhibitor from bench to a Phase I study in patients with SCD, our team is uniquely suited to carry out
research in this R35 program. Our innovation has a high probability of success given our outstanding track
record, vibrant ongoing research program, and the designed flexibility in pursuing new research directions."

The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science
(CDU) in partnership with the Los Angeles Community College District propose the Cultivating Interest in
Research Careers (CIRC) Program. Lack of participation from communities underrepresented in medicine
and science (UIMS) in the scientific research workforce is a critical issue affecting the future of research, and
ultimately our nation’s health. Access to a high-quality science education required for a research career
remains largely determined by socioeconomic class, race/ethnicity, gender and/or national origin. There is a
critical need to motivate and equip lower-income UIMS community college students with the academic skill set
to critically understand, explore and engage in scientific research, as well as the confidence and
communication skill set required for advancement in scientific careers. Early interventions in the undergraduate
education timeline are needed to build a diverse and inclusive scientific workforce. The Program’s main
components include: 1) A Summer Research Experience, where students attend a one-week boot camp to
familiarize themselves with research fundamentals and participate in hands-on research under the supervision
of a research mentor with expertise in one of NHLBI’s research focus areas, and 2) A Pathway to Research
Careers Continuum, where students attend workshops which will enhance their research and academic skills.
Since California Community Colleges are the single largest system of higher education in the country, and with
data showing that 80% of students enrolled in Los Angeles Community College district schools are from UIMS
communities, the proposed CIRC Program will provide important opportunities for UIMS community college
students to receive research training as well as skills necessary to transfer to four-year colleges/universities.
The Program’s overarching goal is to increase the number of UIMS students prepared to pursue careers in the
biomedical and clinical health sciences. To this end, the Specific Aims are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: To engage 14 UIMS community college students each year in a mentored, summer scientific
research experience in basic, clinical, or translational research related to CVD within the NHLBI mission.
Specific Aim 2: To provide 14 UIMS community college students each year with a year-long faculty and “near-
peer” advising program to continue building academic skills as well as provide support in transferring to a four
year college/university to study math or science.
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the effectiveness of the CIRC program for UIMS community college students in
promoting academic advancement, scientific productivity with presentations and/or manuscripts, completion of
an undergraduate degree, and successful application to a graduate program in a science-related field."

Breathing is a vital process that maintains oxygen and carbon dioxide homeostasis, and its dysregulation leads
to various and often devastating conditions. Effective pharmaceutical treatments for patients in respiratory
abnormalities are severely limited due to our lack of knowledge on the neurological mechanisms controlling
breathing and how they may go awry under pathological conditions. Sighs are long, deep breaths with a
bimodal inspiration that occur spontaneously every several minutes to reverse the alveolar collapse
(atelectasis) and maintain normal lung function. Sighing has also been implicated in various pathological
conditions, including sudden infant death syndrome. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand the
neural control of breathing patterns, including sighing, and how it fails in pathological conditions. In this project,
we propose to understand how the central control mechanism of sighing is regulated by physiological sigh-
inducing stimuli, including hypoxia and sleep-wake states. We recently identified that the mouse brainstem
neurons expressing neuromedin B (Nmb) or gastrin releasing peptide (Grp) comprise the core components of
a dedicated sigh control circuit. Leveraging this endogenous pathway and circuit underlying sighing, we will
integrate mouse genetics, optogenetics and chemogenetics, genetic ablation, neural circuit tracing, functional
imaging, and physiological assays, to genetically and functionally dissect the neural control circuits in mouse in
vivo experiments. In Aim 1, we will use optogenetics, genetic ablation, and circuit tracing to define the neural
circuit underlies hypoxia-induced sighing. In Aim 2, we will examine the role of input neurons to the sigh circuit
in regulating sighing as a function of sleep-wake state. In Aim 3, we will monitor the calcium activity of the sigh
control neurons during basal and induced sighs in order to understand the neuronal basis underlying the
generation of sighing and other breathing patterns in physiological conditions. The expected outcomes are to
lead to a better understanding of the function of the sigh control circuits, and provide an improved foundation
for understanding how different breathing patterns are controlled and how physiological states in turn dictate
switches in the breathing patterns. These outcomes will have an important impact by revealing the mechanistic
basis for the pathophysiology of breathing disorders and identifying targeted pharmacological approaches for
new treatment modalities in a variety of clinical scenarios."

The Vanderbilt-Nigeria Building Research Capacity in HIV/Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) (`V-BRCH')
program is a coordinated approach to build the capacity of Nigerian investigators to successfully initiate and
implement high-quality clinical trials in HIV-associated NCDs. V-BRCH builds upon long-standing and highly
successful collaborations between two leading research institutions in Nigeria and the United States - Aminu
Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. V-BRCH will solidify an atmosphere
of continuous mentoring and skills acquisition for AKTH physician faculty in conducting clinical trials in HIV-
associated NCDs via short- and medium- term learning opportunities, paired mentoring arrangements and
mentored research projects (Aim 1). We will select three AKTH faculty members per year to attend the highly
effective annual 1-month long Vanderbilt Institute for Research Development and Ethics (“VIRDE”) faculty
enrichment program in Nashville. We will offer two 2-week, on-site workshops in Nigeria every year for
physicians and research staff on HIV-associated NCD epidemiology, clinical trials methodology, and grant
writing. We will identify research-oriented junior faculty staff (n=8) at AKTH for focused training in key areas of
need and in clinical trials administration and regulatory oversight. Scholars will share best practices and
lessons learned through mentoring panels, regular `Works in Progress' meetings, and monthly career
development seminars. Competitive seed grants will be provided to mentor-mentee teams (n=10) to promote
targeted in-country pilot studies focused on HIV-associated NCDs. For long-term training (Aim 2), we will
support enhanced Master of Public Health (MPH) training at Bayero University/AKTH in Nigeria (total: 8
physicians) and Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) at Vanderbilt for 2 Nigerian physician
scientists. We will build institutional capacity in HIV-associated NCD clinical trials research via short-term
regional courses, staff development workshops and MPH curriculum refinement (Aim 3). To take advantage of
complementary courses, peer-to-peer group learning and research networking opportunities, V-BRCH will
leverage training activities conducted by other FIC-funded training programs in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa
(South-South collaborative opportunities). V-BRCH represents the culmination of years of collaboration in
research and training between Vanderbilt and AKTH and will lay the foundation for sustainable development of
clinical trials research focused on HIV-associated NCDs in Nigeria."
10756978,"Hypoxia and macrophages drive tumor aggressiveness and treatment outcome leading to worse prognosis for
breast cancer patients. Contrary to acute hypoxia where tissue homeostasis is vital for development and repair,
chronic hypoxia observed in solid tumors stimulate unproductive angiogenesis by excessive vascular endothelial
growth factor expression leading to dysfunctional vessels that perpetuate hypoxia and acidic extracellular
pH; factors that limit effective perfusion of treatment modalities like chemotherapies and radiotherapies and
promote tumor aggressiveness. Macrophages are intimately involved in regulating unproductive angiogenesis
thru secretion of soluble factors that support this activity. In the parent grant, we advanced electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR)-based techniques towards in vivo real-time tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling in animal
cancer models. Using these approaches, we showed macrophage hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF)-
1α and HIF-2α had disparate roles in regulating TME parameters like oxygen and pHe through structural and
functional alterations in vessels that dictated docetaxel efficacy. We showed that HIF-1α augments expression
of endothelial tyrosine kinase (TIE2) receptor on macrophages called TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs)
previously-reported to be “pro-angiogenic”, but now better defined as “pro-hypoxic” by dysregulating vessels
leading to poor perfusion. The overall objective of the renewal is to investigate macrophage location and function
that perpetuates a hypoxic TME detrimental to perfusion of therapeutic modalities. To achieve this central
objective, we propose these specific aims: (SA1): To optimize magnetic resonance imaging modalities for
in vivo multifunctional mapping of local tumor tissue parameters. Advances in paramagnetic probes and
imaging technologies such as rapid scan EPR imaging and Overhauser-enhanced MRI allow for mapping
specific areas of hypoxia and acidosis and characterizing their relationship to tumor macrophage locoregional
populations. (SA2): Elucidate tumor macrophage location-specific functions in regulating hypoxia and
acidosis in a mouse model of breast cancer. We will sample tumor origin and regions of hypoxia in PyMT
breast cancer models using image-guided biopsy to understand the bi-directional shaping of TME and
macrophages that contribute to poor vessel perfusion and hypoxia. (SA3): Investigate recruited and tissue-
resident macrophage populations and their respective roles in contributing to tumor hypoxia and
acidosis that dictate chemotherapy effectiveness. We will track fluorescent bone marrow monocytes to tumor
origin, and generate conditional macrophage-deficient breast tumor mice to systematically determine a causal
role of specific macrophage populations. Summarizing, in vivo mapping of tumor hypoxia and acidosis using
innovative magnetic resonance technology in mice deficient in specific macrophage populations or lacking
hypoxia-regulated macrophage functions in a mouse model of breast cancer may provide new insight into a
macrophage/TME axis that suppresses the efficacy of clinically-relevant anti-cancer therapies."
10776264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
DNA cytosine methylation yielding 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a major epigenetic modification involved in the
regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Mammalian DNA methylation is catalyzed by three DNA
methyltransferases (DNMTs), belonging to two structurally and functionally distinct families. DNMT3A and
DNMT3B establish the initial cytosine methylation pattern, whereas DNMT1 maintains that pattern on newly
replicated DNA. Cancer cells exhibit aberrant DNA methylation patterns, including global hypomethylation, which
is associated with low maintenance efficiency, and regional hypermethylation, which is mainly due to abnormal
de novo methylation and/or deficient demethylation. Although the demethylating agents 5-azacytidine and 5-
aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) have been approved by FDA for treating some hematological malignancies,
these nucleoside analogs incorporate into DNA, leading to substantial DNA damage and cellular toxicity, and
are ineffective in treating solid tumors. Recently, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) reported the discovery of a new class
of dicyanopyridine-containing DNMT1-selective inhibitors with therapeutic potential. The long-term goal of this
research is to develop a highly potent and selective non-nucleoside DNMT3A/3B inhibitor for cancer treatment.
The objective of this 2-year exploratory project is to identify one or more promising leads for further development.
The rationale is that remedying hypermethylation by inhibiting DNMT3A/3B would reactivate abnormally silenced
genes, including tumor suppressor genes, and thus provide therapeutic benefits for cancer patients. The
proposal is based on preliminary data, generated in the applicants’ laboratories, showing that some
dicyanopyridine-containing derivatives and quinoline-based derivatives can selectively inhibit DNMT3A/3B. The
applicants propose to perform biochemical and structural studies to improve the potency and selectivity of
DNMT3A/3B inhibitors (Aim 1); and validate the compounds for their potency and selectivity using wild-type and
DNMT-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), determine their anti-cancer effects using cancer cell lines
with or without mutations in components of the DNA methylation and demethylation enzymes (DNMT3A, TET2
and IDH1/2), and assess their cytotoxicity using untransformed cell lines (Aim 2). The potential impact of
identifying non-nucleoside DNMT3A/3B inhibitors is likely to be very substantial.."
10776721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. Trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage implant
(GDI) procedures are potentially curative, but reserved for advanced cases due to the rate of complications and
failure. In the immediate post-operative period, fluid venting is regulated either by ad hoc surgical interventions
devised by the surgeon or by valves that do not perform as expected as much as 16% of the time. This process
leads to inconsistent outcomes, including hypotony, which can exceed 10%. Studies report 5-year failure rates
of 30% and 50% and reoperation rates of 30% and 9% in patients who had trabeculectomy and GDI surgery,
respectively. The majority of surgical failures occur due to fibrotic encapsulation. Complications and surgical
failures burden the healthcare system through non-reimbursed post-operative visits and costly re-operations,
and lead to poor patient outcomes and disease progression. Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery devices were
designed to address these limitations; however, in clinical practice, these devices have greater than 20% rates
of both reoperation and failure, and due to their static design, do not enable optimal intraocular pressure (IOP)
reduction through all phases of the post-operative period. An ideal GDI would (1) reduce operative time and skill
through facile, standardized implantation eliminating the need for ad hoc interventions, (2) prevent post-operative
complications including hypotony and implant migration, and (3) achieve significant, long-term IOP reduction by
modulating fibrosis, thereby, improving visual outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
We describe a novel, highly versatile manufacturing platform capable of fabricating implants with a wide range
of compositions and architectures. This platform will enable rigorous evaluation and understanding of the effects
of implant design and topography on the foreign body and fibrotic responses that undermine GDI efficacy. We
previously manufactured small-lumen, nano-structured stents that were durable, leak-proof, and demonstrated
biocompatibility, patency, and IOP-lowering in rabbit eyes. We hypothesize that rationally designed, nano-
structured GDIs will reduce fibrosis and increase fluid conductivity by providing cues that enable cellular
integration and inhibit pro-fibrotic signaling pathways to suppress scar formation. When combined with a novel
partially degradable shunt design, these properties may eliminate hypotony, reduce complications, and lead to
long-term IOP reduction to significantly improve outcomes for the most vulnerable glaucoma patients."
10796306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Macrophages respond to stimuli in their microenvironments, altering their polarization to M1 pro-
inflammatory or M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Targeting macrophage polarization provides a
promising therapeutic strategy for obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance. C1q/TNF-related
protein 6 (CTRP6), a member of a highly conserved secreted protein family, has recently been found
to be involved in the functional regulation of adipose tissue. In Ctrp6 knockout (KO) mice fed with high-
fat diet, the expression level of M1 macrophage marker gene TNF-a was significantly down-regulated
in white adipose tissue as well as in serum, suggesting the reduced inflammation. In RAW264.7
macrophage cell line, CTRP6 recombinant protein reduced the expression of M2 macrophage marker
gene CD206 at lower doses while induced TNF-a expression at higher doses, indicating its important
role in both suppressing M2 polarization and promoting M1 polarization. Interestingly, CTRP6
recombinant protein can be detected in the nuclear after it was added to the cell culture medium,
indicating it is a secreted nuclear protein. Thus, the objective of the proposal is to confirm knocking out
CTRP6 gene in macrophages polarizes them to anti-inflammatory phenotype and further develop a
cell-based therapy to attenuate adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance via injecting
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CTRP6 KO macrophages. The program will be carried out in three specific
aims: 1) determine the anti-inflammatory phenotype of CTRP6 KO macrophages by performing
transcriptome profiling, functional analysis and metabolic analysis; 2) determine the impact of CTRP6
KO macrophages on adipocyte insulin sensitivity in a co-culture system by assessing glucose uptake,
GLUT4 translocation, insulin and other signaling pathways; 3) develop cell-based therapy using
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CTRP6 KO macrophages to ameliorate insulin resistance by evaluating
adipose tissue inflammation and systemic insulin sensitivity. The proposed research is significant,
because it will not only contribute to a fundamental understanding of macrophage polarization in the
setting of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, but also lay the groundwork for the
development of potential cell therapy for obesity using genetically modified macrophages. In addition,
this proposal will enhance the infrastructure of research and education at Oklahoma State University,
introducing biomedical research to undergraduate students especially underrepresented minority and
female students. This would allow them to experience a broad spectrum of techniques, and acquire
skills such as molecular cloning, cell culture and mouse models, which are widely used in modern
scientific investigations."

The viruses of bacteria and archaea, phage, are touted to be the most abundant organisms on Earth, and a
great deal is known about their molecular biology, structure, and mechanisms of replication. Nevertheless
there remain fundamental unanswered or incompletely answered questions about the population biology,
ecological role, and evolution of these viruses. In this investigation we will address and provide answers to
three of these fundamental questions: 1- What are the ecological, genetic and evolutionary conditions for
lytic (virulent) phage to be maintained in and regulate the densities of bacterial populations? 2- Under
what conditions will selection favor a temperate rather than a purely lytic mode of phage replication and
transmission? 3- Under what conditions will selection by lytic and temperate phage favor the evolution
and maintenance of CRISPR-Cas mediated adaptive immunity, rather than envelope or other constitutive
resistance mechanisms? To address these questions, we will use mathematical and computer simulation
models, the properties of which will be analyzed numerically with parameters estimated in the
experimental systems that will be employed for population dynamic and evolutionary experiments. We
will test the predictions (hypotheses) generated from our analysis of these models in populations of
bacteria and phage maintained in liquid, surface, and semisolid culture. Based on the results of these
experiments, we will modify our models to make them more realistic. The experiments will be done with
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their
lytic and/or temperate phage. In addition to their importance to academic ecology, population and
evolutionary biology, the results of this basic science study may well have practical utility. This
investigation will provide an empirically supported theory that could be used to facilitate the design and
evaluation of programs to use phage for the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and domestic
animals, and to control outbreaks of pathogenic bacteria in crops.

10764820,"Drug use causes the formation of strong cue/reward associations which persist long after cessation of drug-taking and
contribute to the long-term risk of relapse. Breaking these associations is an important goal in the treatment of substance
use disorders. Extinction is a form of learning that inhibits behavioral responses to a learned stimulus. Modulating
extinction processes and consolidating the newly-formed memories has clinical potential to reshape maladaptive behavior
and to prevent relapse. We have recently shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) facilitates extinction learning and
reduces cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking in cocaine self-administering rats. These changes correlate with
altered activity in a network that centers on the infralimbic (IL) cortex. Our preliminary data also show that drug-taking
and reinstatement reduce AMPA-receptor currents at layer 5 IL pyramidal neurons, and that VNS reverses these changes.
Systemic blockade of TrkB receptors for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during extinction abolishes VNS’
effects on cue-induced reinstatement and on glutamatergic transmission in the IL. We hypothesize that extinction training
reverses drug-induced changes in synaptic AMPARs in the IL. Pairing extinction with VNS leads to (additional) BDNF release
which consolidates these changes and reduces reinstatement. In this application we will use a combination of behavioral,
electrophysiological, and celltype-specific morphological analyses to 1) further investigate the time- and circuit-specific
dysfunctional neuroadaptations in the IL that contribute to drug-seeking and relapse, and 2) to determine the mechanisms
through which VNS consolidates extinction memory to reduce relapse. Experiments in Aim 1 will use patch-clamp
electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation of afferents from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the IL to determine
how these inputs are altered by drug-seeking, extinction, and VNS. We will perform voltage-clamp recordings from 2 types
of IL projection neurons (to the BLA and Nucleus accumbens shell) and determine VNS-induced changes in postsynaptic
glutamate receptor function and presynaptic release during extinction and reinstatement. These experiments will be
supported with morphological analyses in the same type of IL projection neurons to determine VNS-induced changes
specifically in cells that were activated by reinstatement (labeled by the activity marker pCREB) to test our hypothesis that
VNS preferentially modulates networks relevant in behaviors paired with VNS. In Aim 2 we will determine whether the
VNS-induced consolidation of extinction depends on endogenous BDNF levels in the IL or its inputs. To this end we will
use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock down BDNF produced either from cells within the IL or from cells in the hippocampus that
project to the IL, respectively, in order to determine how VNS-evoked BDNF modulates extinction and reinstatement.
Experiments in Aim 3 will determine the importance of VNS-induced BDNF release to changes in synaptic plasticity and
morphology in cells that regulate relapse. We will also record in-vivo local field potentials in the BLA and the NACshell to
determine how BDNF knockdown affects VNS’ ability to modulate synaptic plasticity in the outputs of the IL. Taken
together, our studies will provide important novel information about cocaine- and extinction-induced synaptic changes in
the IL, and they will identify glutamatergic and BDNF-dependent mechanisms through which VNS can reduce relapse."

International and South African guidelines recommend TB preventive therapy (TPT) for people with HIV (PWH)
and other people at high risk for TB, including close contacts of people with TB. Despite the evidence for reduced
morbidity and mortality for people with HIV (PWH) who receive TPT, and guidelines recommending use, there
remains a substantial gap between people recommended to receive and people who actually receive and
complete a course of TPT. The 2022 WHO Global TB Report highlighted the growing gap in access and provision
of TPT, which has been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridging this gap is a South African and global
priority. With the recent availability and evidence for newer, shorter regimens of TPT, a transformation of HIV
care delivery models (in part forced by the COVID-19 pandemic) and evolving national guidelines for TPT, it is
increasingly urgent to explore new patient-friendly models of TPT delivery in order to inform programmatic
guidance that results in greater uptake, adherence, and completion of TPT. HIV care has benefited from the
expansion of “differentiated care delivery” models, which encourage community-delivered care, infrequent
clinic/facility visits, limited laboratory monitoring, and task-shifted treatment models to deliver comprehensive
HIV care to stable adults in community settings. Emerging demonstration projects have found that HIV preventive
medication, or PrEP, can be safely and effectively delivered by pharmacists rather than clinicians. These
successful models for differentiated HIV treatment and prevention delivery may be able to be translated to include
TB preventive therapy. The availability of safe, effective, short-course TB preventive therapy with limited
monitoring requirements suggests that similar community-based models may be adapted to provide this similarly
essential preventive treatment.
We will explore two approaches of adapting HIV differentiated services to TB prevention. We hypothesize that
people who receive community-delivered TPT have higher rates of completion of a course of TPT than people
who receive standard-of-care clinic-based TPT. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of community vs.
clinic-based TPT delivery among people participating in a community-based TB screening program in South
Africa, and explore participant reasons for completion and noncompletion with qualitative research. We will also
conduct preliminary research on the feasibility and acceptability of task-shifted TPT delivery, engaging clinic-
based pharmacy assistants to provide TPT to low-risk clients. Through formative research, qualitative interviews
with nurses, clinic operational managers, and workflow mapping exercises, we will identify barriers and
facilitators for pharmacy assistant task-shifted TPT delivery. Together, this research will establish the foundation
for subsequent larger trials of patient-centered, differentiated TPT delivery approaches to increase TPT uptake
and completion in South Africa and ultimately decrease morbidity and mortality from TB."

Continuous monitoring of neonatal brain development is crucial for effective management of brain injury and
associated complications, thus reducing healthcare burden and costs. One rapidly developing method for early
characterization of abnormal brain development is to map resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) across
distinct regions of the brain. However, currently available neuroimaging technologies are either expensive and
difficult to use continuously (fMRI and PET) or lack the combination of temporal-spatial resolution and large field-
of-view (FOV) to image distributed rs-FC (EEG and near-infrared spectroscopy and tomography). In collaboration
with University of Kentucky inventors, Bioptics Technology is developing, validating, and commercializing a
revolutionary time-resolved laser speckle contrast imaging (TR-LSCI) technology that enables noncontact, fast,
high-resolution imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) over a large FOV. TR-LSCI illuminates picosecond-pulsed,
widefield, coherent, near-infrared light onto the brain and synchronizes a newly developed, picosecond-gated,
high-resolution, single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera for 2D mapping of cerebral blood flow (CBF) at
different depths into the head. By applying the time-gated strategy, TR-LSCI differentiates short and long photon
paths through the layered head tissues at different depths, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming complex
3D reconstruction in near-infrared diffuse optical tomography technologies. In preliminary studies, continuous
mapping of CBF at different depths has been demonstrated by a lab-made benchtop TR-LSCI prototype in flow-
simulating phantoms and in vivo rodents. In this Fast Track STTR proposal through two phases, we will develop,
optimize, validate, and commercialize a user-friendly portable TR-LSCI device for fast, high-solution, and
multiscale imaging of CBF and rs-FC in neonatal rodents (Phase 1) and neonatal piglets (Phase 2). Specifically,
Phase 1 will optimize and assess the benchtop TR-LSCI prototype for imaging CBF and extracting rs-FC (derived
from time-course CBF images) in neonatal rodents with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
Neonatal rats are used in this Phase 1 feasibility test to de-risk the TR-LSCI before its full-scale development in
neonatal piglets during Phase 2. HIE is selected to study as it affects 2-9 babies per 1000 term births and is
associated with severe neurodevelopmental problems and mortality. Phase 2 will develop, optimize, and assess
a user-friendly portable TR-LSCI device for continuous imaging of CBF and rs-FC in neonatal piglets with HIE.
Neonatal piglets are selected to study as their head size and post-HIE pathology are analogous to human
neonates. TR-LSCI results will be correlated with MRI results and clinical outcomes to identify biomarkers for
assessing neonatal brain injury after HIE. While this proposal tests it on HIE models of neonatal rats and piglets
as the first step for preclinical commercialization, the TR-LSCI device is broadly applicable to investigate many
neurovascular diseases beyond HIE occurring in human neonates, thereby providing a significant opportunity
for future clinical development and commercialization."
10770980,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Lower Extremity Bypass Graft With Physiologic Longitudinal Pre-Stretch
Despite years of improvements and refinements in technologies and pharmacological adjuncts, failure rates
remain high for lower extremity prosthetic grafts, particularly when grafts cross the knee joint. Though much work
has been done focusing on pathological processes associated with infrainguinal synthetic graft failure, the
underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The main artery of the lower extremity, the
femoropopliteal artery (FPA), demonstrates significantly different structural features and mechanical properties
compared to other arteries. The specialized arrangement of its extracellular matrix components creates
longitudinal tension, also known as longitudinal pre-stretch (LPS). In young arteries that are pre-stretched in situ
like a rubber band under tension, LPS prevents arterial buckling during limb movement, but in older FPAs, LPS
is significantly reduced, which results in more severe bending, kinking, high intramural stresses, and disturbed
flow in the bent limb, promoting deleterious cellular and biochemical responses that may culminate in both
primary disease development and reconstruction failure. While reduced LPS in PAD patients likely cannot be
restored, it can be engineered into bypass grafts used to treat them. We have developed a method of
manufacturing nanofibrillar elastomeric bypass (NEB) graft fabrics with nonlinear compliance that can be tuned
to match that of blood vessels. By electrospinning biomedical grade elastomers, we made fabrics that can
produce low resistance to physiological deformations while protecting the material from overstretching at
elevated loads. Our preliminary data using a swine model demonstrate that the NEB graft fabric maintains its
compliance, undergoes rapid endothelialization, and gets quickly incorporated into the arterial wall. In this
application, we propose to decouple longitudinal and circumferential compliances of our material to fully mimic
the complexity of human FPA biomechanics, and test the hypothesis that FPA-tuned NEB grafts with LPS
produce less tortuosity, improved hemodynamics, and better in vivo healing responses compared with
grafts without LPS. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims, whereby we will first optimize
the manufacturing method and develop an empirical framework for making compliant anisotropic grafts. Second,
we will develop NEB grafts tuned to healthy human FPAs and test them for their mechanical properties, suture
retention, water permeability, burst strength, cytotoxicity, platelet adhesion characteristics, implantability,
biomechanics, and flow characteristics using in silico and in vitro methods. Lastly, we will test the performance
of pre-stretched and non-pre-stretched NEB grafts in a preclinical swine model. This project will demonstrate
whether incorporating LPS into lower extremity bypass grafts to reduce bending and tortuosity of the graft during
limb flexion improves hemodynamics, healing, and patency. This novel mechanical adjustment to synthetic
bypass grafts could lead to more durable reconstructions for PAD patients with claudication and critical limb
ischemia, improving limb function and reducing reinterventions."
10796804,"Project Summary/Abstract
The 68Ga-P16-093 radiopharmaceutical is an investigational agent that targets prostate specific membrane
antigen (PSMA), which is highly expressed in most prostate cancers. PSMA-PET has not been validated as a
tool for guiding surgical resection of primary prostate cancer.
The objective of this Phase II Clinical Trial is to critically test the ability of 68Ga-P16-093 PET to identify extra-
prostatic extension of prostate cancer, to guide surgical resection, and to improve the patient’s post-surgical
quality-of-life. For prostate cancer patients who require prostatectomy, we hypothesize that PSMA-PET
findings will accurately differentiate patients who can safely undergo nerve-sparing and/or muscle-sparing
surgery from those in whom more aggressive wide resection is essential for cancer control; thus, optimizing
quality-of-life outcomes. Therefore, the project has two complementary yet independent Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To measure the accuracy of both 68Ga-P16-093 PET-CT, and conventional standard-of-care
 mpMRI, for presurgical detection of extra-prostatic extension.
Aim 2. To measure treatment modifications, and patient quality-of-life outcomes, that result from 68Ga-
 P16-093 -PET incorporation into surgical planning.
The innovations of this project are the application of this imaging technology in pre-surgical treatment
planning for newly diagnosed disease; the definitive assessment of agent performance in a surgical randomized
controlled trial; and the detailed assessments of imaging impact on both surgical planning and subsequent
patient clinical outcome. As a control group, one-half of the enrolled subjects will receive their standard-of-care
prostatectomy with surgical planning supported only by multiparametric MRI and biopsy findings. The other
half of the subjects will be randomized to also receive pre-surgical pelvic imaging with 68Ga-P16-093 PET/CT
for independent assessment of the location and extent of disease. The radiology MRI and PET readers will be
blinded to the findings of the other modality. The surgeon will receive reports on all imaging, but must
document a standard-of-care surgical plan before receiving the PET findings. The surgeon will then document
whether, and how, the PET information modifies their prior surgical plan. For validation of imaging findings,
whole mount pathology will serve as the “gold standard” for characterization of disease. Patient outcome
measures, and cancer recurrence, will be tracked for 18-months following surgery. Our preliminary studies
indicate 68Ga-P16-093 PET-CT will show higher accuracy than mpMRI for detection of extra-prostatic
extension. And, that the PET-directed surgical modifications will frequently result in appropriate preservation
of nerves and muscle, thereby improving post-treatment quality-of-life for many patients, while also helping to
avoid positive surgical margins."
10796809,"Growing evidence suggests that cancer cells undergo significant metabolic alterations during metastasis. Recent
studies show that functional mitochondria are essential for the tumor cell development. However, we largely do
not know how mitochondrial factors contribute to metastatic progression. To identify a novel mitochondrial factor
critical for cancer metastasis, we performed an unbiased RNAi-based screen using a customized RNAi library
targeting 120 mitochondrial enzymes. Screen using various types of cancer cells reveled that aminoadipate-
semialdehyde synthase (AASS) in the saccharopine pathway is a common critical factor for the invasion. In vitro
and in vivo study using AASS variants demonstrated that the activity of AASS is required for cancer cell invasion
and metastasis. Targeting each of the enzymes in the saccharopine pathway revealed 2-aminoadipate (2-AAA),
a metabolic intermediate, as a key factor for cell invasion. Metabolic, genomic, and transcriptomics approaches
were made to gain mechanistic insight into AASS in cancer metastasis. Through a series of metabolic assays,
we found that AASS promotes invasion by managing redox homeostasis in lung and head/neck cancers.
Genomic profiling and GSEA showed that AASS loss results in decrease of peroxisomal genes and a redox
protein TXNDC5. Moreover, spliced form of XBP1, an activated transcription factor of TXNDC5, was reduced in
cells that lack AASS, suggesting a potential link among AASS, sXBP1, and TXNDC5. In addition, through a
kinase inhibitor profiling and comprehensive transcription factor profiling, we identified upstream regulators of
AASS. In particular, we found HGF/c-MET as a kinase and an activator of AASS, and SATB1 as a potential
transcription factor of AASS. Furthermore, our preliminary data showed that AASS upregulation positively
correlates with metastatic progression in tumor tissues from cancer patients, suggesting AASS as a promising
prognostic marker and a therapeutic target to treat metastatic cancers. Therefore, we screened and identified a
US FDA approved compound tannic acid as a potent AASS inhibitor and an anti-metastasis agent.
 Our central hypothesis is that AASS and its metabolic intermediate 2-AAA provide metastastic signals
through their potential regulators and effectors in cancer cells. Thus, AASS signaling represents a promising
anti-metastasis target in human cancers. We will use lung cancer and head and neck cancer as a research
platform to validate AASS signaling as a common metastasis driver. Three specific aims are proposed: (1) To
decipher the molecular mechanism underlying AASS-XBP1 activation, which manages redox signaling and
confers metastatic potential in human cancer; (2) To determine how AASS is activated and induced by HGF/c-
MET and SATB1 to mediate metastasis; (3) To validate AASS as a therapeutic target in treatment of metastatic
cancers using the novel AASS inhibitor tannic acid."
10796814,"Project Summary
 Our efforts to delineate the biochemical processes that convert a transient experience to a persistent
memory led to the discovery that functional aggregation of a Drosophila RNA-binding protein Orb2A is critical for
the animals’ ability to form and retain a memory. During the previous grant period, in our effort to decipher
regulation of Orb2A aggregation, we discovered that the expression of Orb2A protein in the adult brain is
controlled via a unique mechanism. The fully transcribed and polyadenylated Orb2A transcripts retain an intron
and are stably expressed in the fly brain. The intron-retained Orb2A mRNA does not code for a protein, owing
to multiple in frame stop codons. However, behavioral training that produces long-term but not short-term
memory transiently increases the spliced protein-coding mRNA level. This splicing event, important for long-term
memory, is mediated by a specific isoform of the splicing regulator Pasilla, psL.
 Intron retention (IR), a poorly studied form of alternative splicing, was thought to modulate gene
expression primarily by degrading the mRNA, trapping it in the nucleus and thereby reducing protein expression.
Our findings suggest that IR can be used in a novel way: to hold mRNA in a ‘poised state’, which can allow
spatial and temporal integration of various signals to acutely increase protein expression to regulate memory.
 These observations led us to ask how prevalent IR is in the adult Drosophila brain, and what is the
molecular basis of IR in the brain and how experience interacts with the intron-retention mechanisms to control
protein expression and memory. We have performed poly(A) RNA-sequencing from wild type fly brains. The
analysis provided some surprising results. First, 8.9% of all detectable introns, corresponding to 3031 genes,
show ≥ 25% retention in wildtype fly brain. These includes 55 genes with role in learning and memory. A recent
genome-wide study revealed ~6% of fully transcribed and polyadenylated transcripts in the mouse brain also
retains an intron. Remarkably, the mouse orthologues of some the Drosophila genes, including Orb2 orthologue
CPEB2, also retains intron. Second, like Orb2, aggregate-prone prion-like proteins are significantly
overrepresented in the intron retained genes. This includes a novel prion-like phosphatase we have recently
identified. From adult brain, we have identified proteins that bind to a retained intron and interacts with psL. In
the current proposal we intend to investigate how memory-related stimuli activate p38a, a putative kinase of psL,
how behavioral stimuli effect psL interaction with its binding partners, what sequence motifs in a retained motif
influence intron retention, how intron retention controls expression of aggregate-prone proteins and how
perturbation of each of these processes effects animals ability to form and retain memory. These studies would
provide insight into the IR-mediated control of protein expression, a novel gene regulatory mechanism, as well
as the molecular basis of memory and the regulation of aggregate-prone proteins."
10770991,"The ability to sense the world though physical contact is essential for all living organisms. In vertebrates, transient
touch and vibration are detected by Pacinian corpuscles, but the mechanism of their function is poorly
understood. Pacinian corpuscles are innervated by rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptor afferents, which detect
touch due to expression of mechanically activated ion channels. The mechanoreceptor is surrounded by inner
core cells, which are thought to provide auxiliary non-sensory support for the mechanoreceptor. Here, we will
functionally test the hypothesis that inner core cells of Pacinian corpuscles are active touch sensors. We seek
to reveal the molecular mechanism of touch sensitivity and touch-evoked excitability in inner core cells, and
determine the effect of inner core cell activation on mechanoreceptor function. To do this, we will use bill skin of
tactile specialist ducks, which contains a high density of Pacinian corpuscles accessible for electrophysiological
manipulations. Because Pacinian corpuscles are present in the skin or internal organs of most vertebrates,
including all mammals, our results will further our understanding of general molecular and cellular mechanisms
of touch detection."
10930970,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), is the most prevalent chromosomal
abnormality and a leading cause of intellectual and developmental disability. T21 affects the development and/or
function of nearly every organ system, predisposing individuals with DS to many co-occurring conditions such
as Alzheimer’s disease, congenital heart defects, and autoimmune disorders, among others. Although it is
accepted that T21 causes genome-wide dysregulation of gene expression programs, little is known about how
T21 affects gene expression across different tissues and organs, and how these effects contribute to the etiology
of the co-occurring conditions of DS. Therefore, there is a clear need to understand the complex cause-effect
relationships between T21, altered gene expression, and organ development and pathophysiology.
Several mouse models of DS recapitulate key phenotypes of DS and have been used to study gene expression
dysregulation in DS. Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) systems have been employed to study the
effects of T21 in human cell types. Therefore, in clear response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-
22-247, we propose here to generate a Trisomy 21 Model Atlas of tissue-specific murine and human
transcriptomes, matched to detailed metrics of organ development and architecture. The use of mouse
models will provide insights into tissue- and developmental stage-specific transcriptome changes and
pathophysiology, while human cell types differentiated from iPSCs will dissect cell-intrinsic features of T21 and
validate findings from the mouse models. Our Specific Aims are:
1. Generate an atlas of gene expression programs affected by trisomy 21 across model systems.
Supported by strong preliminary data, we propose here to complete an atlas of transcriptome changes in ten
organs across three developmental stages in mice and matched data from human cell types derived from iPSCs.
2. Define the impact of trisomy 21 on organ development and pathophysiology at the cellular level. To
investigate the link between dysregulated gene expression and tissue dysfunction, we will assess organ
development and pathophysiology through histopathological profiling, multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging,
single-cell RNA-sequencing, and characterization of human organoids derived from iPSCs.
3. Curate, organize, and share all data for open access through the INCLUDE Data Hub. We will ensure
that all data is made publicly available in the INCLUDE Data Hub by completing careful file curation and
organization, developing a metadata schema, and creating a code repository. This will ensure that the atlas
becomes a lasting resource that can be used beyond the scope of this grant.
Altogether, this resource will advance our understanding of the effects of T21 on organ development and
pathology, while enabling findings cross-validated in mouse models and human cell types."
10768286,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in human genomics are transforming the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. However,
there are too few clinical geneticists and genetic counselors to meet rising demand, and non-geneticist
clinicians feel under-prepared to incorporate genetics into medical practice. To further explore this gap, we
conducted a needs assessment study with UCSF clinicians to identify unmet educational needs. Our results
indicate that providers (including clinical faculty, staff and trainees) need more training in order to confidently
use genetics and genomics in their practice, particularly in the types and utility of genetic tests, interpretation
and communication of results, direct-to-consumer genetic testing, ethical issues and informed consent. These
results reinforce the need to produce more genomically-literate physicians. To help meet this need, we plan to
develop a one-year Master of Science (MS) program in Genomic Medicine for UCSF medical students. A survey
of our medical students in all four years has identified substantial interest in such a program, foreshadowing
success in recruiting an exceptional cadre of budding physicians to this program. Enrolled students will
participate in the MS program after completing their clinical clerkships. Educational strategies will incorporate
innovative modalities that accentuate active learning, emphasize clinical applications of genetics and genomics,
and promote cognitive integration. Courses will be taught through a combination of synchronous and
asynchronous approaches. Course content will include foundational principles of human and molecular
genetics; genomic technologies, informatics and variant interpretation; specialty-specific content including
cancer genomics, reproductive genetics, neurogenetics, genetics of cardiovascular disease and psychiatric
disorders; genomics laboratory processes; clinical-translational research methods and interpretation of
literature; ethical, legal and social implications and policies; and a comprehensive exam assessing ability to
apply genomics to clinical practice. A team of faculty with extensive expertise in genetics and genomics will
collaborate to develop and teach the content. Courses will be evaluated by students, and feedback will guide
course and program continual improvement. Student competency will be assessed using a combination of
quizzes and exams with multiple-choice and open-ended questions and clinical simulations. Our commitment
to diversity and inclusion will be reflected in our student recruitment, including significant outreach to our
substantial number of URM medical students; our faculty and learning environment, including Lantinx and
African American faculty and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) training for all faculty; and our curriculum
content. Our program will be disseminated through presentations at medical education meetings (including
APHMG, ACMG, IAMSE, WGEA, and AAMC), sharing course curricula with other medical schools (e.g.,
APHMG Genetics Education Resource Exchange), and publishing specific educational materials (e.g.,
MedEdPORTAL)."
10769250,"Project Summary/Abstract
The human genome contains more than 1,600 transcription factor-coding genes. Transcription factors (TFs)
play essential roles in gene regulation and are relevant to all aspects of human biology, from development to
disease mechanisms. Defining the activity and function of TFs is vital to understanding gene expression, and
the most informative assay for TF activity is the genome-wide identification of loci where a TF interacts with
DNA. These loci are classically measured by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
high-throughput sequencing) or variants such as CETCh-seq (CRISPR epitope-tagged ChIP-seq). As
members of the ENCODE Consortium, the Myers/Mendenhall group generated 1,203 ChIP-/CETCh-seq maps
for 676 human TFs, and nine other groups produced a combined 742 maps for 463 additional TFs. However,
~700 human TFs still lack genome-wide binding maps. This proposal aims to expand this data resource,
producing binding maps for 600 more human TFs using an established production pipeline that can begin
immediately. The first goal is to complete 200 binding maps in the HepG2 cell line, thus generating data for the
vast majority of TFs expressed in this cell line. This resource will be powerful for many analyses, representing
a near-complete overview of all active TFs in this cell type. The second goal is to generate binding maps for
400 human TFs with no ChIP data and do so in the cell types that express the TFs. Over sixty percent of these
TFs will be assayed in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neuronal precursor cells (NPCs), or neuronal
cells differentiated from these, and the remaining TFs in a variety of other cell lines. These cells have been
used successfully in the pipeline and have other important genome-wide assay data, including ATAC-seq,
RNA-seq, various histone modification ChIP-seq experiments, and 3D connectivity data. The resource
produced will represent a greatly expanded database of DNA binding maps for most human TFs; these
experiments have long been a goal for biology and will enable many analyses to comprehensively define the
grammar of TF gene regulation."
10770369,"Abstract. Despite the declining prevalence of smoking in the US, lung cancer continues to be the leading cause
of cancer deaths. Treatment of lung cancer with PD-1 blockade has become first line therapy of most non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, given the variable effectiveness of immunotherapy in this disease there is
a need to better understand factors that affect individual’s response to this therapy. The lung microbiota plays
an important role in host immune responses affecting subject’s susceptibility to inflammatory airway diseases.
We have demonstrated that lower airway microbiota is associated with Th17 phenotype in the lower airways. In
lung cancer, we identified a dysbiotic signature in the lower airways called pneumotypeSPT that is associated with
transcriptomic signatures associated with lung carcinogenesis. Our preliminary data shows that subjects with
lower airway microbiota characterized as pneumotypeSPT may have increased mortality and increased immune
checkpoint inhibited tone. While gut microbiota signatures are partially associated with PD-1 blockade response,
the effects of the lower airway microbiota on the immune tone and PD-1 blockade susceptibility are not known.
Thus, we hypothesize that lower airway dysbiosis (pneumotypeSPT) alters the host inflammatory
phenotype in the tumor microenvironment affecting the response to PD-1 blockade. To study this, we will
utilize a scientifically rigorous approach to conduct this pathophysiological investigation using prospective
airway, stool, and blood samples collected before and after PD-1 blockade treatment of subjects with advanced
NSCLC. We will evaluate airway/stool microbial signatures associated subjects’ response to PD-1 blockade by
longitudinal assessment of the progression free survival (Aim 1). In addition, we will perform longitudinal
sampling of airways, stool, and blood to expand our mechanistic understanding of the dynamic changes in the
microbiome and host immune response during PD-1 blockade treatment (Aim 2). Validation and extension of
the assessment of the microbiome and host inflammatory profile will be accomplished by using complementary
approaches (microbiota: 16S rRNA gene and metatranscriptome sequencing; inflammation: airway brush
transcriptome, polychromatic flow cytometry, and single cell RNA sequencing of T cells). In Aim 3 we will use a
preclinical mouse model of lung cancer that will allow us to evaluate the effects of dysbiosis on the lower airway
immune tone and PD-1 blockade susceptibility. Identification of microbial signatures that affect the response to
this first line therapy will be key to a personalized therapeutic approach and will identify novel modifiable targets.
Lay summary. The treatment of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., has been
revolutionized by the use of immunotherapy. However, the response to this therapy is variable and recent data
suggest that microbes that colonize our bodies (called microbiome) can affect subject individual’s response. In
this project, we will uncover microbial signatures that affect the lung cancer treatment response to
immunotherapy."

“Mechanisms of DNA helicases and their regulation”
Helicases are a ubiquitous and diverse group of molecular machines that separate the strands of nucleic acids.
They are essential actors in many genome maintenance processes in all domains of life, including some viruses.
As a result, helicases are biomedically important proteins, and their pathologies are associated with a number
of human diseases and cancer. Since uncontrolled unwinding is detrimental to genomic integrity, helicase activity
must be tightly regulated in the cell. Furthermore, since many helicases are able to play multiple, distinct roles
in a variety of cellular pathways, they must be activated only in the correct contexts. How these different functions
are defined and regulated remains poorly understood.
 In this project, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which DNA helicases are regulated. Our
studies will focus on the model non-hexameric helicases UvrD, Rep, and XPD, which are critical components of
the cellular response to DNA damage in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea and also serve as prototypical
members of the two largest structural superfamilies of helicases. Insights gained on their mechanisms are
expected to extend to a number of structurally and functionally homologous systems.
 Prior work by us and others has shown that these types of helicases have auxiliary domains and/or make
secondary contacts with DNA that play regulatory—often, auto-inhibitory—roles. Protein partners to helicases
have thus been proposed to activate helicase activity by controlling these mechanisms, thus defining helicase
roles in the cell. To gain insights into these mechanisms, our studies will focus on two main research goals:
understanding how interactions with DNA and non-canonical DNA structures control helicase activity (Goal 1),
and quantifying how encounters with accessory proteins—both protein partners that recruit and activate
helicases and proteins that compete for the same DNA substrates—regulate helicases (Goal 2).
 Our approach for achieving these research goals will integrate advanced single-molecule biophysical
techniques—optical tweezers combined with fluorescence microscopy—together with traditional biochemistry
and computational biophysics methods. These approaches leverage our group's expertise and that of the
assembled collaborators, and have been successfully applied by us in our high-resolution measurements of
helicase unwinding and conformational dynamics, their modulation by interactions with accessory proteins, and
their connection to atomic-level structural models of helicases,. Beyond providing insights on helicase
mechanism and the genome maintenance pathways in which they participate, our studies will advance new
biophysical methods for investigating biomolecular dynamics."

Cancer represents a collection of diseases that remains the second leading cause of death in the United States.
However, several recent advances in cross-disciplinary research have improved patient outcomes and provided
a tremendous opportunity for continued progress. In order to further the innovation and clinical impact of research
discoveries, a Ph.D. workforce with broad conceptual knowledge across the field of cancer biology research is
required. To ensure successful careers, Ph.D. scientists need an acute awareness of rapidly evolving
technological approaches used in cancer biology research, deep knowledge of specific areas, and critical
thinking skills. To address the need for well-trained, diverse, cross-disciplinary Ph.D. scientists entering the
workforce, we propose the Graduate Program in Cancer Biology Training at Emory University. This Program
will provide an exceptional interdisciplinary training program that is above and beyond Ph.D. programs at Emory
with opportunities for basic and translational research focused on cancer biology. It will be highly integrated
within the environment at the Winship Cancer Institute, the NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. A
suite of evidence-based learning approaches, experienced research mentors focused on cancer in various Ph.D.
Programs and unique ability to interact across clinical and laboratory disciplines will enable the development of
our trainees' success in academic-, industry- and government-based research careers. The objective of this
Program is to provide a diverse population of predoctoral students with effective training that culminates in 1)
Ph.D. scientists with broad conceptual knowledge who are trained to think critically, effectively, and communicate
their findings; 2) A Ph.D. workforce aware of how to conduct responsible, rigorous and reproducible scientific
studies; and 3) A Ph.D. workforce with training in cross-disciplinary communication and exposure to clinical
application of research findings. To achieve this goal, we will use a core curriculum that includes discussion-
based, active learning approaches to fundamental principles of cancer biology and the development of
presentation skills through didactic classroom and seminar experiences. The importance of rigor and
reproducibility in cancer research is emphasized during all phases of the training for both students and mentors,
with a required course emphasizing this training as part of the courses, seminars, and journal clubs. This program
will have an environment focused on inclusive excellence to ensure the recruitment and retention of students
from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. Finally, Ph.D. trainees will have unique training opportunities,
including the responsibility to organize and execute symposiums, seminars, rigorous training in ethical aspects
of research, and ample opportunity for close interaction with clinical and research trainees undergoing post-
doctoral fellowship training to invigorate communication-related to translational relevance in cancer."
10782163,"SUMMARY: Naturally occurring anti-ABO(H) antibodies represent the most common barrier to transfusion and
transplantation. These antibodies can vary wildly in titer and specificity, resulting in distinct clinical outcomes
following ABO(H) incompatibility. Formation of these antibodies is linked directly to host interaction with specific
microbial strains that express blood group positive carbohydrate antigens. The overarching goal of Core B is to
provide tools for assessment of the role of microbial populations in driving and shaping naturally occurring anti-
blood group antibody responses and their clinical consequences. To this end we will provide microbial
microarrays for the high throughput analysis of both innate and adaptive immune interactions with a wide array
of microbial glycans. Our recent discoveries that innate and adaptive immune factors interact with a variety of
distinct microbial glycans using a platform populated with microbial glycans isolated and printed in a microarray
format have already demonstrated the utility of this approach in elucidating key host-microbe interactions. These
results recapitulate actual interactions with intact microbes. As microbial communities are numerous and diverse,
our preliminary data also importantly demonstrate that specific microbes expressing blood group antigen can be
specifically isolated from a complex microbial mixture and that microbial glycans from these microbes can be
similarly isolated, printed and interrogated for host immune factor interactions, allowing a triage approach for
printing of relevant microbes. While these preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach,
most microbes that express blood group antigens are not yet represented on currently formats. As a result, to
provide the breadth of microbial coverage needed to effectively assess host microbial interactions related to
development of anti-ABO(H) antibodies and therefore directly facilitate the studies outlined in each Project of the
program project grant (PPG) program, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Continue to generate
validated microarrays populated with blood group positive and negative intact microbes and their corresponding
microbial glycans. In this aim we will continue to make existing microbial microarray platforms available to each
Project, through the continued printing of these platforms that contain previously isolated blood group positive
and negative microbes. Each array platform will be validated prior to use to facilitate reproducibility and data
comparison across the entire PPG. Aim 2: Culture, characterize and isolate glycans from newly identified blood
group positive and negative microbes for incorporation into expanded microbial array platforms. In this aim we
will expand existing microbial microarrays by incorporating microbial glycans and corresponding intact microbes
isolated by the various Projects throughout the course of the proposed studies into array platforms. The
production and validation of these key microbial microarray tools will consolidate the effective use of crucial
resources and expertise, eliminating effort overlap among the PPG sites and allowing for effective analysis of
samples and data comparison across the PPG."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) remains a critical public health crisis in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Centers of
Excellence have been charged with providing opioid treatment, including medication for opioid use disorder
(MOUD), to enhance treatment access, promote recovery, and reduce the impact of fatal overdose throughout
the state. Despite efforts to improve access to evidence-based treatments for OUD such as medications and
integrated behavioral health services, national OUD and opioid involved overdose death rates remain
alarmingly high. Current MOUD interventions primarily targeting reduction in OUD symptoms have significant
dropout rates (20-50%) and result in remission of OUD for ~36 percent of individuals. The patients with co-
occurring substance use and mental health disorders are at greater risk for poor outcomes, often because they
have more complex treatment needs that are hard to identify, track, and respond to in real time. To potentially
improve OUD intervention outcomes, the overarching goal of the HEALing Measures Center at University of
Pittsburgh is to enhance the measurement, quality, and equity of care delivered in community opioid treatment
programs (OTPs) through sustained implementation of measurement-based care (MBC). Specifically, the
three proposed projects were designed to address the immediate concerns expressed by our partners
while simultaneously meeting critical research gaps. Research Plan 1 will develop an MBC
Implementation Blueprint including technical assistance, learning networks, and paperwork reduction
strategies. Research Plan 2 will demonstrate the fidelity and effectiveness of implementing enhanced MBC
implementation (MBC+) versus measurement as usual (MAU) via a stepped-wedge, hybrid type II
effectiveness-implementation trial. Research Plan 3 will demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of MBC+
relative to MAU for patients with co-occurring OUD and mental health diagnoses. The proposed study will
provide critical preliminary evidence regarding the role and significance of capitalizing on MBC in OUD
interventions, enhanced implementation of a sustainable, equitable, and effective MBC intervention via
implementation strategies that are co-designed with stakeholders (policymaker, payer, and OTP), and
alternative avenues to potentially enhance symptom-related outcomes and treatment retention of OUD
interventions with downstream societal, psychological, and public health benefits."

Background: As of 2020, an estimated 654.1 million adults live with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and women who
are post-menopausal are nearly twice as likely to develop KOA compared to men. Despite this, most animal
studies on KOA include only males, and, of the few studies utilizing females, menopause is typically not included,
as it is not a naturally occurring process in non-primates. As such, there is a paucity of literature aimed at
understanding mechanisms of menopause associated KOA and a corresponding absence of treatment
interventions specifically for post-menopausal people with KOA. As a part of my PhD work thus far, I have
developed a chemically-induced menopause model by injecting middle-aged female mice with 4-
vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD). I have confirmed this model displays a menopausal phenotype, including
perimenopause, and that these mice display more severe KOA than age-matched, non-menopausal mice.
The research goals of this fellowship are to interrogate mechanisms of menopause-induced KOA using
our VCD model (Specific Aim 1) and employ synthetic biology techniques to lay the groundwork for new
treatment modalities for menopause-indued KOA and (Specific Aim 2).
Specific Aim 1: A component of E3 ubiquitin ligase was recently identified in a GWAS meta-analysis as a unique
contributor to OA in women. As such, I will interrogate the role of estradiol-regulated, ubiquitin proteolysis in
mediating menopause-induced KOA using our VCD menopause model. Changes in ubiquitin proteolysis
signaling across perimenopause, menopause, and with estradiol treatment will be quantified both in vivo and in
vitro. We hypothesize that (1) menopause induction will disrupt ubiquitin proteolysis activity and (2)
estradiol treatment started early in menopause will restore ubiquitin proteolysis signaling and ultimately
quinch menopausal KOA.
Specific Aim 2: I will design an estradiol-regulated controls circuit to modulate a gene of interest (GOI) in vitro.
A significant drop in estradiol is a principal physiological change associated with menopause, and an estradiol-
repressed promoter will be designed to turn the circuit on. GOI candidates will be generated from previous
studies and will be systematically tested to determine ideality for mediating chondrogenicity. We hypothesize
that a genetic controls circuit modulated by estradiol will attenuate chondrocyte health in vitro.
Impact: To support my fellowship, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in KOA, menopause,
aging, and synthetic biology. I have strategized with my mentoring team to design a rigorous training plan that
will take advantage of the extraordinary research environments offered at my sponsor’s new institution
(Spaulding Rehabilitation, Harvard Medical School) and the University of Pittsburgh, where I remain a full-time
student. This fellowship will propel me towards my long-term goals of being a physician-scientist who practices
orthopedic surgery and research leader in joint diseases and injuries presenting in women."

Compared to either disorder alone, co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) has a more complex clinical and treatment course that imposes significant health burden on veterans.
Identifying novel mechanisms to improve integrated AUD/PTSD treatment outcomes is a public health priority
that aligns with NIAAA’s strategic goal to advance treatment of alcohol-related conditions through the refinement
of behavioral and pharmacological treatments. Self-compassion is a cognitive skill that may facilitate more
effective integrated AUD/PTSD treatment. Self-compassion is proposed to function by tapping into an innate
care-giving system that could interact with oxytocin’s prosocial effects such as feelings of safety and trust. The
current study will leverage an ongoing NIAAA-sponsored clinical trial that is examining the efficacy of oxytocin
compared to placebo to improve outcomes in an integrated behavioral treatment among veterans with
AUD/PTSD. The primary goal of the proposed study is to examine the bivariate longitudinal associations between
self-compassion and treatment outcomes. The secondary goal is to examine whether veterans higher in self-
compassion and administered oxytocin will outperform veterans in the placebo condition. Finally, we will utilize
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture the associations between self-compassion, alcohol
consumption and problem severity, and PTSD symptoms in a real-world context. We hypothesize that self-
compassion will enable more adaptive responding to AUD and PTSD symptoms (e.g., managing craving, lapses,
maladaptive thinking patterns) thereby promoting a more efficient treatment course and reducing susceptibility
to risky alcohol use or relapse. This is an important and feasible project that will provide novel insights into the
role of self-compassion in AUD recovery among veterans with co-occurring PTSD. This project will also provide
critical training experiences necessary to facilitate the candidate’s long-term goal to be an independent alcohol
researcher. Under the proposed award, the candidate will have the opportunity to 1) master the extant literature
on behavioral and pharmacological interventions for AUD/PTSD; 2) acquire new skills in the design and
implementation of clinical trials; 3) hone skills in naturalistic assessment methods such as EMA; 4) advance
longitudinal data analytic capabilities; and 5) increase scholarly productivity through grant and manuscript
development. She will accomplish these deliberately selected training goals by leading the proposed research
project, engaging in a comprehensive mentorship plan with highly skilled sponsors, and participating in a
carefully selected program of didactic training opportunities. The training will be carried out at the Medical
University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Addiction Sciences Division. MUSC is a renowned academic medical
center known for its innovative and excellence in alcohol research. Thus, the candidate will have access to an
institution and sponsors with a strong history and commitment to clinical alcohol research."

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) affects a large number of older adults (~50% of adults aged 75+), yet not all
individuals are equally impacted. Understanding why some older adults struggle more with ARHL is an
important first step in designing more effective treatment plans. This proposal explores the hypothesis that
individual differences in the use of contextual vs. acoustic-phonetic cues explains variation in speech
comprehension abilities beyond just hearing ability. Natural listening environments contain a variety of cues
that listeners can rely on to aid in speech comprehension. Despite the availability of many cues, recent work
with healthy younger adults and older adults (including pilot work for this proposal) has demonstrated that
some individuals tend to rely more on higher-level contextual information and others rely more on lower-level
acoustic-phonetic information to interpret ambiguities in speech. The goal of this project is to test the
hypothesis that these individual patterns of cue use will explain differences in speech comprehension (Aim 1)
and to examine at what point in processing these individual differences arise using neural data collected from
electroencephalography (EEG; Aim 2). One two-session experiment will be run testing younger and older
adults on an audiometry battery, a cognitive battery, a cue use task in which they listen to sentences that
contain ambiguous words, and a passive storybook listening task. EEG will be recorded during the cue use
task and the storybook listening. While controlling for hearing and cognitive abilities, the contribution of an
individual’s cue use will be tested in a model predicting speech comprehension (Aim 1). Neural data will then
be analyzed to test three potential mechanisms that could lead to behavioral differences in cue use: (1)
differences in early perceptual encoding of ambiguities in speech, (2) differences in later repair processes, and
(3) differences in overall predictive mechanisms. A combination of event-related potential (ERP) and temporal
response function (TRF) analyses will be performed to identify the locus of individual differences. Overall, this
proposal provides important insight into different profiles of ARHL, and insights from neural data will highlight
where in processing differences arise, potentially serving as a basis for designing effective treatments.
Additionally, studying patterns of cue use may potentially reveal individuals whose ARHL may initially go
undetected (those who tend to rely more on contextual cues). This proposal will prepare the applicant to lead
an independent line of work examining the neurobiology of speech comprehension from an individual
differences lens. Specifically, this proposal will give the applicant opportunities to engage with clinicians,
expand individual differences work in cue use into older adults, and gain expertise in multiple computationally
intensive analysis methods of EEG data."
10748339,"A novel gut microbial pathway has been clinically and mechanistically linked to cardiovascular
disease (CVD) via generation of phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), a compound we show to
modulate adrenergic receptor signaling. PAGln is the product of a meta-organismal pathway
that begins with gut microbial catabolism of dietary phenylalanine into phenylacetic acid
followed by conjugation of glutamine by the host liver enzymes. PAGln is just one of a dozen
possible microbial metabolites derived from aromatic amino acids. Using untargeted and
targeted metabolomics, we have identified multiple gut-microbe metabolites derived from
phenylalanine and tyrosine in clinical study samples that are associated (or not) with incident
CVD risk. The overall goals of this application are to define gut microbial pathways of aromatic
amino acid metabolism that impact host CVD. This is a critical initial step for improved
understanding of gut microbiota contributions to CVD, and in the development of therapeutic
strategies to leverage this information. In Aim 1 we will identify specific gut microbial metabolites
derived from aromatic amino acids that can impact CVD phenotypes. In Aim 2, by combining
microbial transplantation studies using genetically engineered human commensals (gain and
loss of function mutants), we will test causal contribution of defined microbial enzymes to
specific candidate metabolites linked to CVD."
10987733,"Early Childhood Caries, along with obesity, are the most prevalent health disparities of childhood in the west.
Both are closely associated with maternal feeding behaviors and cognitions. Educational and behavioral
interventions—most directed at individual mothers—have shown disappointing results in recent decades,
showing limited impact on child health and nutrition. Social-contextual features of the environment--community,
neighborhood and household—are known to profoundly impact child feeding and other risk/protection
behaviors. Working with low income immigrant families at high risk of child caries and obesity, this application
will develop a neighbor-based social network intervention designed to reduce oral caries and obesity by
modifying the social context in which child feeding and oral hygiene behaviors are embedded.
 MAP (“Mothers Action Project”) for Child Health—is a 12-month group intervention designed to
decrease the risk of early childhood caries and other nutrition-related disease, among South Asian (SA) toddler
and preschool (TP) children aged 1-5. Research from our team and others finds low income immigrant SA
mothers to be highly vulnerable to influences from the social sphere which increase risks to child health. Many
experience social pressure from elders in their social networks to feed TP children a diet heavy in milk, milk
additives, sweets, and refined carbohydrates— all of which adversely impact oral and metabolic health.
Accordingly, MAP-CH is a novel strategy to modify mothers’ social environment by creating new, health
promoting social networks. During the UH3 Phase of the project, 48 clusters of mothers living in close physical
proximity (12 per cluster, 576 total) will be randomized 1:1 into intervention and control arms. Controls will
receive health and parenting education materials. The intervention group will participate in a 12-month, group-
based “Mothers’ Club.” Led by a skilled peer facilitator, each mothers’ club will receive an intervention
designed to: 1) build close social ties, social support, and a sense of group identity among group members; 2)
improve knowledge, attitudes and parenting skills related to feeding. The goal is to transform each ‘Mothers’
Club” club into a meaningful—and lasting-- social network that will support healthy behaviors at least 12
months beyond the end of the intervention. Network formation and social processes will be monitored in the
pilot phase and throughout the trial using a network diagnostics framework to assess social integration and
network cohesion. MAP-CH is the first child oral health intervention using a social network approach."

We will study the role of serine threonine kinases Partitioning defective (Par) 1a and 1b in
adaptive and maladaptive repair following tubular injury. In studies by our laboratory of the
developing kidney, dual loss of Par1a and 1b impaired Notch activation: this demonstrated for
the first time a link between Par1 and Notch signaling. We hypothesize: Par1a/b kinases are
activated in proliferating progenitor cells by kidney injury and regulate Jag1-Notch dependent
and independent pro-fibrotic pathways. Using inducible cell specific deletion of both Par1a/b in
mice, we will test effect of Par1a/b on Notch activation and progenitor cells following injury. We
will investigate the mechanisms underlying the novel Par1-Notch link. Our specific aims are: 1)
Show that Par1a/b regulates the response to kidney tubule injury via the Notch pathway; and 2)
Demonstrate that Par1a/b in tubular progenitor cells promotes maladaptive repair."

 The major aim of this project is to develop and validate a norm referenced test of grammatical
development that can be used in English. This tool will target 4-8;11 year old Spanish-, and Vietnamese -
speaking ELLs with and without developmental language disorder (DLD). This will be directly useful for two
of the largest groups of ELLs in the US. It will be also useful for children who speak languages related to
Spanish or Vietnamese. We will achieve this aim by 1) evaluating current item-level data to guide
development; 2) piloting an item set to include in item tryout; 3) conducting an item tryout study to establish an
item set for testing morphosyntactic performance in ELLs; and 4) field testing and validating a set of
morphosyntactic items for to differentiate among ELLs with DLD at different levels of language exposure/use.
We will recruit 1,050 ELLs (525 per language pair) in the target age range from representative U.S. bilingual
populations both in regard to language and SES. Children will complete a battery of index measures in their
home language and English to identify DLD. They will complete testing in English on the proposed index
measure targeting grammatical knowledge. This work furthers our research in DLD, especially with bilingual
children. We will document a broad profile of language skills in two groups of ELLs whose first languages have
distinct linguistic features (Vietnamese & Spanish) with and without DLD. The tool developed will
transformative for the majority of SLPs who speak only English and will allow for timely identification and
remediation of DLD in ELLs. It will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's expected
performance relative to English exposure in developmental and intervention studies. The proposed work builds
on recent significant gains we have made in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with DLD
through the identification of clinical markers of DLD. Yet, there continues to be significant health disparities
associated with identification and treatment of DLD in bilingual populations. There is a critical need to develop
tools that can be used with ELLs from other language backgrounds. We know that experiential factors (age of
acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. We also know from the published
literature that there are some differences in English language acquisition associated with the typology of the
learner's first language, but we do not have normative data to inform diagnostic decisions about children from
language backgrounds other than Spanish. Currently, the most accurate clinical decisions need to be made on
the basis of 2 languages. The proposed project will extend the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of
DLD from Spanish-speaking ELLs to examine markers of DLD in Vietnamese-speaking ELLs in the US
context."

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection affects more than 38 million people worldwide and
remains incurable due to the early establishment of reservoirs where the virus remains latent. HIV-1 enters the
brain within the first two weeks of infection, and neurologic symptoms have been observed with accompanying
central nervous system (CNS) biomarkers in acute HIV disease. The seven billion microglial cells in the CNS are
the primary cell type infected by HIV in the adult human brain, and in the central nervous system represents a
large potential reservoir site. Additionally, the brain is one of the organs with the highest burden of HIV-associated
disease. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects 20-50% of people with HIV (PWH), with the
milder forms of HAND predominating in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Importantly, intact HIV
proviruses persist in the brain despite viral suppression with cART. Despite this, little is known about the unique
regulatory mechanisms governing HIV activation and latency in the brain. According to our recent cell studies in
human postmortem brain, inflammation-associated reprogramming of microglial transcriptomes and 3D
genomes (chromosomal conformations) is a key factor linked to viral infection and integration in brain cells during
advanced stages of infection associated with encephalitis. However, non-encephalitic infected human brain,
other than showing transcriptomic signatures indicative for disrupted interactions of microglia with the neuronal
synapse, provides little information about the epigenomic and other determinants governing viral activation and
latency in the brain. Here, as a first step towards understanding molecular mechanisms governing HIV latency
in the humanized mouse brain, we will explore an extremely innovative molecular toolbox differentiating, on the
single cell level, infected microglia and other myeloid cells actively expressing HIV, and separating them from
infected cells not expressing HIV (latent). We will use this toolbox for advanced experimental approaches to
quantitatively test molecular, epigenetic, and pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing the reservoir of
humanized HIV+ brain, spleen, and blood. We will employ a novel genetic approach called enhanced HIV-
induced lineage tracing (E-HILT) to reveal the frequency and kinetics of the establishment of latency in the CNS
at the single cell resolution. We will define, in cell culture, and in humanized mouse brain and spleen/blood at
single cell level resolution, the proportional representation of productively infected versus latently infected
microglia and lymphocytes and other peripheral myeloid cells subject to genetically or pharmacologically induced
disruption of chromatin-bound silencers, including the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH)/CTIP2-
KAP1/KMT1E/SETDB1 repressive histone methyltransferase complex and more, broadly, histone H3-lysine 9
methylation (H3K9me)-associated repressive chromatin remodeling. The study will uncover the degree of latency
in primary microglial cells in vivo, explore the transcriptome, epigenomic and chromatic 3D architecture that
supports latency and explore the effects of chromatin modulating drugs on these cell states."

Obesity is a major public health concern associated with several co-morbidities, such as metabolic syndrome,
type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Many prescription medications, including second-generation
antipsychotics (SGAs), increase obesity risk by causing significant weight gain. Our lab studies the widely
prescribed SGA, risperidone, and has shown that weight gain associated with this drug is mediated by the gut
microbiome. Bacteriophages, or phages, are highly abundant in the gut and are important mediators of the gut
microbial community composition. Thus, we investigated how risperidone treatment influences phages in the gut
and found that risperidone treatment leads to the release of phages from bacterial genomes; these phages are
sufficient to drive weight gain and shifts in microbiome composition, and they also have an increased potential
to influence their bacterial hosts’ metabolic state compared to control phages.
While we know that phages are important contributors to risperidone-induced weight gain (RIWG), we have yet
to determine mechanistically how these phages are induced by the presence of risperidone. Temperate phages
are often induced through activation of the bacterial SOS response, leading to the hypothesis that risperidone is
acting as a bacterial stressor that induces the SOS response in gut bacteria, ultimately leading to the release of
phages from the bacterial genomes. This hypothesis will be investigated in Aim 1.
One bacterial species that we found to release phages in response to risperidone is Limosilactobacillus reuteri.
Further, bioinformatics analysis revealed that L. reuteri is significantly depleted in risperidone-treated animals,
suggesting that it may be an important contributor to a lean phenotype. Co-treatment of mice with risperidone
and L. reuteri prevented RIWG and generated a microbiome distinct from that of control animals. Additionally,
reutericyclin (Rtc), a specialized metabolite produced by some strains of L. reuteri, was sufficient to deflect
RIWG, suggesting that L. reuteri deflects RIWG through the release of Rtc. Rtc has known antimicrobial
properties and, like risperidone, is a small molecular xenobiotic leading to the hypothesis that Rtc deflects RIWG
by differentially altering the phageome. This hypothesis will be investigated in Aim 2.
The overall goal of this project is to understand how the presence of xenobiotics can catalyze alterations
in the phageome and determine how these alterations can contribute to changes in energy flux. This work
will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at the Medical
College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the
proposed aims. We have designed a training plan that will be beneficial for my scientific and professional growth
and ultimately will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. Altogether,
this project is fundamental for my advancement as an autistic woman in biomedical research, the field of obesity
research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for xenobiotic-induced weight gain."

Mesenchymal nephron progenitor cells (MNPs) give rise to all nephron tubules in the mammalian kidney.
Premature depletion of these cells leads to low nephron numbers, increasing the risk of high blood pressure
and various renal diseases. In order to intervene in premature depletion of MNPs, we must better understand
how the MNP population is maintained during development. To date, the processes required for the
maintenance of MNPs in vivo are poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest that Hedgehog signaling
plays important roles in MNP maintenance. Hedgehog signaling regulates numerous developmental
processes. Upon binding of Hedgehog to Patched, Smoothened (Smo) is relieved from Patched-mediated
inhibition, initiating the signaling cascade. To test the potential role of Hedgehog signaling in MNPs, we
generated Smo mutant kidneys with Six2Cre and found that MNPs lacking Smo were prematurely depleted
during development, resulting in a 50% reduction in nephron number. Our transcriptional profiling data from
Smo loss- and gain-of-function mutant MNPs show a linear correlation between Ptch1 expression and Smo
dosage, suggesting that MNPs do respond to Hedgehog signaling. Our data show that Fox transcription factors
are downstream targets of Hedgehog signaling in MNPs and that loss of Hedgehog signaling results in the
activation of Notch signaling, a major differentiation signal for MNPs. Based on our findings, we hypothesize
that ligand-dependent Hedgehog signaling maintains MNPs by repressing Notch signal and activating Fox
genes. We propose to (1) perform genetic analyses to determine if Hedgehog signaling increases self-renewal
of MNPs and nephron endowment, (2) test if genetic attenuation or pharmacological inhibition of Notch
signaling rescues premature depletion of Smo mutant MNPs, and (3) test if loss of Fox transcription factors
results in premature depletion of MNPs and lower nephron numbers. Successful completion of these aims will
(1) provide novel insights into how Hedgehog signaling impacts nephron endowment, (2) identify direct target
genes operating downstream of Hedgehog signaling in MNPs, (3) determine if Fox transcription factors play
key roles in nephrogenesis, and (4) improve in vitro renal organoid cultures."

Adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have chronic deficits in cognitive-communication and these impairments
have been linked to negative outcomes and poor community reintegration and independence. A significant
challenge in the field is that commonly used methods to detect these deficits in clinical and research settings
lack the required sensitivity and have focused on a limited subset of discourse tasks that do not reliably predict
communication outcomes. At the heart of our proposal is the idea that current theories of cognitive-
communication are too narrow and the methods used to detect deficits are too limiting. In contrast to current
conceptualizations which state that cognitive-communication deficits affect discourse and conversation (leaving
basic sentence level processing intact), we propose that cognitive-communication impairment is a deficit in the
flexible use and processing of language that manifests across the varied and dynamic contexts of everyday
language use, whether processing a single sentence or participating in a multiparty conversation. For example,
individuals with TBI make inappropriate or irrelevant comments, suggesting a failure to consider the
communicative setting and the perspective of their conversational partners, as well as insensitivity to
contextual cues (environmental, partner) that guide language use. These are problems using and
processing language in context. From this perspective, there is a striking disconnect in the field between
clinical observations of impairments in using language in context and the widespread use of decontextualized
tasks and measures to capture these deficits in the lab and clinic (e.g., monologue discourse task). Using
ecologically valid language tasks and methods sensitive enough to detect even subtle, though meaningful,
disruptions in language, the proposed work endeavors to show that deficits in contextual language processing
in TBI extend even to the rapid processing of individual phrases and sentences in the moment (i.e., online
processing), can be captured in controlled settings, and that such deficits predict communicative outcome. The
proposed program of research represents a novel direction in the study of TBI with substantial basic science
and clinical translational significance. The proposal is organized around three AIMS: (1) To investigate
language processing in context in TBI; (2) To investigate language use in group settings in TBI; (3) To
determine the relationship between language processing in context and communicative outcome. This
proposal is unique in the field and uniquely promising for understanding the nature of deficits in contextual
language processing following TBI and, ultimately, improving rehabilitation intervention outcomes."

Women with severe obesity have high risks of adverse birth and child outcomes, including childhood obesity.
There is a profound need to reduce risks among women who enter pregnancy with severe obesity as part of
prenatal care, but there is scant evidence on appropriate Gestational Weight Gain (GWG) goals in women with
severe obesity. Moreover, severe pre-pregnancy maternal obesity, adverse birth outcomes, and child obesity
are most prevalent in low-income and racial/ethnic minority groups, who are vastly under-represented in
obstetric and pediatric obesity research.
The proposed research addresses the critical problem that GWG guidelines are likely too high for women with
severe obesity, placing children at high risk for obesity and exacerbating disparities in childhood obesity. The
overall objective of this study is to determine overall and trimester-specific GWG associated with the lowest
risk of adverse birth and longer-term outcomes in children of mothers with severe pre-pregnancy obesity. This
study leverages the ADVANCE Early Life Cohort, a unique cohort of low-income, racially and ethnically diverse
mothers and children, constructed from electronic health record (EHR) data from U.S. community health
centers. In contrast with most other EHR-based studies, this study population includes predominately publicly
insured and uninsured patients.
The proposed research will examine >37,000 mothers in ADVANCE living in 3 states (OR, CA, MA), and their
children to conduct 3 specific aims. Aim 1: Determine overall and trimester-specific GWG associated with the
lowest risk of adverse birth outcomes (small or large for gestational age, preterm birth, birth weight) in children
of mothers with severe pre-pregnancy obesity. Hypothesis: Among children of mothers with severe pre-
pregnancy obesity, birth outcomes are optimized when total and trimester-specific GWG are below current
recommendations. Aim 2: Determine overall and trimester-specific GWG associated with the lowest risk of
longer-term obesity-related outcomes (infant growth, BMI at 5 years of age) in children of mothers with severe
pre-pregnancy obesity. Hypothesis: Among children of mothers with severe pre-pregnancy obesity, early
indicators in child obesity risk are reduced with total and trimester-specific GWG below current
recommendations. Aim 3: Determine the extent to which overall and trimester-specific GWG mediate the
relationship between race/ethnicity and BMI at 5 years of age. Hypothesis: A substantial share (>10%) of
previously observed racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity is attributable to GWG, identifying a key point
for intervention. Study findings will inform clinical practice and GWG guidelines tailored to women with severe
pre-pregnancy obesity, both needed to reduce risk in women who enter pregnancy with severe obesity. This
study occurs in the context of a well-established collaborative research environment in the developmental
origins of disease at Oregon Health & Science University and EHR data infrastructure at OCHIN."

 Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that controls blood phosphate levels by
increasing renal phosphate excretion and reducing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production. FGF23 levels
increase with kidney disease and are a strong independent risk factor for adverse renal outcomes and
mortality. However, fundamental understanding of what regulates FGF23 production is lacking.
 We performed a metabolomic/proteomic screen for renal mediators of FGF23 synthesis and have
identified a novel signaling axis whereby kidney derived glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) is converted to
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in bone, which then stimulates FGF23 synthesis. This proposal focuses on this
novel role for LPA, with the central hypothesis that LPA mediated signaling through the LPA receptor 1
(LPAR1) is critical for FGF23 production in acute kidney injury (AKI). Supported by strong preliminary data, we
will use Lpar1 knockout mice to dissect this pathway in response to both exogenous LPA administration (Aim
1) and in experimental AKI (Aim 2). Together, these studies seek to establish LPA and LPAR1 as potential
therapeutic targets for FGF23 mediated morbidity and mortality in kidney disease, and to serve as a
springboard for an independent scientific career at the intersection of nephrology and metabolism.
 The candidate, Dr. Simic, is dedicated to a career in basic investigation in nephrology. She previously
pursued research training in aging and bone biology, but since completing nephrology fellowship in 2018, has
shifted her focus to a new area—kidney disease, metabolism, and FGF23 homeostasis. Dr. Simic’s immediate
career goals include acquiring the skills described in this grant proposal and publishing first author manuscripts
to gain name recognition and to establish herself in academic nephrology. Dr. Simic’s long-term career goal is
to become an independent physician-scientist and a leading expert in kidney-bone interactions and mineral
metabolism. She will benefit from complementary mentorship from Eugene Rhee (primary mentor; Chief, MGH
Adult Nephrology), an expert in kidney metabolism, and Harald Jueppner (co-mentor, Chief, MGH Pediatric
Nephrology), a leader in mineral biology. Dr. Simic’s career development plan will capitalize on the training
and scientific resources in the MGH Nephrology Division and Endocrine Unit, as well as Harvard Medical
School. Drs. Simic, Rhee and Jueppner will meet frequently to discuss both science and career development,
and have clearly identified aspects of the research proposed that will form the basis of her independent career.
An advisory committee has been formed to evaluate progress, provide additional guidance, and plan future
directions. Dr. Simic will present her data regularly both in the MGH Nephrology Division and Endocrine Unit
and will be supported to present her work at national meetings. Formal coursework is planned in grant writing,
public speaking, responsible conduct of research, bioinformatics, metabolomics, and drug development to
further enhance her probability of success as an independent physician/scientist."

The Malawi HIV Implementation Research Training Program (M-HIRST) introduced the developing discipline
of Implementation Science(IS) to Malawi through its collaborative program between the University of Malawi
College of Medicine (CoM) and University of North Carolina. Over the past 4 years, we have established a core
group of Implementation Scientists (8 faculty, 3 PhD, 7 Master’s, 14 mentored grant awardees) providing a
platform to launch new IS research, establish an IS thematic area within the CoM department of Public health
and Family Medicine, and embed IS training into the recently launched Master’s in Global Health Implementation
and the Research Support Centre. However, due to continued evolution of the Malawi HIV program, the need
for implementation scientists has outpaced our development of faculty.
For our renewal, all research will be guided by an annual scientific priorities workshops to ensure our goals are
aligned with Ministry of Health Guidelines and the Malawi National Health Research Agenda. Key areas identified
in the 2018 workshop included implementation strategies to achieve 90/90/90 targets, advanced HIV care,
integration of NCD services in HIV care, and Integrated prevention strategies (VMMC, PrEP). Based on 2019
feedback, differentiated ART care and TB preventive therapy have emerged as priority topics. All planned
training activities complement existing capacity building programs at our institutions to maximize impact.
We will train additional faculty at CoM while expanding to include faculty at the Kamuzu College of Nursing
(KCN). Our goals are to support an additional 4 PhD and 6 Master’s candidates, and engage 12 junior faculty at
CoM, KCN, Ministry of Health and research partners through structured leadership training, career development
grant writing, and protected research time. Our IS internship program will partner with PEPFAR implementing
partners to place 12 trainees in mentored research environments to gain practical experience. Our iterative short
course program is designed to train both new course faculty and trainees and will include advanced IS topics
including mHealth, Economic Evaluation of Health Programs, Quality Improvement, Spatial Modeling for Health
impact, and career development grant writing. Trainees participating in any part of our program can apply for
mentored grants (up to 15 grants) to support their research.
By the end of the award, we expect to have independently funded Malawian investigators capable of
multidisciplinary research to lead the Malawi HIV treatment and prevention implementation science agenda and
mentor the next generation of research scientists."

Experiencing the death of a loved one is inevitable, and grief is a natural response. Most older adults are resilient
and recover their pre-loss functioning within one year. However, in a significant minority, acute grief (AG)
becomes unusually protracted, intense, and debilitating, resulting in complicated or prolonged grief (CG), a
unique and recognizable condition. The public health consequences of CG are enormous, and include negative
medical, cognitive, and cognitive health outcomes, and an increased risk of suicide. Despite the magnitude of
this problem, we cannot distinguish those who are resilient and will successfully transition to integrated grief
within one year from those who are prone to CG trajectories. Neurobiological markers that can characterize the
clinical course for those experiencing AG following a major loss are critically needed. Such biomarkers that
would, in the future, aid the predictive validity of the construct of CG have not been identified.
The emotion regulation (ER) theory has been used to explain the neurobiological underpinnings of grief and
related symptoms. Accordingly, an intact ER neural system could play an important role in coping with grief,
separation distress including sadness, and eventual acceptance of the loss. Our central hypothesis is that, in
older adults with AG, brain network function features of emotion dysregulation are early and critical
measures of heterogeneous grief trajectories and persistence of CG symptoms. Specifically, we theorize
that amygdala hyperactivity and enhanced amygdala-frontal functional connectivity relates to worsening
complicated grief symptom trajectories in older individuals with acute grief.
To achieve our objective, a total of 170 older adults (>60 years of age) will be enrolled into the following groups
that are equated for age and gender: (1) AG (n=115) and (2) healthy comparison (HC) (n=55) subjects. This
study employs a longitudinal design wherein the following aims will be completed: Aim 1. To determine the ER
brain network function features of acute grief. Extensive clinical and neuroimaging assessments will be
conducted at baseline in AG and HC participants. Aim 2. To characterize the clinical trajectories using baseline
ER brain network function features in AG. The AG and HC participants from Aim 1 will be followed longitudinally
for one year with serial clinical assessments to evaluate multidimensional symptom trajectories and identify those
with CG at one year. Aim 3. To explore the relationships between ER brain network changes and clinical
trajectories. AG and HC participants will complete a second brain MRI to quantify ER brain network function
measures at one year. We expect to identify brain network function biomarkers of emotion dysregulation that, in
the future, could serve as predictors of pathological grief symptom trajectories and CG persistence in older adults
following bereavement. In the future, these biomarkers could also serve as novel targets for treatment or
prevention strategies in older AG subjects at risk for a maladaptive grief response and CG development."

The mammalian liver consists of functional units called lobules, which are spatially separated into zones relative
to the portal triad and central vein. Each zone contains hepatocytes with distinct functions that differentially
impact metabolic processes. This spatial division of labor in liver has been appreciated for decades, but the
molecular and physiological determinants of metabolic zonation are poorly understood. Moreover, whether dis-
ordered hepatic metabolic architecture plays a pathophysiological role in prevalent liver diseases remains un-
clear. As part of our long-term effort to dissect the functional role of leading type 2 diabetes (T2D) candidate
genes, we have identified the protein encoded by the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene as a key regu-
lator of hepatic metabolic zonation. Leveraging a unique mouse model of TCF7L2 inactivation in liver and an
integrative combination of cellular, genomic and in vivo physiological approaches, we will examine the regulation
of metabolic zonation by TCF7L2, and will determine the significance of the zonated pathways regulated by
TCF7L2 to the development of hepatic fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In published studies, we
unveiled a striking role for TCF7L2 in the transcriptional regulation of a diverse set of metabolic genes in hepato-
cytes, including those involved in zonated pathways of glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. In preliminary
studies we discovered that the expression of the Tcf7l2 gene is ubiquitous across the liver lobule, but TCF7L2
transcriptional activity is highly restricted to a population of hepatocytes surrounding the central vein in adult
mouse liver. These data, and additional preliminary studies, prompted us to develop a unique mouse model that
expresses transcriptionally inactive TCF7L2 exclusively in the liver (Hep-TCF7L2ΔDBD). Using this model, in this
proposal we will test the central hypothesis that TCF7L2 is an important regulator of hepatic metabolic zonation,
and that TCF7L2-mediated disruption of pericentral amino acid metabolism predisposes Hep-TCF7L2ΔDBD mice
to dietary induced fibrosis and NASH. In specific aim 1, we will dissect the spatiotemporal transcriptional function
of TCF7L2 in liver using cutting-edge single-nuclei Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing
(snATAC-Seq) with snRNA-Seq in distinct hepatocyte populations across the mouse liver lobule. In Specific Aim
2, we will determine the role of TCF7L2 in the maintenance of hepatic metabolic zonation and will test the impact
of TCF7L2 inactivation on the lobular distribution of pericentral and periportal hepatocyte populations in Hep-
TCF7L2ΔDBD mice. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will link hepatic fibrosis disrupted zonal amino acid metabolism
in Hep-TCF7L2ΔDBD mice using integrative in vivo physiological approaches. These experiments will dissect the
molecular and physiological mechanisms by which TCF7L2 influences hepatic metabolic zonation, and will de-
scribe the consequences of disordered hepatic organization on the development of metabolic diseases."
10764256,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During multicellular development, cells establish and maintain stable identities by activating lineage-specifying
genes. Epigenetic mechanisms, involving the polycomb repressive system and its associated histone H3
lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) modification, are critical for proper cell lineage specification, and are
frequently disrupted in cancer; however, despite much work in many systems, it remains unclear how exactly
these histone modifications control gene expression, and how their disruption drives malignancy. These
questions remain unanswered, because we lack methods to follow epigenetic processes in living cells. We
recently developed a reporter system to analyze epigenetic control in the activation of Bcl11b, an essential
transcription factor for T-cell lineage commitment. To definitively test whether Bcl11b activation is controlled by
cis-epigenetic mechanisms acting at single loci, we generated a mouse, where two Bcl11b loci are tagged with
different fluorescent proteins (Ng et al. 2018). By following progenitors from these mice, we found that two
Bcl11b alleles turn on independently in the same cell, with one allele often turning on multiple days before
another. This work demonstrates that an epigenetic switch, acting independently on two Bcl11b loci, regulates
the dynamics of gene activation and T-cell commitment. Here, in this proposal, we seek to elucidate the
epigenetic mechanism controlling this lineage commitment switch, and determine impact of its disruption for
leukemia initiation. We will test the hypothesis that repressive H3K27me3 modifications uphold a key control
point for Bcl11b activation, and that disrupting this process can delay lineage commitment and drive leukemia.
To do so, we will first define the role for H3K27me3 loss in controlling Bcl11b activation (Aim 1). To do so, we
will perturb H3K27me3 modifications on the Bcl11b locus, and measure effects on locus activation dynamics.
In these assays, the dual-color Bcl11b reporter strain provides a powerful tool to visualize control by epigenetic
mechanisms in living cells. Next, we will determine how transcription factors work initiate H3K27me3 loss and
gene activation (Aim 2). To do so, we will perturb candidate TFs and cis-regulatory regions on the Bcl11b
locus, and determine resultant effects on H3K27me3 states and gene expression. Finally, we will determine
whether delays in differentiation, caused by disruptions of epigenetic mechanisms, drive leukemia initiation
(Aim 3). To do so, we will determine whether delayed Bcl11b activation slows down the pace of T-cell
development, and whether this developmental slowdown can accelerate the onset of T-ALL in a mouse model.
As polycomb mechanisms operate in diverse mammalian developmental processes, and because disruption of
these mechanisms may be a major driver of malignancy, our findings could broadly impact diverse fields."
10764257,"Empowering patients and providers to improve care for urinary incontinence: EMPOWER Study
Urinary incontinence (UI) affects over 50% of women. Non-surgical treatment, including behavioral
interventions or pharmacotherapy, is usually effective, but recognition and evidence-based care for this
condition remains suboptimal. Frontline treatment in primary care, with system support and specialty backup,
has great potential, but a variety of patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers result in under-diagnosis and
suboptimal management.
Therefore, using established patient-centered outcomes research evidence for nonsurgical treatments for
urinary incontinence in women, we propose an integrated, multilevel (patient, provide, and system) approach
that addresses key barriers to diagnosing and managing UI in the primary care setting. Implementation
strategies include large-scale screening, empowering patients to discuss UI with their providers, provider
education and training, practice facilitation through nurse navigation, and a novel mobile platform “chatbot” to
engage patients in self-management of their UI. A system-based strategy for streamlined referral and
treatment will also be implemented. The implementation plan is fully aligned with AHRQ's EvidenceNow
framework: practice facilitation, expert consultation, shared learning collaborative, data feedback and
benchmarking, and health-information technology support.
Over the course of 3 years, we aim to 1) Implement the “Empowerment for Improving UI” program across a
large network of primary care practices. The program will involve systematic screening and identification of UI,
patient empowerment, provider training and empowerment, nurse navigation, and simple and practical
evidence-based technology. We hypothesize that the program will be implemented with fidelity to all planned
elements and with local tailoring in all recruited practices. 2) Create an evidence-based patient-centered care
pathway that minimizes burden on primary care while optimizing health-information systems, including an
embedded electronic screening tool, that lead to sustainable improvement in quality of care. 3) Assess the
impact of the Empowering for Improving UI intervention on outcomes important to patients and on provider
knowledge and confidence, practice workflow and satisfaction among practice providers and staff. Through a
systemic intervention that is multilevel, patient-oriented and supportive of primary care practice, and a rigorous
mixed methods analysis, the proposed research has great potential to improve practice and patient outcomes
and to generate transportable new knowledge to improve care for women with urinary incontinence."
10776325,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The current understanding of vitamin A metabolism in extrahepatic tissues is that hepatic retinoid stores are
mobilized as retinol bound to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and delivered through the circulation to the cells
where they are taken up and used for all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) synthesis and ATRA-mediated transcriptional
regulation. Our preliminary data challenge this paradigm and indicate that retinoids are delivered to the lung
predominantly via circulating lipoproteins, a previously ignored pathway for retinoid delivery involving the action of
lipoprotein-metabolizing proteins. We found from our novel studies employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) of cells possessing vitamin A fluorescence that lipofibroblasts (LFs), endothelial (ECs), and epithelial cells
(AECs) all accumulate retinoids in form of retinyl esters (REs) and all express key genes needed to allow for
postprandial lipoprotein-derived vitamin A uptake, storage, and intercellular transport. Moreover, our mouse model
studies compellingly establish that the mice lacking locally stored retinoids in the lung develop more severe acute
lung injury resulting in death due to the loss of alveolar barrier integrity and impaired surfactant production. This
occurs even though mice are fed a nutritional complete chow diet, circulating vitamin A levels are normal, and the
animals are not otherwise vitamin A-insufficient. These findings lead us to hypothesize that lipoprotein-derived and
locally stored cellular vitamin A is preferentially processed, as opposed to circulating or systemic retinol, for ATRA
synthesis and signaling via nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs). We are proposing in-depth studies to explore
the metabolic consequences of vitamin A transport and how local vitamin A stores are acquired, metabolized, and
processed to mount protective cellular responses. Aim 1 will delineate the mechanisms that allow ECs, LFs, and
AEC2s to take up, accumulate, and intercellularly transfer retinoids. We will determine how retinoids are taken up
by these cells from circulating lipoproteins and redistributed among them. This will be achieved by kinetic studies
employing tracer labeling of retinoids in mice lacking cell-specific expression of Lpl, Cd36, and Lrp1 as well as in
cultured mouse and human cells coupled with lipidomics analyses. Aim 2 will establish how alterations in vitamin
A stores, which are primarily located in intracellular lipid droplets of the LFs, define the transcriptional and
phenotypic identity of the LF population. Using scRNA-seq molecular profiling coupled with immunohistochemical
spatial analysis of labeled retinoid-containing LFs, we will characterize how exposure to lipoprotein-derived
retinoids defines quiescent and profibrotic LF identity in vivo. Aim 3 will determine the crosstalk mechanisms by
which LF-derived retinoids regulate ATRA-RAR-mediated cellular functions of ECs and AEC2s. Employing genetic
and pharmacological manipulations of retinoid signaling via RARs in AEC2s and ECs coupled with lipidomics
analyses, we will dissect the crosstalk mechanisms underlying the role of LF-derived retinoids in cell-specific ATRA
signaling to regulate endothelial barrier integrity and surfactant lipid production. To further define underlying ATRA-
RAR-mediated mechanisms, we will employ human AEC2s and ECs co-cultured with retinoid-containing LFs."

 Influenza causes an estimated 1 billion cases yearly, with severe cases leading to fatal
bronchopneumonia, particularly in vulnerable populations. Influenza virions express two major surface
glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the latter of which is of interest due to its role in
viral egress and cleavage from mucus. Currently, the only FDA-approved antivirals used to treat influenza are
neuraminidase inhibitors, which are ineffective against some strains. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at
NA provide an alternative therapeutic candidate. Delivering NA mAbs to the respiratory mucosal surface,
where the virus replicates, is a novel delivery method that could improve drug efficacy and patient compliance.
This five-year research career development award will provide training and development of the skills necessary
for the candidate to establish an independent research laboratory focused on understanding how human
antibodies against influenza can be harnessed to treat and prevent disease and transmission in animal
models. Currently, the candidate is a veterinarian and a graduate trainee at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center who
will transition to an assistant professor position on the physician-scientist track in July 2024. Her training to
date has focused on the isolation and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from subjects
with prior influenza history and mouse models of therapy. She will supplement this experience with further
training in developing in vivo ferret and ex vivo human tissue models of influenza infection with which to study
the natural pathogenesis of this virus and how human mAbs bind influenza to reduce pathogenesis. The short-
term goals of the proposed studies are to test the central hypothesis that neuraminidase-directed antibodies
play a significant role in the protective immune response and can be harnessed with antibody therapeutics.
This training will be supported by mentoring from national experts in the study of human antibodies (James
Crowe, Jr., Ivelin Georgiev), human airway epithelial cultures (Timothy Blackwell), influenza vaccinology
(Spyros Kalams), and small animal models of virus infection and pathology (Katherine Gibson-Corley). The
applicant aims to 1) elucidate the mechanisms of influenza type B (IBV) inhibition by mAbs specific to the
neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein to test the hypotheses that NA antibodies exert distinct mechanisms of
protection, 2) use a human airway model of IBV infection to determine how NA mAbs in the presence of mucus
behave, 3) and test these mAbs in a ferret model of intranasal delivery to test the hypothesis that NA mAbs
delivered topically can reduce viral load and shedding. Overall, these studies will help define the role of IBV NA
antibodies and the mechanism of delivering mAbs to the respiratory mucosal surface. Industry groups are
developing protective mAbs made by the candidate as human therapeutic agents. Thus, these studies directly
translate the importance of human health and contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the disease."

The central goal of this R50 Clinician Scientist Award application is to establish and refine processes that
facilitate clinical trials in cancer interception at The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC), a unique
goal that is different from the majority of R50 applicants which focus on cancer treatment trials. Cancer
prevention⎯renamed cancer interception, i.e., active rather than passive cancer prevention to disrupt cancer
pathways early⎯is an NCI priority. The KUCC NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center is the regional
leader for oncology care and its Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) research program reorganized in 2019
has already had tremendous success; 69% of CPC members are principal investigators on funded cancer-
related research grants, including 29% funded by the NCI. CPC members published 309 articles in 2022. I am a
gastroenterologist and a physician-scientist with a focus on cancer prevention/interception. I joined KUCC in
2017 to build our gastrointestinal (GI) cancer prevention program, a major regional need, from ground up. The
program has grown exponentially and now also serves as a conduit for accrual into cancer prevention, biomarker,
and imaging trials. One such example is the 14-center NCI trial, “A Phase II Clinical Trial of the Multitargeted
Recombinant Adenovirus 5 (CEA/MUC1/Brachyury) Vaccine (Tri-Ad5) in Lynch Syndrome (NCT05419011)”
where I serve as the Lead PI and Study Chair. The KUCC Clinical Trials Office (CTO) has successfully supported
cancer treatment trials, however many of the CTO’s processes for cancer interception trials can still be improved.
Cancer interception trials have different challenges compared with cancer treatment trials because the patient
population does not have active cancer and therefore does not interact directly with the cancer centers. Unlike
treatment trials, these cancer prevention participants may not experience immediate benefits. Hence, the
recruitment and retention strategy will need to be embedded within the clinical care structure which provides
immediate value: the central idea behind my GI cancer prevention program. I propose to improve the KUCC
CTO’s processes by: i) hiring project navigators to facilitate study approvals for the PIs in non-oncology
departments, outside KUCC; ii) training research coordinators in prevention trials; iii) establishing processes for
resource sharing between KUCC and non-oncology departments; iv) streamlining analysis of translational
endpoints; v) improving minority recruitment via Juntos, a homegrown center to promote Latino health; and, vi)
expanding the existing, “The Kansas Patients and Providers Engaged in Prevention Research (KPPEPR)
Network” to improve access of underserved rural populations to cancer prevention trials. I will use my active
participation in two NCI-supported Early Phase Clinical Cancer Prevention Consortia (Northwestern University
and University of Michigan) to bring cancer prevention trials to KUCC and train junior faculty members to sustain
the growth of this program. I have established relationships with leading investigators in the field to develop new
research capabilities such as messenger RNA cancer vaccines for cancer interception."

This proposal aims to address the BRAIN Initiative goals of developing and applying technologies for
innovative study of the relationships between biological processes, neural structure, and brain function, to
further our understanding of how sex hormones (e.g., estradiol, testosterone, progesterone) exert organizing
effects on brain development during puberty. Animal and postmortem human research has revealed that these
effects include cytoarchitectonic changes, including apoptosis and changes to dendrite structure, but
technology has limited in vivo study in humans. While neuroimaging has provided insight into associations
between sex hormone levels during puberty and the brain’s macro-scale and functional architecture, this
literature overlooks potential neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., cytoarchitecture changes) and the impact of
phasic versus tonic (i.e., annual versus weekly) hormone changes on brain development. The proposed
human neuroimaging project addresses these gaps by integrating estimates of cytoarchitecture from advanced
biophysical modeling of diffusion-weighted imaging, to complement commonly used macro-scale and
functional architecture measures, and by assessing both sparsely and densely sampled hormone levels using
three independent studies of youth at various stages of pubertal maturation. Furthermore, the proposed
research applies machine learning to facilitate multi-dataset integration and investigation of how hormone
levels are related to correspondence between the brain’s structural and functional architectures. The candidate
has a background in magnetic resonance imaging, including with developmental populations, is experienced in
developing and applying data-driven tools for studying large-scale brain networks, and seeks further training in
neuroendocrinology, machine learning, and diffusion-weighted imaging to become an independent researcher
in this field. During the mentored phase, she will (1) develop and train a model that predicts sex hormone
levels from functional connectomics in a large adolescent dataset, test its accuracy predicting the same and
novel hormones in an independent adolescent dataset, and share the pre-trained model for use by the broader
research community and (2) assess roles of sex hormone levels during puberty in developing structure-
function associations using multivariate, cross-decomposition approaches. Training from leaders in adolescent
neuroendocrinology, machine learning, multi-dataset analysis, and diffusion-weighted imaging will aid in this
work and prepare her for the independent phase, when she will (3) apply the pretrained model to predict (a)
average hormone levels, to further assess the generalizability of identified sex hormone-related brain networks,
and (b) weekly sex hormone levels, to assess the role of phasic hormone changes on the identification of tonic
neurobiological associations. Then, she will (4) apply further cross-decomposition approaches to model the
role of hormones in associations between the brain’s functional architecture and each macro- and
cytoarchitecture across pubertal development in three independent datasets."

the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), provides a readily accessible,
centralized resource for biospecimens from individuals with inherited disorders, chromosomal
abnormalities, apparently healthy individuals, and individuals of diverse geographic origins for
use in biomedical research. The primary goal of the NIGMS HGCR is to stimulate and facilitate
biomedical research, teaching, and the diagnosis and prevention of human genetic diseases by
establishing and maintaining a repository of high quality, uncontaminated, well characterized,
and clinically well-documented cell lines and DNA and making these resources available to
investigators throughout the U.S. and abroad. The NIGMS HGCR mission is in line with the
NIGMS mission, which is “to support research that increases understanding of life processes
and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention”. The
NIGMS HGCR’s activities, all governed by high standards of quality, will include (1) collection,
establishment, characterization, maintenance, and distribution of cell lines, (2) preparation,
storage and distribution of DNA from cell lines, (3) the development and offering of special
genetic services and biomaterials in response to customer requests, (4) maintenance of a
comprehensive database and online catalog, and (5) publicizing the NIGMS HGCR’s

10786120,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes disease in immunocompromised patients and in
infants due to congenital infections. Following a brief acute phase, the parasite differentiates into a semi-
dormant form called the bradyzoite, which resides within long-lived tissue cysts that are primarily located in the
central nervous system (CNS). Despite a vigorous immune response, tissue cysts are not eliminated and they
pose a risk of reactivation when immunity wanes. It is estimated that ~2 billion people worldwide are
chronically infected with T. gondii and hence at risk of reactivation should their immune function decline. In
many regions of South America, infection can lead to severe and recurrent ocular disease in
immunocompetent individuals. Chemotherapy is available for acute toxoplasmosis based on a combination of
pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. However, there are complications due to the toxicity of pyrimethamine and
allergic reactions to sulfa drugs. Moreover, this treatment poses risks during pregnancy due to teratogenicity.
Current treatment is effective in controlling acute infection, but has minimal effect on chronic tissue cyst stages
and hence is not curative. Although a number of new compounds have been shown to inhibit T. gondii growth
in vitro, most have little effect on the chronic stage. Hence, there is a major need for new efforts to identify
compounds for treating chronic toxoplasmosis.
 The goal of this project is to identify late stage preclinical leads that show potent inhibition of parasite
growth in vitro, eliminate chronic infection in vivo, and that possess appropriate ADME and safety profiles for
advancement. We will develop potent and selective inhibitors of TgCDPK1, which is an unique and essential
enzyme in T. gondii. In preliminary studies, we have identified several lead compounds that are both highly
potent and selective for TgCDPK1 over mammalian kinases. We will design and synthesize new analogs to
improve potency, selectivity, CNS penetration, bioavailability, and ADMET-PK properties of these compounds.
Specific criteria for potency, selectivity and ADMET properties will be used to advance compounds to in vivo
testing. We have developed new quantitative assays for monitoring inhibition of acute and chronic stages of
infection and we will employ animal models for monitoring the efficacy of compounds against reactivated
toxoplasmosis in the CNS. Successful achievement of these milestones will deliver lead compound(s) for
future IND-enabling studies with the eventual goal of curing chronic toxoplasmosis."

Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are critical gatekeepers of nociceptor excitability. In nociceptors,
VGSCs are required for nociception, chronic pain, and their increased function causes pain without injury. Most
of our knowledge of VGSCs in nociceptors and their alterations in chronic pain come from rodent and
heterologous expression system studies. However, emergent studies on human dorsal root ganglia reveal
prominent species differences in VGSC expression, kinetics, pharmacology, and modulation. Thus, the premise
of this study is to thoroughly characterize unique sodium currents biophysics in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
neurons, which will identify novel therapeutic targets and lead to the development of nonopioid analgesics. Our
recent spatial sequencing studies revealed that β4 is highly expressed in all human dorsal root ganglia neurons
but, in mice, confined to large-diameter neurons and C-low threshold mechanoreceptors, which are generally
non-nociceptive. Half of large-diameter, but not small-diameter (generally nociceptive), murine DRG neurons
exhibited resurgent current. This strongly suggests that human nociceptors generate resurgent currents.
Focusing on interactions between VGSCs and their known modulators, I will determine whether human
nociceptors display resurgent sodium currents, if resurgent currents are potentiated by nociceptor
sensitization, and if they are driven, at least in part, by intracellular interactions between VGSCs and
NAVβ4 and/or FGFs. In nociceptors, resurgent sodium currents may dramatically increase neuronal activity by
augmenting spontaneous activity, evoking persistent current, and mediating repetitive firing. In the context of
pain, resurgent sodium currents may convert mild nociceptor activation to trains of action potentials that can
provoke intense pain and lead to activity-dependent plasticity in central synapses. To address my hypothesis, I
will exclusively use human dorsal root ganglia from organ donors. Aim 1 will use bioinformatics to thoroughly
characterize VGSC and modulator expression in human nociceptors. Aim 2 will employ patch-clamp
electrophysiology to characterize tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant and -sensitive resurgent currents in human
nociceptors. Aim 3 will model sensitization dependent voltage-gated sodium channel binding to modulators and
examine sensitization-specific isoforms. This work will elucidate how unique expression patterns of VGSCs and
their modulating proteins contribute to nociceptor sodium current, which is essential for understanding human
nociception. This training opportunity will leverage advanced training in human molecular neuroscience that can
only be done in a few labs in the world, guided by experts in sequencing technologies, electrophysiology and
bioinformatics, and will prepare me for an independent academic career."
10783447,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mural cells, encompassing pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, line blood vessels and regulate vessel
development, stability, and tone. In the central nervous system (CNS), mural cells have additional, specialized
functions: they regulate the blood-brain barrier, mediate neurovascular coupling, produce neurotrophic factors,
and contribute to molecular transport and metabolism. CNS mural cells are dysfunctional in neurological
disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel diseases, and diabetic retinopathy. Reflective of
their functional specializations, CNS mural cells have gene expression profiles distinct from mural cells of other
organs, a phenomenon termed organotypicity. Despite their importance to CNS homeostasis, we have virtually
no knowledge of how these specialized properties arise during CNS mural cell development. CNS mural cells
have two distinct developmental origins (neural crest in retina and forebrain, mesoderm in other regions), but
converge on a remarkably similar molecular profile. This observation suggests that extrinsic signals from
neural tissue control the development of organotypic properties. Further, a novel analysis of transcriptional and
epigenomic data suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the transcription factors ZIC1 and ZIC4 are key
regulators of this process. Therefore, the proposed project will test the hypothesis that neural tissue-derived
Wnt/β-catenin signaling drives expression of ZIC transcription factors, which activates a CNS-specific
gene regulatory network in mural cells that mediates their specialization. In Aim 1, genetic mouse models
will be used to test whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary and sufficient to achieve CNS-specific
molecular and functional properties in mural cells. Similarly, in Aim 2, genetic mouse models will be used to
evaluate whether ZIC1 and ZIC4 are required for development of organotypic properties in CNS mural cells. In
Aim 3, transcription factor CUT&RUN and chromatin accessibility profiling will be used to define the gene
regulatory network and cis-regulatory elements controlling CNS mural organotypicity. Together, the proposed
work will advance our understanding of the molecules and signaling networks that govern CNS mural cell
development, which could ultimately be leveraged to develop therapeutic strategies facilitating CNS mural cell
survival or regeneration in pathological conditions. The proposed research project also serves as the basis for
a postdoctoral fellowship training plan, through which Dr. Benjamin Gastfriend (applicant) will receive mentored
training from Dr. Richard Daneman (sponsor) and Dr. Christopher Glass (co-sponsor) at the University of
California, San Diego. Training in rigorous research using genetic mouse models, epigenomic techniques, and
in skills necessary to lead research in an academic setting will synergize with the applicant’s graduate research
and training, and prepare Dr. Gastfriend to make future contributions to biomedical research."

Our R01 project will examine the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental exposure-induced telomere
damage on mitochondrial function and cellular senescence in cardiac disease. Environmental insults have long
been associated with oxidative telomere damage and heart disease. This project seeks to move the field beyond
an association and determine the causative role of telomere damage in promoting early onset of age-related
cardiac dysfunction. Traditionally, telomere shortening has been studied to explain proliferative exhaustion.
However, this is inadequate to explain aging and disease of a largely post-mitotic tissue, such as the heart.
Telomere associated foci (TAFs) or DDR+ telomere foci have been reported in multiple cell types of the heart,
including cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Our preliminary data shows that telomere-driven
senescence is linked to oxidative stress but not telomere shortening, suggesting that oxidative damage
contributes to the DDR+ of telomeres and senescence observed in cardiac tissue. A prior lack of tools to induce
oxidative damage in a spatial and temporal manner severely limited the ability to understand how such telomere
damage contributes to cardiac disease. Now, we have developed an innovative chemoptogenetic tool that
produces oxidative damage, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, specifically at telomeres, thus mimicking
environmentally induced telomere damage. Another critical barrier in understanding the cell autonomous versus
non-autonomous role of telomere damage in a complex tissue like the heart was the lack of a platform to
introduce telomere damage in one cell type (e.g., CM) and examine its effect on another (e.g., CF), and on
cardiac function. We have now also developed tools that enable the study of cell-cell communication in a 3D
multicellular system, allowing us to reproduce tissue dynamics present in the heart. We will test the hypothesis
that oxidative damage at telomeres in specific cardiac cell types leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence,
and release of paracrine factors, thus contributing to electrophysiological changes and heart disease. We will
induce oxidative telomere damage specifically in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CMs and CFs to
explore three aims: (1) map how oxidative telomere damage communicates with mitochondria to drive a
biological outcome- senescence; (2) define the cell non-autonomous role of telomere damage in the heart; and
(3) examine the molecular role of repair at telomeres in cardiac health. Our team is uniquely qualified to perform
this work, with expertise in telomere damage/repair, mitochondrial assessments, cellular senescence,
nanofabrication, and human iPSC-derived cardiac tissue engineering. This project is highly significant because
it will allow us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of environmental driven telomere status
on cardiac health, which will lead to the discovery of promising new therapeutic targets."

Regenerative processes in the skin require cross-talk of multiple cell signaling and epigenetic mechanisms;
failure of this communication leads to a range of diseases from skin cancers to hair loss conditions. Delineating
how these inputs are coordinated to impact gene expression at the level of chromatin has potential to identify
novel therapies for skin dysfunction. Pioneer transcription factors initiate gene expression by binding
nucleosome-enriched silent chromatin and recruiting chromatin modifiers to provide access for transcription
machinery. Key regulatory genes in hair follicle stem cells are associated with “super enhancers” containing
binding sites for multiple transcription factors, suggesting that transcription factors activated in response to
diverse signals collaborate with each other and with chromatin modifiers to coordinate cell-type specific
transcriptional output. KLF4, a Krüppel-like family member, has well-established functions as a pioneer
transcription factor in iPS reprogramming, blocks Wnt/β-catenin signaling in intestinal epithelial cells, is
required for normal differentiation of interfollicular epidermis, and is highly expressed in hair follicle stem cells.
Opposite to KLF4, KLF5 promotes basal epidermal proliferation, and is required for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
intestine. KLF4 and KLF5 can directly repress each other's expression and KLF5 is absent from quiescent hair
follicle stem cells, but is expressed in hair follicle matrix cells and in differentiating hair shaft cortex precursors
that are highly Wnt-active. The Aims of this proposal are: (1) to test the hypothesis that KLF4 integrates
multiple signals to maintain hair follicle stem cell quiescence by (i) directly activating hair follicle stem cell
quiescence genes, and (ii) complexing with TCF3/TCF4/HDAC to suppress Wnt targets; (2) to test the
hypothesis that mutually antagonistic KLF4 and KLF5 functions control key transitions of hair follicle stem cells
and their progeny. Genetic mouse models, and biochemical and genomics approaches will be used to address
these questions."
10764797,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked with enlargement of striatum and deficits in learning processes that
depend on striatal function. We have found increased striatal volume, greater striatal neuron generation, and
changes in striatal-dependent learning in mice exposed to prenatal maternal repetitive restraint stress. Prenatal
disruptions including maternal stress are risk factors for negative developmental outcomes in children (e.g.
ASD). There are gaps in knowledge about whether enlarged striatum is causative of ASD-related problems
with learning and what maternal, placental and brain factors during prenatal development contribute to
increased striatal morphogenesis. We have preliminary data showing that prenatal stress increases levels of
maternal interleukin-6, a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in ASD, which independently increases striatal
neuron generation. We also show that increased IGF signaling between placenta and embryonic brain is
implicated in our prenatal stress model and independently increases striatal neuron generation. We hypothesize that increased striatal morphogenesis plays a central role in prenatal risk for neurodevelopmental problems and that these changes are mediated by maternal interleukin-6 and IGF signaling. Our focus on striatal morphogenesis in embryonic brain is particularly novel and significant; we will examine multiple levels of its regulation and consequences when striatal growth is increased. We also will test the same mechanisms across multiple maternal stress models—restraint, foot-shock, and chronic variable stress--to generalize these stress findings beyond a single paradigm. First in Aim 1, we will assess the necessity and sufficiency of elevated maternal interleukin-6 for increased striatal neuron generation as a component of prenatal stress effects. We will also determine the importance of exposure timing, a critical
question during rapid embryonic development. Second in Aim 2, we will assess the necessity and sufficiency of
increased IGF signaling for prenatal stress effects on striatal progenitors. We will also assess growth factor
changes in maternal circulation and placenta across maternal stress models. Lastly in Aim 3, we will examine
the sufficiency of increased striatal neuron generation in vivo for changes in animal learning and striatal
physiology. We will use a novel strategy to increase striatal neuron generation in utero: intracerebroventricular
injection of a selective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, CHPG, with specificity for increasing cell
proliferation in striatal progenitors. In offspring with this exposure, we will test striatal dependent types of
learning—procedural, habit, reversal, and interval timing through operant training. We will also measure striatal
neuronal ramping activity during learned interval timing. With our expertise in understanding prenatal stress,
embryonic brain morphogenesis, growth factors, and rodent learning, we are well-situated to address how the
proposed mechanisms could be targets for prevention and treatment."
10934361,"SUMMARY
Advancing racial equity in the U.S. starts by collecting valid and reliable data on structural racism. Structural
racism represents the totality of ways in which multiple systems and institutions interact to assert racist
policies, practices, and beliefs about people in a marginalized group. The patterns and practices of structural
racism, such as inequitable distribution of health care treatment and health-promoting resources, create and
perpetuate health disparities. To date, measures of structural racism have been limited in a number of ways:
First, our preliminary data revealed that Blacks and Whites interpret social indicators collected at the individual
level differently for reasons other than those intended by the measure. That difference indicates a bias
operationalized by the lack of measurement invariance (or equivalence). Second, existing measures are overly
focused on a single population—Blacks—and overlook the Hispanic/Latino population, which is expected to be
21% of the U.S. population by 2030. Third, current indices based on individual- and societal-level variables
capture limited domains and lack indicators from the economic sector, which is indispensable to measuring
structural racism. The wealth gap across race and ethnic groups is directly related to structural racism and its
downstream causal effects on health. According to leading social epidemiologist Dr. Nancy Krieger, “you can’t
understand the system of racial injustice without understanding how it ties to economic injustice”
(2022). To identify effective interventions to reduce structural racism, there is an urgent public health need to
capture the complex nature and impacts of structural racism in a multicultural and multiracial society. Our
overall objective is to develop an intersectional, comprehensive, multilevel, and multidimensional Structural
Racism Measure that has measurement invariance and is valid for both Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. We use
modern psychometric techniques and incorporate economic indicators that better capture social disadvantage.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Incorporate novel data sources that comprise economic indicators to assess
ecological-level determinants of health disparities; 2) Create an item bank from existing discrimination
measures and items of economic discrimination practices with measurement invariance across Blacks and
Hispanics/Latinos; and 3) Test the validity of the new Structural Racism Measure with a diverse sample of
Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. At the completion of the proposed research, the expected outcome will be a
theory-driven, culturally- and racially-relevant, and psychometrically sound measure available to the public to
assess structural racism. The overall positive impact of the tool will be its use in research settings to find
effective interventions to reduce racial health inequities."

the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and
nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to
train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research,
to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The
bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an
unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically,
the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including
American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican-
Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and
institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific
focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on
cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in
support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of
disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two
foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate
cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino
investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity
research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings
in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in
biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and
evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be
facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics,
Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the
Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU

10931539,"ABSTRACT – TISSUE MODELING & DRUG DEVELOPMENT CORE (SHARED RESOURCE)
The goal of the Florida-California Cancer Research, Education, & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center’s
Tissue Modeling and Drug Development Core (TMDDC) is to provide a growing archive of fixed and living tissues
that will support the mission of the CaRE2 Center. In the first funding period (Cycle 1), we were highly successful
in gaining access for FAMU and CaRE2 researchers to annotated tissues from Black/African American (B/AA)
and Hispanic/Latinx (H/L). In total, the TMDDC now has regulatory compliant access across the partnership to
cancer cases including pancreatic cancer blocks (295 B/AA, 306 H/L), pancreatic cancer plasma/serum (136
B/AA, 53 H/L), prostate cancer blocks (548 B/AA, 195 H/L), and prostate plasma/serum (595 B/AA, 92 H/L).
Also, the TMDDC facilitated creation or identification of 4 new patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from B/AA
patients with pancreatic cancer for studies at FAMU and USC. The TMDDC will continue to develop a robust,
well-annotated biorepository of fixed and living tissue samples from a racially and ethnically diverse Florida and
California patient population and make them available to the CaRE2 investigators. The TMDDC will consist of
existing institutional, nationally shared, and future-conscious biorepository resources. The short-term goals of
the TMDDC are to provide the necessary tissue samples for the three projects included in this application, while
preparing for the future needs of the existing and upcoming CaRE2 Center projects. The TMC will address the
challenge of recruiting B/AA and H/L individuals in medical research and the limited supply of quality
biospecimens and genomic data for these populations. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1. Advance our existing
virtual and physical repositories that will increasingly provide biospecimens from diverse tumor repositories
through a single access point provided by the CaRE2 Center. Many cancer types and many tissue models are
relevant to outcomes in disparities research. The broad types of tissues and data required to study these complex
issues make acquisition of a fully satisfactory repository beyond the scope of any single institution. Therefore,
we will develop capabilities to collect or acquire novel diverse and well annotated specimens through our
institutional resources and other resources. Aim 2. Acquire living tumor tissue for drug development. PDXs
have proven to better predict human drug responses than historically used cell-line derived studies. Development
of these PDXs has the potential to facilitate rapid drug development, including testing response as a function of
race/ancestry. The TMDDC will advance the existing Cycle 1 developed tissue repository at FAMU. The TMDDC
will advance on the existing living tissue repository at FAMU. By achieving these aims, we will: (1) enhance
cancer disparities tissue-modeling research; (2) expand cancer disparities resources for CaRE2 researchers,
and (3) ensure a sustained focus on transferring know-how, technology, and collaborations with FAMU.
Evaluation will be based on adequate provision of project-required specimens/resources and by success in
transferring drug development technology and knowhow to FAMU."
10762451,"Project Summary
Visual perception is an active process of information selection. Two critical components of this selection
process are the mechanisms of spatial attention and saccadic eye-movements. Attention allows us to deploy
limited neural resources for privileged processing of salient stimuli; saccades allow us to bring stimuli of
interest to the center of gaze for detailed inspection. The dynamic interplay of attention and saccades is
particularly prominent in peripheral vision where inappropriate integration of contextual information has been
proposed as one of the underlying mechanisms of visual crowding. Visual crowding is the inability to identify
stimuli amidst clutter and is a fundamental bottleneck to object recognition in peripheral vision. It is particularly
detrimental in the case of patients with central vision loss such as macular degeneration (MD), since these
individuals rely on a peripheral retinal locus (PRL) for object recognition tasks. Crowding zones, the area in
visual space over which distractors affect target identification, are markedly elongated along the radial axis
aligned with the fovea in normal vision. Crowding zones undergo systematic reorganization in MD patients with
an elongated component along the radial PRL axis. Despite decades of research, the neural underpinnings of
crowding and that of the elongated shape of crowding zones remain unknown. In this proposal we will bridge
these knowledge gaps in the context of the activity of six neural sub-populations – two cell classes (inhibitory
and excitatory neurons) in three layers (superficial, input, deep) – that are fundamental components of the
sensory laminar cortical circuit. Our broad hypothesis is that sub-population specific activity dynamics form the
substrate for contextual interactions underlying crowding and for the formation and re-organization of crowding
zones. We propose to answer several key questions regarding this hypothesis. What are the laminar
mechanisms of contextual modulation in crowding zones (Aim 1)? What the spatio-temporal dynamics of peri-
saccadic activity in the laminar cortical circuit (Aim 2)? What are the neural mechanisms of crowding zone
reorganization following central vision zone (Aim 3)? We will achieve these aims using high-density laminar
neural recordings in visual area V4 of awake non-human primates. V4, a critical node in the object recognition
pathway, that also receives strong attention related and oculomotor signals, is ideally suited for these
investigations. The results of these investigations will uncover the neural mechanisms of crowding, provide a
broad framework for visual form processing in the periphery and inform possible future intervention studies in
central vision loss."
10768612,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed career development award is designed to support the transition of David A. Brown, M.D., Ph.D.,
to an independent investigator in the field of wound healing. Dr. Brown is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon
at Duke University with a Ph.D. in tissue engineering. His long-term career goal is to utilize principles of
bioengineering and regeneration biology to develop novel regenerative therapies for chronic wounds.
Advanced training in regeneration biology is proposed, comprised of laboratory work under the mentorship of
Kenneth Poss, Ph.D., a leader in the field of zebrafish models for tissue regeneration, as well as structured
activities, coursework, and mentorship from faculty in related fields. The project will focus on re-
epithelialization, which is mediated by migration of basal epidermal keratinocytes and stands as a central
process in wound healing required to prevent progression to chronic wounds. Zebrafish harbor an innate ability
to re-epithelialize wounds and regenerate skin more rapidly and completely than mammals, although the
underlying mechanisms of this ability remain unclear. Based on prior work that demonstrates the existence of
tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) involved in zebrafish heart and appendage regeneration, the
central hypothesis of this project is that re-epithelialization is governed by regeneration-linked regulatory
elements that orchestrate coordinated basal keratinocyte behaviors and gene expression. This proposal
represents a novel approach to wound healing research and will provide the candidate with high-level training
in live imaging, transgenesis, and genomics that will supplement his background in tissue engineering. In Aim
1, live clonal analysis and transgenic zebrafish lines will be used to map dynamic basal keratinocytes
behaviors in re-epithelialization. Experiments will track cell fate decisions and morphologic changes during re-
epithelialization and identify subpopulations of basal cells and their relative contributions to the neoepidermis.
A quantitative imaging practical course will be pursued along with mentorship from experts in wound healing
and live imaging. In Aim 2, the candidate will determine the role of the 103runx1 TREE in basal keratinocyte
fate decisions, then use transcriptome sequencing, chromatin profiling, and transgenic assays to identify other
key cis-acting regulatory sequences involved in skin regeneration. University courses in transcriptional
regulation and computational genomics will be completed as well. Altogether, these experiments are expected
to link critical cell fate decisions of basal keratinocytes to activation of specific regulatory elements. Future
studies will test the hypothesis that genetic manipulation of these elements can enhance re-epithelialization by
promoting basal keratinocyte migration and proliferation, thus leading to improved wound healing. This project
will position the candidate to submit an R01 application in the final years of the award period, which will be
focused on the next translational step in a mammalian model."
10770451,"Project Summary 
Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent, with diagnoses peaking during adolescence, creating a significant psychological and economic societal burden. Moreover, existing behavioral treatments to attenuate inappropriate fear responding in anxiety disorders have limited or no success for nearly half of the adolescent population. A critical barrier to developing treatments better suited for this group is a lack of knowledge about how key neural circuits related to fear acquisition and inhibition mature. The principal goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms underlying fear inhibition specifically as it manifests during adolescence. This project integrates adolescent behavioral models with cutting edge neural imaging and manipulation techniques to elucidate the yet unstudied mechanisms by which safety signals inhibit fear during adolescence. A ‘conditioned safety’ paradigm adapted for application during mouse adolescence is used to address key basic science questions about safety learning with far-reaching translational and clinical value. Through this paradigm, mice learn to utilize stimuli explicitly predicting the absence of an aversive outcome (i.e., ‘safety signals’) in service of attenuating fear responding. Research during the Mentored (K99) phase focused on the connection between the the ventral hippocampus (VH) and prelimbic cortex (PL), regions involved in the allocation and regulation of affective behaviors, and that undergo robust changes across adolescence. In-vivo calcium imaging (fiber photometry) was used to record and optogenetics to manipulate activity in VH-PL neurons in adolescent mice, elucidating a link between real-time dynamics of safety and fear behavior to fluctuations VH-PL signaling. Drawing from the literature and integrating preliminary data collected during the K99 phase led to the advancement of the central hypothesis that VH projections to PL interneurons promote safety behavior by producing a net inhibition of PL that is sustained throughout presentations of safety, but not fear signals, and that the heightened plasticity observed within VH and PL during adolescence provides a ‘sensitive window’ for enhanced efficacy of the conditioned inhibition of fear by safety signals. The goal of the Independent (R00) phase is to identify the PL interneuron targets of VH neurons and their relative activity during conditioned safety. Aim 1 will use a spectrally resolved fiber photometry system to record simultaneously from VH projections and select populations of PL interneurons. Aim 2 will use a Fos-activated (TRAP) viral-vector strategy to manipulate functional ensembles of PL interneurons to establish their contributions to the inhibition of fear. A foundation for accomplishing this research has been set through intensive training and discussion with an advisory panel of mentors, consultants, and collaborators with renowned expertise in adolescent development, fear learning, and circuit and cell-type specific neuronal modulation techniques. The candidate is well-positioned for an independent research career investigating behavioral regulation in developmental rodent models relevant to psychiatric illness and identifying circuit-level targets for intervention and treatment."
10770985,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary malignancy of the brain, has high rates of relapse
and mortality despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Improved methods to
target and treat GBM are needed, but the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and genetic heterogeneity associated with
GBM are obstacles to drug development. The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus offers an
unexpected new approach.
We discovered that the lupus anti-DNA autoantibody 3E10 penetrates live cell nuclei and inhibits DNA repair in
a manner that does not kill normal cells but is toxic to cancer cells with genetic defects in repair of DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs), including PTEN-deficient cancer cells and tumors. 3E10 penetrates cells via a mechanism
that requires both extracellular DNA and the ENT2 nucleoside transporter to be present, which facilitates
preferential penetration of 3E10 into tumors due to their expression of ENT2 and increased DNA in their
environment. ~40% of primary GBM is PTEN-deficient, and we hypothesize that 3E10 will target GBM, have
single agent effects against PTEN-deficient GBM, and can serve as a sensitizing agent for radiation therapy and
as a drug delivery ligand for GBM regardless of PTEN status.
We have re-engineered a 3E10 fragment, hereafter referred to as Deoxymab-1 (DX1), to maximize effect on
cancer cells and minimize risks. In preliminary studies DX1 crosses the BBB to localize into and suppress growth
of PTEN-deficient GBM in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model, and delivers conjugated
nanocarriers to orthotopic GBM tumors. We now propose studies to help translate DX1 into a novel therapy for
GBM. In Aim 1 we pursue studies to elucidate and enhance the mechanism by which DX1 crosses the BBB in
GBM. In Aim 2 the effects of DX1, alone or in combination with radiation therapy, on viability and DNA damage
accumulation in GBM and normal cells will be determined. DX1 +/- radiation therapy will then be tested in PDX
and syngeneic mouse models of GBM to evaluate efficacy and toxicity. In Aim 3 methods to deliver drug-loaded
nanocarriers by surface conjugation with DX1 are developed and tested in orthotopic GBM models.
We believe use of a modified nuclear-penetrating lupus anti-DNA autoantibody against GBM is an innovative
and compelling new strategy that has potential for significant clinical impact, and the proposed studies will
establish a foundation for advancing the DX1 technology to clinical trials."

This Research Training Program in Disease Oriented Neuroscience is designed to facilitate the transition
between graduate training and a research-based career in neurology and neurosurgery. R25 program trainees
receive career mentoring from experienced clinician scientists in Neurology and Neurosurgery along with
research mentoring from leading clinical neuroscience laboratory research faculty drawn from multiple
departments and schools within the University of Pennsylvania. A focused educational program supplements
laboratory research and includes training in translational research methods, applications, and the responsible
conduct of research. The program is conducted in a large research-oriented institution with leading residency
programs in adult and child neurology and in neurosurgery that trains some of the best candidates in the
country and has an outstanding track record of fostering research oriented careers and trainee diversity. Over
the past program period, 6 of the 7 graduating R25 trainees have received K awards. The R25 pathway has
been further integrated into the residency training program at all phases including residency application review,
applicant visit and interview procedures, advance mentorship and research opportunities for matriculated
applicants, intensive support for the selection of mentors and the development of an R25 supplement request,
and multiple levels of clinician scientist career development support. Between the neurology and neurosurgery
residencies, there are over 200 faculty members in our departments, ranging from master clinicians, clinical
educators, and clinical investigators to physician/scientists and basic scientists. 80% of graduating residents
over the past 15 years have remained in academic medicine, and many have chosen careers as clinician
scientists. The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at the
Perelman School of Medicine, where most of the clinical residency and fellowship training occurs, are located
within a highly compact university campus in West Philadelphia spanning a radius of less than one half mile.
Penn is also home to the first neuroscience institute in the country, the Mahoney Institute for Neurosciences,
which consolidates almost 200 faculty members from 32 departments and six schools engaged in
neuroscience research at Penn. The range of research opportunities for our R25 trainees can thus be
extended to the wider neuroscience community inside and outside of our clinical departments through co-
mentorship of trainees with a diverse array of eminent scientists carrying out research relevant to the NINDS
mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease."

The Northwestern University Lung Sciences Training Program (NULSTP) is poised to continue training the next
generation of scientists and physician-scientists to translate the rapid advances in molecular medicine to the
bedside of patients with lung disease. The NULSTP offers trainees a curriculum that includes didactic
coursework and provides basic and clinical translational research training, as well as supervision and guidance
by an interdisciplinary group of internationally recognized scientists. In this renewal application, we capitalize on
our prior success and momentum and provide training in three scientific disciplines: (1) Lung Injury, Repair, and
Remodeling, (2) Lung Health and Aging, and (3) Chronic Lung Disease. The NULSTP builds upon the strengths
of current training initiatives in basic sciences, translational, health outcomes, and epidemiology research and
on the considerable scientific and research training experiences of the faculty participating in our training
program. This training program will provide: (1) mentored research in disciplines that have the potential for high-
impact discoveries; (2) outstanding research training through didactics, seminars, and comprehensive
mentoring; and (3) an environment and infrastructure that fosters scholarly activity and career development
toward independence. This application requests seven training positions allocated to two highly qualified,
advanced predoctoral trainees and five postdoctoral trainees. Typically, this Program recruits four MD or MD-
PhD candidates from the highly competitive Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine clinical fellowship program
and one PhD trainee selected from the laboratories of our mentors, who have demonstrated a commitment to
careers in lung biology research. Trainees will be offered intensive training in basic, translational, and clinical
research in lung biology related to pulmonary medicine. The 27 mentors and 4 mentors-in-training in this Program
were carefully chosen based on their track record of publications, grants, mentoring, collaboration, and interest
in lung biology. The maturity of our training program is evident in the success of our trainees in the past four
years, 6 have transitioned to faculty appointments, and 18 remain in training. Our trainees and faculty publish
high-impact science (with an average ~3.1 publications per trainee), and our trainees were awarded 15 grants
(e.g., NIH F- and K-awards and Foundation grants). Our faculty have competed successfully for NIH funding,
currently holding 36 R grants, 7 U grants, 3 P01 grants, contributing to total research funding of more than 51.7
million in 2023. Thus, we have the trainee pool, leadership, advisory boards, faculty mentors, and infrastructure
to build on an already rich and successful training program. The renewal of this training program will enhance
our ability to support excellent trainees and provide the scientific community with well-trained physicians and
scientists committed to enhancing lung biology research."
10770455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Equity gaps in child health outcomes result, at least in part, from insufficiently addressed social determinants of
health, defined as “the conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age.” Patient
and family needs related to determinants like toxic housing, access barriers, and socioeconomic deprivation
undermine health and shift attention away from completion of follow-up visits, medication fills, and other ser-
vices that promote optimal health and well-being outcomes. Insufficiently addressed social determinants ex-
plain much of the persistence in health disparities. As a result, healthcare systems that effectively monitor for
risks and then integrate proactive responses to both medical and social needs will be more likely to achieve
better, equitable outcomes. Thus, the objective of this project is to co-design and evaluate the “Responding to
Identified Sociomedical risks with Effective Unified Purpose” System (RISEUP) to best meet both the medical
and social needs of children and their communities. The central hypothesis is that an integrated system co-
designed with healthcare-, human service-, payer-based stakeholders, and parents of pediatric patients, will
promote better, more equitable outcomes across conditions by enhancing situation awareness and informing
cross-sector actions directed at common root causes. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific
aims: 1) Identify common root causes of health equity gaps across three chronic pediatric conditions (asthma,
type 1 diabetes, and sickle cell disease) using an integrated monitoring system; 2) Co-design a response sys-
tem to operationalize shared theory and address medical-social risks; and 3) Evaluate the effects of a medical-
social monitoring and response system on patient- and population-level health outcomes, employing RISEUP
in the care of children with asthma, diabetes, and sickle cell living in high-morbidity, high-poverty communities.
The contribution of the proposed research is to co-design and evaluate RISEUP, this monitoring and response
system in partnership with healthcare-, human service-, and payer-based stakeholders, and parents of pediat-
ric patients. This research is significant because both medical and social data together would provide AHRQ-
prioritized 360-degree views of children and communities, getting us closer to those factors at the root of poor
health. This proposal is innovative in its monitoring of disparities’ root causes and the co-design and evaluation
of integrated, coordinated response systems. Such data integration, accelerated by human-centered co-design
and population-based quality improvement, holds great promise for subsequent scale and spread. Expected
outcomes include a potentially transformative template for healthcare and human service systems to collabora-
tively monitor and respond to disparities. Indeed, RISEUP will positively affect children by facilitating a preven-
tive approach to addressing the social determinants and equitably improving outcomes for children, a vulnera-
ble and AHRQ-prioritized population."
10770987,"We recently showed that offspring delivered to estrogen (E2)-suppressed baboons exhibited insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and a deficit in first phase insulin secretion, steps that progress to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanism(s) underpinning this E2 regulated event are unknown. The microvessel (MV) unit (i.e. arterioles and associated capillaries [cap]) has a fundamentally important role in insulin action by enabling insulin and glucose delivery to target tissue, notably skeletal muscle (SM). An extensive MV network forms within insulin target tissues during fetal development, however, little is
known about the regulation of this critically important developmental process in the fetus. Angiogenesis is
foundational for expansion of the cap network during fetal development and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is a predominant regulator of angiogenesis in SM. Therefore, the over-arching highly novel concept of this “developmental origin of health and disease” study is that E2 in utero promotes SM MV development in the fetus and consequently formation of an extensive MV network critical for the delivery of insulin and glucose to and thus insulin action and glucose homeostasis within SM in the offspring. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that E2 promotes SM MV morphological and functional development in the baboon fetus as an essential step leading to insulin sensitivity in the offspring. SM VEGF expression, cap density and MV maturation and morphology will be quantified in the fetus at mid (day 100) and late (days 165-175; term = 184 days) gestation and in offspring at 2, 3 and 4 years of age delivered to baboons untreated or in which E2 production/levels have been suppressed by maternal administration of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and restored by letrozole plus E2. SM vascular function will be assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and by cap flow, as quantified by contrast-enhanced ultrasound/microbubble technology, before/during vasochallenge of offspring delivered to E2-deprived/-replenished baboons. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which E2 acts to promote SM angiogenesis in the fetus as established in Aim 1. We will test the hypothesis that E2 rapidly stimulates SM VEGF expression, cap endothelial cell (EC) tight junction (TJ)/adherens junction (AJ) breakdown, and cap EC
proliferation as early steps in angiogenesis on day 165 of gestation 0-24 h after an iv bolus injection of E2 to fetuses of letrozole-treated baboons. The proposed study is clinically significant since preterm birth, aromatase mutation, steroid sulfatase deficiency, estrogen receptor null mutation, and maternal/fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors, which curtail exposure of the fetus to the normal elevation in or action of E2, are associated with increased incidence of insulin resistance/T2DM in human offspring. Establishing the importance of E2 to fetal MV development and onset of insulin sensitivity in primate offspring provides a basis for therapeutic application to the human."
10770483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein post-translational modifications by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins represent vital mechanisms
regulating protein quality and function that are integral to cardiomyocyte function and homeostasis. The overall
goal of this proposal is to determine the function and underlying mechanism of a novel ubiquitin-like protein,
Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1), in the heart. Ufmylation covalently conjugates Ufm1 to target substrates via a
Ufm1-specific E1 (Uba5)-E2 (Ufc1)-E3 (Ufl1) cascade. Through regulating the function of cellular proteins,
ufmylation controls multiple cellular processes and physiological events, and have been implicated in a number
of human diseases. Our pilot studies have for the first time identified a critical role for ufmylation in constraining
pathological cardiac remodeling and provided novel mechanistic linkages between ufmylation and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress response. Ufmylation is dysregulated in cardiomyopathic hearts. Inhibition of ufmylation
via targeted ablation of the E3 Ufm1 ligase 1 (Ufl1) in the heart caused cardiomyopathy during ageing and
promoted propensity to heart failure in response to hemodynamic stress. ER stress coincided with the
progression of cardiomyopathy in these mice, and pharmacological attenuation of ER stress ameliorated cardiac
dysfunction following pressure overload in Ufl1-deficient hearts. Furthermore, Ufl1 controls the expression of
Ufm1 binding protein 1 (Ufbp1), an ER-resident Ufm1 target. Depletion of Ufbp1 diminished Xbp-1 splicing,
blunted Xbp-1s signaling and aggravated ER stress-induced cell injury, recapitulating most aspects of Ufl1
depletion. Moreover, ER stress promotes the binding of Ufbp1 to IRE1α, a key ER stress transducer that
activates cardioprotective Xbp-1s signaling. These data collectively suggest that Ufbp1 acts downstream of Ufl1
to protect CMs against pathogenic insults and is a crucial regulator of IRE1a/Xbp-1s signaling in cardiomyocytes.
Therefore, this proposal is to test the hypothesis that ufmylation protects against pathological cardiac remodeling
by targeting Ufbp1 to activate the adaptive ER stress response in cardiomyocytes. To test this hypothesis, Aim
1 will define the pathophysiological roles of Ufbp1 in the heart; Aim 2 will identify molecular bases of how
ufmylation activates the adaptive ER stress response signaling in cardiomyocytes; Aim 3 will elucidate the
functional importance of Ufbp1 ufmylation in activating IRE1a/Xbp-1s signaling and limiting cellular damage in
response to stress. The proposed study is the first to target protein ufmylation in a model of cardiac failure and
will employ unique tools including three new genetically-engineered mouse models to provide translational
significance. Completion of this project will establish a novel role of post-translational modification (ufmylation)
in the regulation of cardiac function and suggest new molecular targets for exploitation in the treatment of heart
disease."
10770375,"The long-term goal of this proposal is to define the contribution of altered epigenetic patterns and
genome organization to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a
devastating cancer that is initiated by somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. AML cells are
also characterized by DNA methylation changes and altered gene expression patterns, but the relationships
between AML mutations, DNA methylation, and transcriptional activity in AML are poorly understood. We have
performed comprehensive epigenetic analysis to investigate the regulatory mechanisms that control expression
of the HOX gene loci in AML cells, which encode transcription factors that maintain normal hematopoietic stem
cell identity and promote self-renewal in AML. These studies have identified specific long-range three-
dimensional (3D) genome interactions at the HOXA locus that are increased in AML vs. normal hematopoietic
stem cells. Further analysis has showed that the loci involved in these interactions have AML-specific epigenetic
changes suggesting they may be enhancers. We have extended these studies by performing a genome-wide
analysis of DNA methylation and 3D genome architecture in primary AML samples. This demonstrated that AMLs
with canonical mutations in either IDH1 or IDH2 have focal hypermethylation at enhancers that form direct
interactions with genes relevant for AML pathogenesis, including MYC and ETV6. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that epigenetic changes at specific regulatory enhancers in AML cells can cause the
dysregulation of genes that contribute to AML pathogenesis. Here we propose to test this hypothesis by
performing detailed, mechanistic studies of enhancers and gene regulation in primary AML samples and AML
cell line models. In Aim 1, we will use capture-HiC to perform in-depth studies of the HOXA locus in primary AML
samples and AML cell lines that will define the relationships between AML mutations, enhancer interactions, and
HOXA gene expression. We will then use massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome
editing, and functional studies in vitro and in vivo to identify the specific enhancers and epigenetic pathways that
regulate expression of HOXA genes. In Aim 2, we will use in situ HiC to define the 3D genome organization of
primary AML samples with mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 that have focal DNA hypermethylation at enhancers. We
will integrate these data with DNA methylation, chromatin profiling, and gene expression to determine how DNA
methylation influences enhancer-promoter interactions and gene regulation in AML cells. Together, these
studies will provide mechanistic insights into HOX gene regulation that may guide therapeutic
approaches that target the HOX self-renewal pathway in AML cells, and determine the extent to which
DNA methylation contributes to the leukemia phenotype by altering the function of regulatory enhancers."
10774389,"SUMMARY
Breast cancer accounts for nearly a quarter of all cancers in women and it remains the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US, despite substantial changes in standard of care treatments. Identifying evolutionary
mechanisms that naturally protect species from developing cancer is becoming an increasingly appreciated
approach to develop therapeutic strategies that are both efficient and non-toxic. We recently identified a cancer-
suppressing mechanism based on the secretion of bioactive factors with anti-cancer activity by mammary cells
(aka. mammosphere-derived epithelial cells or MDECs) from domesticated mammary cancer-proof mammals.
Specifically, these bioactive factors were shown to (i) induce triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell death,
without affecting normal human breast cells, in vitro and (ii) reduce tumorigenicity in a xenograft TNBC mouse
model in vivo. These findings led to our central hypothesis that the MDEC secretome from mammary cancer-
proof mammals has significant potential for the development of novel effective and non-toxic therapies to treat
and/or prevent breast cancer, especially the aggressive and hormone therapy-unresponsive TNBC. We now
propose to follow up on these interesting findings by further characterizing the anti-cancer activity of the MDEC
secretome in greater depth (Aim 1) and evaluating the therapeutic and/or preventative effects of the MDEC
secretome in mouse models of TNBC (Aim 2). The significance of this application lies in the novelty of the
approach being used to identify non-toxic efficient breast cancer therapeutic and/or preventative interventions
by focusing on bioactive anti-cancer factors produced by normal mammary cells from mammary cancer-proof
mammals. The proposed experiments will increase our knowledge of novel cancer-suppressing mechanisms
and will provide a solid basis for the design of effective and non-toxic therapies that can be used to fight
aggressive TNBC and/or for the development of protective factor-based therapeutics to eliminate or reduce
TNBC in high-risk populations."
10775244,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The treatments for various squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), such as SCCs of the head and neck, have been
revolutionized by the development of immunotherapies. However, even though many treated patients can
evoke robust initial responses, most SCC patients often experience rapid tumor relapse, the nature of which is
still poorly understood. Such hurdles highlight the dire need to uncover novel mechanisms driving
immunotherapy resistance. Understanding tumor relapse after immunotherapy will be vital for advancing
clinical outcomes. Thus, the broad research objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular network
driving tumor relapse from cancer immunotherapy. Cancer immune evasion is a highly complex process
mediated by both an immune suppressive microenvironment and cancer cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms.
Recently, in a genetically engineered mouse model of SCC, we revealed a group of TGFβ-responding tumor-
initiating cells (TICs) that hijack many molecular features of adult tissue stem cells. Importantly, these cells
appear to be the root of tumor relapse after immunotherapy treatment and are endowed with unique programs
that facilitate their remarkable immune resistance. This key finding raised the importance of identifying the
critical molecular features for these TICs in driving immune resistance in SCCs. In this study, we identified the
pivotal roles of Sox2 as the master transcription factor in orchestrating the TIC-specific immune resistance
program. Here, we will employ an ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral gene delivery approach to achieve rapid
genetic manipulation of TICs directly in spontaneous SCC tumors. With this powerful technique, we aim to first
identify the Sox2-activated transcriptional network for shaping the immune suppressive microenvironment.
Second, we will dissect the mechanisms of how Sox2 enhances the intrinsic immune resistance of tumor-
initiating cells. Collectively, our proposed study will advance our understanding of the immune resistance
mechanisms specific to TICs and how these mechanisms promote SCC relapse after immunotherapy
treatment. Ultimately, defining the blueprints of the TIC-specific immune evasive mechanisms will open new
avenues to overcome the SCCs recurrence and improve the efficacy of current cancer treatments."

Actin, which exists in filamentous (F-actin) and monomeric (G-actin) forms, is the most abundant protein in the
cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and a key player in countless processes in health and disease, including cell
motility, muscle contraction, cancer metastasis, and cardiomyopathies. F-actin is a polar filament, with fast
polymerizing barbed (+) and depolymerizing pointed (-) ends. The control of monomer addition/dissociation
at the ends of the actin filament is a key event that affects all cellular functions of actin in health and disease.
This process is tightly regulated in cells by actin's ATPase activity and many proteins that control subunit
exchange at the ends of the filament. Among those are proteins that accelerate subunit addition at the barbed
end (formins), accelerate subunit dissociation from the pointed end (cyclase-associated protein and cofilin), or
“cap” the barbed (CapZ, gelsolin) and pointed (Tmod-Tpm) ends of F-actin. Barbed end capping by CapZ is in
turn regulated by several proteins, including CARMIL. The structural-functional mechanisms that control the
activities of these proteins and filament end dynamics are poorly understood. To address this lack of
understanding, this grant will tackle the following Aims: 1) Control of actin dynamics at the barbed end, 2)
Mechanism of barbed end uncapping by CARMIL, 3) Control of actin dynamics at the pointed end. The
rationale and likelihood of success of the Aims is substantiated by extensive preliminary work, including: a) all
the relevant proteins have been obtained, including a majority in human cells, b) determination of preliminary
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the free and CapZ-capped barbed end, c) determination of
preliminary cryo-EM structures of the free and Tmod-Tpm-capped pointed end, d) determination of preliminary
cryo-EM structures of CARMIL alone and in complex with CapZ, e) a CARMIL knockout cell line obtained by
CRISPR/Cas9 (collaboration with the Lappalainen lab, Helsinki), and f) proteomics data revealing key post-
translational modifications in CARMIL. The proposed studies should substantially advance our understanding
of F-actin barbed and pointed end dynamics, a process that impacts cellular activities of actin in health and
disease."
10776423,"Dr. Zhou’s research program is mainly related to the bile acid and sphingolipid-mediated signaling pathways in
chronic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
alcoholic liver disease (ALD), drug-induced liver disease, and cholestatic liver diseases, such as primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which are major health problems both for Veterans and the general population.
Understanding bile acids and sphingolipids in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, immunity, and biliary function
under different pathological conditions will provide a foundation for discovering new diagnostic markers and
novel pharmaceutical interventions for the prevention and treatment of different liver diseases. Dr. Zhou’s lab
has developed novel, clinically relevant animal models and techniques that allow the multidisciplinary analysis
of the complex signaling pathways in the chronic disease progression, which impact the overall health of our
Veterans. Dr. Zhou’s research efforts have resulted in more than 60 peer-reviewed publications, most in high-
impact journals, including Hepatology, Cell Metabolism, Gut, and Nature Communication, during the last funding
cycle. Dr. Zhou’s publications have been highly cited (total citations: 23073; h-index: 63). Dr. Zhou acknowledged
the RCS award and VA Merit Award in her publications which were submitted from her lab after she received
her RCS award in October 2018. Dr. Zhou has been actively expanding her research program by collaborating
with VA physician-scientists. PTSD is a trauma- and stressor-related mental disorder which poses a significant
impact on veterans’ health. The prevalence of PTSD is much higher in Veterans than in general populations,
especially in combat Veterans. PTSD can result in end-organ damage, such as liver cirrhosis. Both cirrhosis and
PTSD independently lead to gut dysbiosis and brain dysfunction. By collaborating with Dr. Jasmohan Bajaj, a
well-known VA clinical scientist in this field, we have shown that cognitive dysfunction in Veterans with cirrhosis
is linked with dysbiosis, disruption of bile acid homeostasis and alteration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA),
which result in a pro-inflammatory milieu and impairment of cognitive function in Veterans. However, alterations
in the gut-liver-brain axis in Veterans with PTSD and Cirrhosis require further investigation. Dr. Zhou is a highly
valued resource and member of the Central Virginia Veteran’s Health System and the affiliated university (VCU).
She maintained a highly productive research program which is recognized nationally and internationally for her
significant contribution to the bile acid research field. She successfully established the LC-MS/MS core for bile
acid and SCFA profiling and NanoString GeoMax core via VA ShEEP grant support and has provided service to
many VA-funded and academic researchers locally and nationally. Dr. Zhou will continue to expand her
collaboration with other VA and non-VA scientists, especially the junior investigators new to the bile acid field.
Dr. Zhou is actively involved in mentoring and training graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, physician-
scientists (both early-stage and mid-career scientists), and undergraduate students. Dr. Zhou will continue to
promote the research program highly relevant to Veterans’ health. Dr. Zhou continues to play an important
leadership role in both local and national liver research societies. Over the past 15 years, Dr. Zhou not only
maintained an outstanding research program and provided excellent mentorship for the career development of
trainees and early-stage investigators but also made significant contributions to local VA, national VA, affiliated
university, and professional societies during the last ten years. In summary, Dr. Zhou’s research program is
nationally and internationally recognized for its focus on bile acid-mediated signaling. Her research addresses a
highly significant health problem in Veterans and is particularly relevant to the overall VA healthcare mission. Dr.
Zhou will continue to play an important role in facilitating collaboration and mentoring. Her effort in her role as
SRCS will make significant contributions to the overall VA patient care mission."

Membrane transporters in the Solute Carrier (SLC) and ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamilies play essential
roles in the transmembrane movement of solutes including drugs, dietary supplements and nutrients.
Transporters on the polarized membranes of epithelial cells such as those in the placenta, mammary gland and
gut or polarized endothelial cells such as those of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) play essential roles in
transcellular flux of their substrates. A significant gap in our understanding of both SLC and ABC transporters
exists as many transporters have not been systematically characterized and the range of substrates is not known
or poorly understood. In response to RFA-HD-23-003, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary Transporter
Elucidation Center at the University of California San Francisco (TECUCSF), which brings together expert
scientists in transporter biology and pharmacology, membrane transporter structural biology, computational
biology, and chemo-informatics. The overall goal of the TECUCSF is to elucidate the ligand specificity, protein
structure and cellular localization of SLC and ABC transporters in the human BBB. Based on preliminary studies
from our global proteomic analyses, we will prioritize a list of 30 highly expressed and understudied/orphan SLC
and ABC transporters in the human BBB (BBB-30). Key knowledge gaps of these 30 transporters will be
addressed by research conducted under three aims. For Aim 1, we will perform in silico docking of neuroactive
drugs, nutrients, and dietary supplements using experimentally determined structures or structures based on
computed structural models of transporters in the BBB-30. For each of these transporters, we will create
recombinant cell lines expressing the transporter and functional assays to validate the in silico results, which will
result in the discovery of ligands for both understudied and orphan transporters. For Aim 2, we will use cryoEM
to determine the structure of selected transporters in the BBB-30, which do not have available structures. Finally,
for Aim 3, we will perform localization of the BBB-30 in human endothelial cell models using available antibodies
and flux studies will be performed to confirm the localization. To support our studies and enhance studies in the
Transporter Elucidation Network (TEN), three cores will be established: TECUCSF Informatics and Modeling Core;
TECUCSF Structure Core; and TECUCSF Function Core. The cores will provide support for research proposed in
each of the three aims, as well for investigators in the TEN. TECUCSF will work together with other TECs within
the TEN to generate knowledge and resources that will be shared with the broader research community through
RESOLUTE to advance our understanding of nutrient, drug, and dietary supplement constituent transport across
the BBB."
10763771,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Normal proteins utilize most or all of life’s 20 amino acids to fold into stable structures responsible for their biological
function. Perplexingly, between 10 and 20% of the proteins found in eukaryotic cells are unusual in containing only a
subset of the 20 amino acid residues utilized by normal proteins. These unusual proteins are described as being of low
sequence complexity and have long been understood to exist in states of intrinsic disorder. Despite constituting no more
than 20% of the proteome, upwards of 75% of all forms of post-translational modification have been mapped to low
complexity (LC) domains. It is likewise the case than more than 50% of all forms of alternative pre-mRNA splicing map to
LC domains. These facts predict that a disproportionate amount of cellular regulation funnels through LC domains.
More than a decade ago the group led by Dirk Gorlich at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Munich,
Germany described the surprising ability of a low complexity domain to become phase separated in the form of a
hydrogel. The work of Gorlich and colleagues was focused on the phenylalanine:glycine-rich low complexity (LC) domains
of nucleoporin proteins, and their work offered a conceptual framework for understanding how the permeability barrier
of the nuclear pore might work in a mechanistic sense. Parallel work by the McKnight lab in the Biochemistry
Department of UT Southwestern Medical Center yielded similar findings in studies of the tyrosine:glycine-rich LC domain
of the fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) RNA binding protein. In the latter case, self-association by the FUS LC domain was
postulated to represent the basis by which RNA-rich membraneless granules form in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.
Over the past decade the McKnight laboratory investigated the concept that self-association of LC domains is mediated
by the formation of labile cross-β structures poised at the threshold of thermodynamic equilibrium. In collaborative
experiments with Robert Tycko at the National Institutes of Health, the McKnight group described the first atomic
structure of a labile cross-β structure. This work revealed the chemical basis accounting for both the lability of the FUS
structure and the specificity of self-association. It also showed that the structure was invariantly formed from the same,
limited segment of the FUS LC domain. The structure-forming region of the FUS LC domain has come to be termed a
labile, cross-β core. Similarly labile and invariantly localized cross-β cores have now been discovered within the LC
domains of three other RNA binding proteins (hnRNPA2, TDP-43 and ataxin-2), the phenylalanine:glycine repeats of the
Nup54 and Nup98 nucleoporin proteins, and the LC domains localized within the amino terminal segments of six different
intermediate filament proteins. Extensive evidence has established that cross-β cores nucleate self-association, phase
separation and the biological function of LC domains. This labile cross-β concept of LC domain self-association explains
how phosphorylation of specific residues can disassemble both RNA granules and intermediate filaments, how
methionine oxidation can disassemble labile cellular structures surrounding mitochondria, and how idiosyncratic human
mutations within LC domains can aberrantly stabilize otherwise labile assemblies leading to neurological and
neurodegenerative diseases."

World Trade Center (WTC) responders observed traumatic destruction and loss of life during months of rescue
and recovery work. In this study, we will focus on WTC non-traditional responders (NTR), such as construction,
electrical, and transportation workers, who have experienced persistently high rates of mental health
diagnoses in the two decades since 9/11. Gainful employment and the quality of one's working conditions are
important social determinants of health and well-being that can impact mental health, health behaviors, and
lifestyle medicine factors. Workplaces offer ideal settings for interventions that target mental health, well-being,
and health behaviors by improving the conditions of work, and ensuring that workplace policies, programs, and
practices promote health. However, little research has focused on the important role that work has in
supporting (or hindering) WTC NTR mental health, health behaviors, and lifestyle medicine factors. This
proposed study will take advantage of rigorous longitudinal data collected from the WTC General Responder
Cohort. These data will also provide a foundation for collecting new data and pursuing new areas of inquiry.
The objective of this study is to identify how different employment profiles, working conditions, and union and
employer policies, programs, and practices have affected WTC NTR mental health, worker well-being, and
health and lifestyle behaviors in the 20 years since 9/11. We will use data from the General Responder Cohort
and link these data to new survey data collected from WTC NTR who are currently working. Specifically, we
aim to: 1) Determine the relationships between employment profiles of WTC NTR and their mental health,
health behaviors, and lifestyle medicine factors; and 2) Among currently employed WTC NTR, identify working
conditions, policies, and practices that are supportive of (or harmful to) mental health, work-related well-being,
healthy behaviors, and other lifestyle factors. We will consider four of the six pillars of lifestyle medicine:
avoidance of substance misuse, sleep hygiene, social connectedness, and stress management and positive
psychology. Specifically, we will focus on how NTR employment profiles and working conditions, as well as
current organizational (employer and union) policies, programs, and practices, have cascading effects on these
pillars of lifestyle medicine. At the completion of this study, we expect to determine the extent to which
employment and supportive working conditions promote responders' mental health and health behaviors. The
new knowledge we generate on the relationships between WTC NTR mental health and employment can be
used as the foundation for future epidemiologic and intervention research. Our study results may also inform
recommendations for workplace policies, programs, and practices to improve the health and well-being of WTC
NTR. The impact of the study findings has the potential to extend beyond WTC NTR, to traditional responders
as well as responders of current and future traumatic events."
10929998,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs) are the most common tumor in newborns, have significant perinatal morbidity
and mortality, a 35% rate of recurrence, and lack good biomarkers to predict recurrence risk. SCTs are believed
to originate from apoptosis-resistant embryonic gamete-precursors known as primordial germ cells (PGCs). In
mice, PGCs can revert to pluripotent cells called embryonic germ cells (EGCs) when exposed to a specific
cocktail of growth factors, however, establishing an in vitro model of human EGCs has been technically and
ethically challenging. The proposed Research Training Plan will leverage human induced pluripotent stem cell
derived PGC-like cells (PGC-LCs) and EGC-like cells (EGC-LCs), single cell multi-omic technologies, and an
innovative mouse embryonic injection model to study the process by which PGCs lead to teratoma formation.
The central hypothesis is that SCTs arise from apoptosis-resistant ectopic PGCs that have been reverted to a
pluripotent state resembling PGC to EGC reversion, and the most aggressive SCTs have tumor environment
interactions that maintain these pluripotent cells. In Aim 1, the trainee, MD PhD candidate Ernesto Rojas, will
define the chromatin and transcriptional landscape of PGC-LC to EGC-LC reversion with and without apoptosis-
resistance. Then, using the in utero injection model he developed, he will characterize the differences in
tumorigenic potential between PGC-LC and EGC-LCs, with and without inhibition of apoptosis. In Aim 2, the
candidate will identify and modulate pathways maintaining pluripotency in SCTs. He will use single-cell
transcriptomics to identify pathways that may modulate the tumorigenicity of EGC-LCs, and will functionally
validate these pathways using the PGC-LC to EGC-LC reversion model and the transplant model to find those
pathways that improve maintenance of EGC-LCs. The results of Aim 1 will provide the first roadmap of the
changes in chromatin and gene expression that occur during reversion from germline to pluripotency to teratoma.
The results of Aim 2 will provide potential biomarkers and targetable pathways for future clinical use in SCTs.
These studies will identify the important developmental trajectories that occur with reversion from PGC to
pluripotency, improve insight to aid biomarker development for recurrences of PGC-derived tumors, and provide
potential targetable pathways to treat the most aggressive tumors.
To successfully complete this project, the candidate will work with Drs. Diana Laird (sponsor) and Tippi
Mackenzie (co-sponsor). Dr. Laird is a germ cell expert and Dr. Mackenzie is a fetal surgeon. Together with the
candidate, they have established a training plan for him to gain new knowledge and skills in developmental and
stem cell biology techniques and bioinformatic analyses, as well as clinical training, and professional
development. Through the collaborators named in this proposal, the collaborative environment and excellent
infrastructure at UCSF, and with the support provided by this fellowship, the candidate will be well equipped to
investigate the role of development on early peri-natal health and advance his career as a surgeon-scientist."

Indigenous mothers (those who self-identify as American Indian, Alaskan Native, or Native American)
experience the highest rates of maternal mortality and morbidity (MMM) in the U.S. Structural, social, and
biobehavioral factors driving these inequities such as food insecurity induced by food apartheid, chronic stress
perpetuated through intergenerational trauma, and loss of traditional birthing practices and roles require
innovative solutions. To accomplish this, the Center for Indigenous Resilience, Culture, and Maternal Health
Equity (CIRCLE) has been formed to better understand and address these factors through individual, family,
community, and health systems interventions. The long-term goal of the CIRCLE is to eliminate disparities in
Indigenous MMM through effective translational science spanning best practices in preconception, prenatal,
and maternal postpartum care through the first 2 years of life. The immediate goal of the CIRCLE is to bring
together researchers and community partners in Oklahoma/Southern Plains region to discover the sources of
Indigenous MMM disparities and translate scientific results into solutions that eliminate maternal health
inequities. The CIRCLE will: (1) leverage existing and expand current partnerships with tribal health partners
on patient-centered outcomes research and interventions; (2) cultivate and support an interdisciplinary team of
independent experts focused on discovering the bases for, and solutions to, Indigenous maternal health
disparities; (3) establish the foundation and initial processes necessary to enable translational research and

11020150,"Project Summary/Abstract
Indigenous mothers (those who self-identify as American Indian, Alaskan Native, or Native American)
experience the highest rates of maternal mortality and morbidity (MMM) in the U.S. Structural, social, and
biobehavioral factors driving these inequities such as food insecurity induced by food apartheid, chronic stress
perpetuated through intergenerational trauma, and loss of traditional birthing practices and roles require
innovative solutions. To accomplish this, the Center for Indigenous Resilience, Culture, and Maternal Health
Equity (CIRCLE) has been formed to better understand and address these factors through individual, family,
community, and health systems interventions. The long-term goal of the CIRCLE is to eliminate disparities in
Indigenous MMM through effective translational science spanning best practices in preconception, prenatal,
and maternal postpartum care through the first 2 years of life. The immediate goal of the CIRCLE is to bring
together researchers and community partners in Oklahoma/Southern Plains region to discover the sources of
Indigenous MMM disparities and translate scientific results into solutions that eliminate maternal health
inequities. The CIRCLE will: (1) leverage existing and expand current partnerships with tribal health partners
on patient-centered outcomes research and interventions; (2) cultivate and support an interdisciplinary team of
independent experts focused on discovering the bases for, and solutions to, Indigenous maternal health
disparities; (3) establish the foundation and initial processes necessary to enable translational research and
interventions focused on eliminating Indigenous maternal health disparities; and (4) exchange strategies, data,
findings, and recommendations from Aims 1-3 with key partners. Achieving the aims of the CIRCLE is

Among the top priorities of the HIV field is the search for therapeutic interventions that can lead to sustained
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free HIV remission. Although the majority of HIV-infected persons will experience
rapid viral rebound after ART interruption, there are rare individuals, termed post-treatment controllers (PTCs),
who demonstrate sustained virologic suppression for months or years after treatment cessation. These
individuals are considered an ideal example of durable HIV control, with direct implications for HIV cure
research. However, our understanding of the virologic determinants of HIV remission remains incomplete. This
is in part due to the scarcity of PTCs identified through any one research center or clinical trial, and in part
because of the limited scope of viral reservoir studies that have been performed to date. The main goal of this
proposal is to perform an in-depth virologic analysis of PTCs and our overarching hypotheses are that HIV
reservoir characteristics can provide mechanistic insights behind their ability to achieve HIV remission.
Through an international effort, we have established the Control of HIV after Antiretroviral Medication Pause
(CHAMP) study, the largest study of PTCs world-wide. Our initial studies of PTCs from the CHAMP cohort has
already yielded intriguing findings, including the identification of the first HIV reservoir biomarker, total proviral
genome numbers, that predicts which individuals will become PTCs after treatment interruption. While these
results are promising, the HIV reservoir is far more complex than just the total number of proviral genomes in
the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The activity and impact of the HIV reservoir must take into
account a constellation of factors in a conceptual framework that we call the “HIV reservoir ecology”. This
paradigm incorporates the combined proviral, cellular and molecular circuits that contribute to HIV persistence,
including: 1) diversity of proviral quasispecies; 2) distribution within cellular subsets and tissue compartments;
3) transcriptional regulation; and 4) the chromosomal environment of the HIV integration sites in the host
genome. Using novel assays developed in the laboratories of the proposing investigators, we propose to take a
holistic approach in characterizing the HIV reservoir ecology in both PTCs and non-controllers (NCs). The
results of such studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of HIV control in PTCs, with
implications for predicting post-treatment control and determining which of these circuits may be the best
targets in the design of HIV remission strategies for all individuals living with HIV."

Synaptic plasticity in neocortical neurons is intimately tied to learning and memory. Decades of
research in acute brain slices have characterized the patterns of spike timing required to evoke
synaptic change in minute detail, but it remains unknown whether these conditions occur and
are sufficient to drive synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Indeed, in vivo recordings indicate
that neocortical neurons live in an environment of profound inhibition that lowers overall firing
rates and prevents plasticity. How then do cortical neurons escape this inhibition to encounter
appropriate conditions for plasticity during learning? New evidence suggests that parvalbumin
(PV) GABAergic neurons may play a dominant role in regulating cortical activity and controlling
network rewiring, particularly at the early stages of learning. Using a multiwhisker stimulus
coupled to a water reward, we have developed a paradigm for sensory association learning that
drives rapid changes in excitatory synaptic strength in mouse barrel cortex. Importantly, our
new data indicate that PV output to neocortical pyramidal neurons is markedly suppressed at
the earliest stages of sensory training. Our experiments will integrate in vivo and acute brain
slice recordings to test the hypothesis that PV neurons are a dominant regulator of sensory-
evoked activity in mouse barrel cortex. We propose that reward-related acetylcholine release
indirectly suppresses PV neural firing to depress PV output and increase sensory-evoked
activity during learning. Our experiments will identify mechanisms for cortical disinhibition that
facilitate experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in sensory cortex."

 Age-related diseases, including cancer, are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Western
society. While cancer in the genetically heterogeneous human population primarily occurs in the aged, cancer
research to-date has primarily utilized young, inbred animals. As the effect of aging and host factors on cancer
development and progression has grown increasingly evident, the limitations of this approach have become
clear. Understanding how aging impacts cancer development, progression, and the response to interventions
will provide mechanistic insights into the prevention and treatment of cancer as individuals grow older, and
eventually will permit the development of new pharmacological approaches to this age-associated disease that
will enable healthy aging.
 Here, we build on recent work by our team and others demonstrating that restricting dietary protein, or
restriction of specific dietary amino acids, can extend the lifespan and healthspan of mice. We will utilize
methionine restriction (MR), a dietary intervention that extends longevity and improves metabolic health in mice,
and which in mouse xenograft studies has been shown to slow the progression of certain cancers, including
breast cancer, the most common cancer in older women. Limitations of MR research to date include the fact that
the effect of MR on healthspan is limited in scope, that the effects of MR have been studied only in a few young
mouse strains, and that the cancer studies done to-date have exclusively relied on young hosts.
 Understanding how MR affects the healthspan, longevity, and natural development of breast cancer
during the aging of genetically heterogeneous mice will provide valuable new insights into the potential
application of MR-based interventions for the health, longevity and treatment of cancer in the genetically
heterogeneous human population. We will use cutting edge techniques to isolate and characterize cancer
initiating cells (CICs), examine how changes in levels of methionine and its metabolites affect the epigenome.
We will use two breast tumor models to examine how host age impacts CICs, tumor growth and/or metastasis
and the response to MR. Finally, we will determine the role of specific molecular sensors of methionine
metabolites in the epigenetic and anti-cancer effects of MR during aging. The proposed work will address long-
standing questions regarding the molecular mechanisms by which dietary components regulate healthy aging
and cancer."
10753109,"Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects 1 in 10 Veterans and is associated with significant morbidity
and mortality. However, few individuals receive evidenced-based psychosocial interventions or medications for
AUD (MAUD). Common barriers to treatment include long wait times, stigma, and distance from treatment
facilities. Despite clinical guidelines and evidence indicating superior outcomes, even fewer individuals receive
MAUD and psychosocial interventions conjointly. The VA prioritizes expanding access to AUD interventions in
primary care, but it is difficult to deliver psychosocial interventions in primary care, and care often includes
MAUD only. Smartphone mobile applications (apps) that deliver psychosocial interventions concurrent with
MAUD may address the gap between recommended and current practices for AUD and appeal to Veterans
who prefer to receive their AUD care in primary care. Alcohol intervention apps have been associated with
improved drinking-related and mental health outcomes. Self-monitoring of alcohol use, a common feature in
apps, may also increase MAUD adherence. Step Away, an app for self-management of alcohol use problems,
is designed to guide development and use of personalized strategies to moderate or abstain from drinking. In
single-arm cohort studies, we assessed the acceptability and usability of Step Away and Stand Down (SD-
App), the Veteran version of the app and focus of this proposal, among Veterans with alcohol use problems.
The apps received favorable ratings regarding perceived effectiveness, efficiency, and overall satisfaction, and
were associated with reductions in heavy drinking days and drinking-related consequences.
Significance: This study has the potential to substantially improve Veterans’ receipt of guideline-concordant
AUD care and support national VA initiatives to increase access to AUD care in general healthcare clinics.
Innovation & Impact: To our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated the effectiveness of an alcohol-related
intervention, delivered by smartphone, with MAUD in primary care. Smartphone apps can be scaled up at
relatively low cost, potentially saving lives and improving the quality of care of tens of thousands of Veterans.
Specific Aims: Our two aims are to: 1) determine whether MAUD plus SD-App offered to primary care
patients diagnosed with AUD, compared to MAUD only, results in (a) greater reductions in heavy drinking
days, from baseline to 6-months (primary), (b) greater improvements in alcohol consequences, alcohol use risk
levels, and mental health outcomes, from baseline to 6-months (secondary), 2) conduct a process evaluation
to identify factors that influence the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of SD-App in combination with
MAUD in VA primary care from Veterans’, clinical pharmacist specialists’ and clinical leaders’ perspectives. We
will also explore whether MAUD plus SD-App increases MAUD 6-month adherence relative to SD-App alone.
Methodology: Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework,
this Hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation trial will enroll 330 Veterans across 10 VA sites. Veterans between
ages 18-80, meeting AUD criteria, and planning to initiate MAUD will be randomized to MAUD+SD-App or
MAUD only. Participants randomized to MAUD+SD-App will receive access to SD-App. MAUD will be
prescribed by primary care-based clinical pharmacists per standard clinical care. The primary and secondary
outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months using participant self-report and electronic
medical record data. We will complete qualitative interviews to assess Veterans’, clinical pharmacists’, and
clinical leaders’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators to adoption, implementation, and sustainability of SD-
App in combination with MAUD in primary care.
Next Steps/Implementation: If MAUD+SD-App improves drinking outcomes, we will work closely with our
operations partners to review study findings and to develop a tailored implementation strategy to support
widespread implementation across VA primary care."

Sex is critical to the survival and evolution of sexually reproducing organisms including mosquitoes. A
dominant male-determining factor (M factor) is the primary signal that controls sex-determination in
mosquitoes. Nix, the M factor in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, is the first M factor found in
mosquitoes. In a simplified model, the expression of Nix, a predicted RNA-binding protein, leads to male-
specific splicing of the pre-mRNAs of two conserved transcription factors, doublesex (dsx) and fruitless
(fru), which program male sexual differentiation. In Aedes the M factor is located within the male-
determining locus (M locus) on one of the “autosomes”. This pair of “autosomes” are so-called
homomorphic sex chromosomes that are cytologically indistinguishable except in the region around the
sex locus. The Ae. aegypti M locus is a ~1.3 Mbp repeat-rich region that contains Nix and four other
protein-coding and 25 long non-coding RNA genes. The Nix transgene alone, in the absence of the M
locus, is sufficient to convert females into fertile albeit flightless males, and myo-sex, a myosin heavy
chain gene also in the M-locus, is required for male flight. The M- and m-bearing chromosomes in Aedes
mosquitoes provide an opportunity to gain insights into the evolution of homomorphic sex chromosomes.
In addition to its basic biological importance, Ae. aegypti is a major vector for the dengue, chikungunya,
and Zika viruses. No specific treatment for dengue exists and the first dengue vaccine is recommended
only for a limited population. Prevention of these vector-borne infectious diseases relies heavily on
effective vector control. However, increasing insecticide-resistance poses a significant threat. Therefore,
novel control strategies are urgently needed. Only female mosquitoes feed on blood and transmit
pathogens, and for the most part females determine the size and distribution of the mosquito population.
We are interested in deciphering the mechanism of sex-determination, investigating sex chromosome
evolution, and translating such fundamental knowledge into safe, efficient, and diverse methods to control
diseases that are transmitted by Ae. aegypti. Building on recent progress, we will pursue the following
specific aims: 1) Decipher the sex locus in Ae. aegypti, 2) Identify and characterize the target(s) of Nix,
and 3) Develop efficient sex-separation methods through Nix-mediated innovations."
10932926,"Project Summary/Abstract:
More than 40,000 new rectal cancers occur annually in the US and the majority are locally advanced when
diagnosed (LARC). Current total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with chemoradiation followed by surgery provides
modest outcomes with a 20-25% pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and 5-year disease survival of only
65%. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new treatment approaches that improve LARC clinical outcomes
and reduce morbidity. Using LARC patient samples and pre-clinical modeling, we recently identified a rationale
for combining short course radiation therapy (SCRT) with inhibitors of the immuno-oncology target IDO1.
Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) metabolizes tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway and is recognized
as a potent suppressor of tumor reactive immunity. Our robust findings identify IDO1 overexpression as a
pathologic response in LARC therapy leading to immune-independent treatment resistance and an
immunosuppressive TME. We found that: 1) Radiation induces IDO1 overexpression universally across LARC
patients and in colorectal cancer (CRC) models regardless of MSI status. 2) IDO1 activity directly promotes
critical mediators of CRC growth and treatment resistance (β-catenin and PI3K/AKT; 3) In mice, the potent IDO1
inhibitor epacadostat (EPA) sensitizes CRC to simulated SCRT radiation by relieving immune suppression and
augmenting radiation induced CRC apoptosis. We have conducted a Phase I dose escalation study of
epacadostat in combination with SCRT/chemotherapy, and identified EPA 400mg BID to be safe and shows
preliminary evidence of efficacy. These findings lead us to conclude with following central hypothesis: IDO1
inhibition is a rationally selected adjunctive immunotherapy in CRC that enhances anti-tumor immunity,
synergizes with DNA damaging therapy, and protects the normal small intestine. Project goals include:
Defining efficacy of EPA/SCRT/chemotherapy as TNT for LARC and a pharmacodynamic basis for EPA in a
biospecimen accruing Phase II trial with a randomized biomarker cohort (Aim 1). Defining biomarkers and
identifying precision medicine approaches to support the further clinical study of this combination (Aim 2). We
will leverage institutional experience and expertise, our established clinical trial infrastructure (NCT03516708),
and a standard-of-care cohort, to address this central hypothesis Impact: If successful, we will take this
approach to a potentially practice-changing, randomized phase III clinical trial using precision medicine
approaches to address the unmet need to improve LARC patient outcomes. As IDO1 is also upregulated in
other solid tumors treated by RT (cervix, anal, etc), the approach of combining EPA with genotoxic therapies
might be expanded to other solid tumor types."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal will provide didactic and
experiential training, expert mentorship, and an exceptional research environment to facilitate Dr. Caitlin
Elgarten's development as an independent clinician scientist. Dr. Elgarten's long-term career goal is to develop
strategies that use targeted measurement and manipulation of the microbiome to predict and prevent adverse
outcomes of pediatric stem cell transplant (SCT). Although SCT offers a chance for cure for more than 1,500
children each year with life-threatening disorders of the hematologic and immune systems, the success of this
treatment is limited by aberrant and/or delayed recovery of the new immune system leading to graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD), serious infection and reduced survival. In this proposal, Dr. Elgarten will leverage data from
three pediatric cohorts to characterize the disruption of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome that occurs during
SCT. She will define the microbiome features that associate with acute GVHD and peripheral immune cell
recovery, and identify the pharmacologic drivers of clinically relevant microbiome disruption. Through the
adaptation of non-linear mixed effects models for repeated measures to model the multidimensional and highly
dynamic nature of the microbiome, this study will deliver a greater understanding of the causal association of the
microbiome and immune events after SCT. In doing so, this work will lay the foundation for identification of novel
biomarkers and the rational design of interventions to improve SCT outcomes. Execution of these aims will also
provide the candidate with essential experience in conducting observational microbiome research and with
critical training in the advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods necessary to study the interaction of the
microbiome, pharmacologic exposures and clinical factors that define risk for adverse outcomes after SCT.
The candidate is a pediatric oncologist and SCT physician with formal training in pharmacoepidemiology and a
background in clinical research focused on supportive care in SCT. She aspires to bring her perspective as a
clinician and epidemiologist to the study of longitudinal microbiome change in this complex clinical scenario. Dr.
Elgarten's goals for the K23 program are: 1) conduct a patient-oriented research project that will yield clinically
meaningful results, 2) acquire bioinformatics skills for the analysis of microbiome sequencing data, and 3)
develop a platform for analysis of longitudinal microbiome data in SCT based on non-linear mixed effects models
for repeated measures. She has assembled a strong mentorship and advisory team, led by Dr. Brian Fisher, and
inclusive of national experts in microbiome-host biology, deep sequencing methods and bioinformatics,
quantitative model-based methods, and translational epidemiology. This guidance, combined with the extensive
resources available at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, will ensure the
accomplishment of the proposed research and training goals and Dr. Elgarten's successful transition to
independent investigator."

The ongoing goal of this program is to extend the use of rat models for clinical translation
through establishing an animal resource and genomic dataset to facilitate the translation of
laboratory research to clinical relevance. Specifically, the Hybrid Rat Diversity Panel (HRDP)
resource provides the research community with a foundation for systems genetics and a tool for
forward genetics. To achieve this goal, we propose the following four specific aims: 1) to
continue to establish the 96 strain Hybrid Rat Diversity Panel comprised of 33 classic inbred
strains, 30 HXB/BXH recombinant inbred strains and 33 FXLE/LEXF recombinant inbred strains
through embryo rederivation and importation, 2) to characterize, maintain and distribute the
HRDP, 3) to provide genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of the HRDP and 4) and provide
data analysis, integration and dissemination primarily through the Rat Genome Database
(RGD). This resource will be used to study mechanisms of complex disease traits through
systems genetics by providing investigators with access to a renewable panel of inbred rat
strains and biobanked tissues, reusable phenotypic data, reusable genomic and transcriptomic
data, and the infrastructure to explore, analyze and visualize these resources through the HRDP
Portal at RGD. Experimental rats and biobanked tissues from the entire HRDP panel can be
used for other omic studies, including the epigenome, proteome, and metabolome. The Rat
Resource & Research Center (RRRC) is partnering with the HRDP to provide the rat models to
the research community. The HRDP will have broad utility to the scientific community through
the genetic and phenotypic diversity represented in the 96 strain panel used to study
hypertension, stroke, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, reproductive disorders, asthma, aging, alcohol
preference, anxiety, exercise and addiction."

Deletion of a region of Chromosome 22q11.2 (22qDS) encoding over 40 protein-coding genes is the most
common microdeletion syndrome (~1/2000 live births) and predisposes to multiple neurodevelopmental
disorders (NDDs). Individuals with 22qDS display microcephaly and 22qDS models suggest deficits in neural
stem and progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation may be contribute, though the complement of genes and
mechanisms involved are not known. Six of the genes in the 22qDS deleted region encode mitochondrial
proteins and mitochondria are important regulators of neurogenesis, suggesting loss of these genes may
contribute to disturbed NSPC proliferation. Preliminary data derived from high throughput behavioral screening
of 22qDS orthologs indicates that two mitochondrial proteins (mrpl40 and prodha) encoded in the 22qDS
deleted region regulate NSPC proliferation, brain size, and behavior in zebrafish. The goal of this proposal is to
define the mechanisms through which mrpl40 and prodha govern NSPC proliferation with the hypothesis that
NSPC mitochondrial dysfunction in 22qDS may represent a convergent pathologic mechanism. To this end,
experiments will employ an innovative combination of in vivo zebrafish studies focused on individual 22qDS
genes and cortical organoid studies that model the entire 22q11.2 deletion. Aim 1 will employ cell-type specific
transgenic rescue approaches to determine in which cell types mrpl40 and prodha function to regulate brain
structure and behavior. Single cell RNA sequencing in zebrafish mutants will be used to define how
progenitor/post-mitotic cell populations are altered. Aim 2 will utilize in vivo imaging of transgenic reporters of
redox status and cell cycle in zebrafish to define redox dynamics during neurogenesis and to determine how
mrpl40 and prodha function to regulate NSPC redox status and proliferation. Aim 3 will use cortical organoid
approaches to define NSPC proliferation abnormalities caused by 22q11.2 deletion in a model of human
cortical development. The contribution of mrpl40 will then be assessed by analyzing mrpl40 mutant cortical
organoids. This proposal fits within NINDS' Strategic Plan, to understand how genes guide healthy brain
development and the basic mechanisms underlying NDDs and is expected to generate important insights into
mitochondrial regulation of neurogenesis and mechanisms underlying NSPC dysfunction in 22qDS and NDDs.
To complement his scientific background, Dr. Campbell will receive training in induced pluripotent stem cell
models, next generation sequencing approaches, and in vivo imaging. Dr. Campbell will receive mentorship
from Drs. Granato and Anderson who possess complementary expertise and are uniquely suited for this
proposal. A thoughtfully selected advisory committee will provide further scientific and career mentorship.
Together with the world-class resources and scientific community available at the University of Pennsylvania,
the proposed scientific and training objectives will create a strong foundation to establish an independent
research program focused on mitochondrial mechanisms governing brain development and underlying NDDs."

The L.S. Skaggs Institute for Health Innovation (SIHI)-Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (SIHI-
REACH) at the University of Montana (UM) will catalyze the emerging biomedical industry corridor in Montana
and the surrounding states by establishing a hub to accelerate translation of academic discoveries into
products that impact human health. Untapped opportunities exist in IDeA states to turn biomedical research
discoveries into technologies that address unmet medical needs, disease burden, and health disparities for
populations across the United States (US). We have partnered with 10 academic institutions across the IDeA
states in the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) region—including a community, a
technological, and a tribal college—as well as the Washington Entrepreneurial-REACH (WE-REACH) at the
University of Washington to gain invaluable guidance from their leadership team. Academic discovery is
indispensable for ensuring a pipeline of research for novel diagnostics, devices, and therapies, yet sustainable
infrastructure to support academic innovators in resource-limited regions has yet to be fully realized.
Geographically remote regions have unique challenges in developing and promoting commercialization and
entrepreneurship, including lack of infrastructure, less access to innovators and subject matters experts, and
lower levels of funding. Gaps in resource allocation contribute to higher rates of mortality and disease burden,
and health systems in these areas have traditionally been late to implement health innovation when compared
to their metropolitan counterparts. In order for health innovation to reach clinical usefulness for all people,
efforts are needed to ensure the inclusion of minority, geographically-isolated, and historically medically
underserved populations at every stage of the biomedical research life cycle. We will accomplish our ultimate
goals through the following aims: 1) Identify emerging biomedical discoveries with commercial viability in
academic institutions within the four regional IDeA states supported by SIHI-REACH, emphasizing discoveries
that address disease burden and health disparities for underserved communities; 2) Develop an innovative
implementation system to enable access to gap funding, key subject matter experts in areas of product
development, regulatory, reimbursement, legal, business development, and overall commercial strategy for
academic researchers in resource-limited areas; 3) Provide funding and project management support for
promising technologies and development teams to accelerate product definition studies; and 4) Elevate a
WWAMI region-wide pro-entrepreneurial culture among academic investigators by engaging and mentoring
biomedical innovators in rural and tribal institutions. With a strong leadership team providing diverse and
complementary expertise and proven experience in entrepreneurial startups, SIHI-REACH will train the next
generation of biomedical innovators in entrepreneurship and product development, positively impact the
regional economy, and bring products that address health disparities to market.

10796314,"The vast majority of adults in the US have taken an opioid drug for pain relief. Oral opioids have revolutionized
our ability to treat post-surgical pain and, thereby, drastically shortened post-surgical hospital stays. However,
recently there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of patients taking oral opioids for pain who
have developed an opioid use disorder (OUD). In fact, more than 280 people per day died of an opioid overdose
in 2021(1). While the dramatic increase in OUD has coincided with the much-reported increase in opioid
prescriptions, it is still true that only a fraction of patients who are prescribed opioids for pain develop an OUD.
If we could identify those pain patients most at risk prior to opioid treatment, we could potentially stem the tide
of opioid abuse and overdose death. Recent studies have shown that alterations in the gut microbiome can
influence a plethora of central nervous systems disorders, leading to widespread acceptance of the concept of
a gut-microbiome-brain axis(2, 3) . It is compelling that, coincident with the increase in opioid prescriptions, there
has also been a large increase in the routine and often unnecessary use of oral antibiotics—a trend that that has
altered the gut microbiome of an entire generation. Not surprisingly, given the widespread expression of opioid
receptors in the gut, opioids have been shown to alter the gut microbiome. Furthermore, alterations in the
microbiome have been shown to alter opioid analgesia and reward, suggesting that opioids influence the gut-
brain axis(4-8). However, to date, no studies have examined whether the gut microbiome influences the
development of OUDs. In our preliminary studies, we capitalized on both behavioral variability in a mouse model
of antinociceptive tolerance and OUD, and mouse microbiome variability, both innate and in response to
morphine, to identify microbial biomarkers of OUD. One such biomarker we identified is Akkermansia muciniphila
(AKK), a key gut commensal of mammals that promotes gut homeostasis and has emerged as an important
biological intervention in diseases with diverse etiologies. Specifically, we found a significantly higher abundance
of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) in mice that did not develop antinociceptive tolerance to morphine during
voluntary chronic oral morphine use. This discovery led to our central hypothesis, to be tested here, that AKK
protects against the development of OUDs. Here we will interrogate the molecular mechanisms by which AKK
protects against OUD (Aim 1) and assess how AKK supplementation impacts dynamics of microbiome
community interactions and final composition in a morphine-exposed gut (Aim 2). Together these studies could
inform development of immediate and non-invasive therapeutic strategies to extend the analgesic efficacy of
opioids for chronic pain conditions while reducing the development of OUD."
10796505,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges to individuals world-wide. Since the first reports of
infections in the US more than 90 million individuals have become infected and more than 1 million have died.
SARS-CoV-2 genome has various open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), 4
structural proteins and several accessory proteins. The genome of RNA virus can easily generate mutations as
virus spreads. The constant emergence of new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is the major challenge for the ongoing
development of antiviral drug and broad neutralizing antibodies. The two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech
and Moderna are moderate effective, 45 to 75 percent at protecting people from in preventing infection from the
delta variant, and both of them have received emergency use authorization. More seriously, the omicron variant
was first detected in southern Africa and quickly expanded to the whole world. According to a recent study,
traditional dosing regimens of COVID-19 vaccines available in the US do not produce antibodies capable of
recognizing and neutralizing the Omicron variant. The global data shows the coronavirus pandemic is far from
over. Thus, more variants are expectable and some of them may escape the immune response produced after
vaccination. How to keep the efficacy of existing mRNA vaccines on variants is challenging us. Aside from SARS-
CoV-2, mRNA medicines against cancer and other infectious disease, such as Ebola, Zika virus, and influenza,
are advancing through clinical trials.
 The goal of this project is to develop an integrated deep learning model to optimize 5'UTR, codon usage, and
3'UTR at same time that enables users to design the optimal mRNA sequence to enhance protein expression
level, thus to improve the efficacy of mRNA medicines. mRNA medicines hold great promise for the treatment of
a wide variety of disease, extending from prophylactics to therapeutics for infectious diseases, cancer, and
genetic disease. mRNA medicines have several beneficial features: safety, efficacy, production, and speed.
Multiple factors are involved to regulate the stability and efficiency of mRNA, including 5' untranslated region
(UTR), 3' UTR, codon et al, and several in silico approaches have being developed to optimize these factors
respectively However, as these factors always function together during the translation of mRNA, and individual
optimization is insufficient. Thus, a novel integrated deep learning model for these factors is needed to
comprehensively enhance the stability and efficiency of mRNA medicine. In silico optimization of mRNA vaccine
provides a fast methodology to investigate all possible integration of the ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR and identify
the optimal mRNA vaccine. The interdisciplinary team proposed to develop the following aims: (1) developing
deep learning models for 5' UTR, codon, and 3' UTR respectively, and integrated model for systemic optimization
of 5' UTR, codon, and 3' UTR; and (2) experimentally validate the integrated models by designing the 5'UTR,
codon, and 3'UTR sequence for representative."

T cells play a central role in the anti-cancer immune response. Engineering and administrating tumor-specific T
cells have successfully treated some types of cancer. Compared to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell
therapies, T cell receptor (TCR)-T cells engage tumor cells through engineered TCRs that bind peptides
presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). These peptides can be derived from tumor antigens in any
cellular compartment, making TCR-T an attractive approach to developing novel engineered T cell therapies.
Identifying suitable tumor-specific TCR is the most critical step for developing TCR-T therapies. However, only
a small number of TCRs that recognize shared tumor antigens have been identified, which is the major
bottleneck for developing novel TCR-T therapies. Here, we have identified two tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) from the sample patient that can be dramatically activated by three independent ccRCC cell lines,
indicating that these TILs contain T cells recognizing a shared tumor antigen. We further found that ccRCC-
TCR1 was dominant in these TILs and was shared by all activated T cells. This ccRCC-TCR1 is HLA-B0702
restricted, which is carried by ~26% of Americans. In vitro killing assays showed that these TILs are highly
cytotoxic to the ccRCC cell lines in an MHC-I-dependent manner. These data collectively suggested a high-
affinity TCR that potentially recognizes a widely shared ccRCC tumor antigen. We propose two aims to
develop TCR-T therapy with ccRCC-TCR1 to treat kidney cancer: 1) determine antigen specificity of ccRCC-
TCR1; 2) determine in vivo antitumor activity of ccRCC-TCR1 T cells. By identifying the antigen of ccRCC-
TCR1 and evaluating its antitumor activity in vivo, this translational project will pave the way for future clinical
applications. At the completion of the project, the expected outcomes are to have tumor-shared antigens
identified and move forward to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and prepare to initiate a clinical trial for
ccRCC-TCR1 T therapy."

 Over 200 million people are infected with malaria every year. An effective and long-lasting vaccine will
be essential for the elimination and eradication of malaria in Sub-Sharan Africa and worldwide. Though WHO-
approved circumsporozoite protein (CSP) protein vaccine RTS,S is the only vaccine in current use, it provides
<50% protection that is also short lived. The proposed research will delve into the humoral immunity of the
whole sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ), a model system to identify protective immune responses beyond the
immunodominant epitope CSP - essential insights needed to create new, highly effective malaria vaccines.
 This proposal describes a five-year career development plan to study humoral immunity to the malaria-
causing pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Though antibodies are important for PfSPZ-mediated protection,
the protective antibody targets and functions remains unknown. Further, PfSPZ's efficacy drops in malaria-
exposed individuals and how pre-existing anti-malarial antibodies affect PfSPZ vaccination remains
unanswered. Our preliminary systems serology analysis of malaria naïve PfSPZ vaccinees has suggested a
new protective role for IgM antibodies to SSP2/TRAP, a malaria host cell recognition and invasion protein, and
validated our approach. The studies proposed here are to 1) define the functional antibody correlates of
protection in malaria-exposed individuals and the effect of pre-existing immunity 2) identify new correlates of
protection with a whole-proteome approach, and 3) define mechanisms of anti-sporozoite immunity of
SSP2/TRAP IgM antibodies. These aims will be carried out with human serum from PfSPZ vaccination and
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) challenge trials in malaria-naïve and exposed individuals.
 The candidate is currently an Associate Physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Instructor in
Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Research Fellow at the Ragon Institute with an ongoing
commitment of 80% time to research. The proposal is supported by an expert mentor in humoral immunology,
HMS Professor Facundo Batista, and co-Mentored by expert in systems biology MIT Professor Douglas
Lauffenburger. The candidate is supported by a SAC containing an expert in phage display serological assays,
HMS Professor Stephen Elledge, an expert in malaria vaccinology, NIAID Chief of Cellular Immunology Dr. Robert
Seder, and expert in malaria host-pathogen interactions and pre-erythrocytic immunity University of Washington
Associate Professor Noah Sather. Building on the candidate's doctoral training in malaria pathogenesis and
genomics, this proposal will further his training in humoral immunology, systems biology, and bioinformatics as well
as research scientist-focused professional development and responsible conduct of research coursework.
Completion of this comprehensive training plan will enable the candidate to create a successful and unique research
program, obtain independent funding, and transition to running an independent laboratory focused on malaria
antibody immunology, phage display serologic assay tool development, and vaccinology."

Young sexual minority men (YSMM) make up 63% of the HIV prevalence (18%) among sexual minority men in
Ghana, which has a 2% national prevalence rate. Our previous studies that included YSMM in Ghana show that
internalized and interpersonal intersectional (HIV, sexual minority, gender expression) stigma and insufficient
HIV knowledge impedes HIV testing among SMM. For those in slums, the social and economic barriers in slum
communities can intertwine with intersectional stigma to exacerbate the risk of HIV infections and discourage
HIV testing among YSMM. HIV self-testing (HIVST) has the efficacy of increasing testing, providing privacy and
convenience. Yet its uptake among YSMM remains daunting due to insufficient expertise and intersectional
stigma. We propose to adapt the Many Men, Many Voices (3MV) to a modified version dubbed LAFIYA (local
word meaning wellness) to address intersectional stigma and increase HIVST among YSMM. Whereas 3MV has
the efficacy to increase HIV testing among SMM, adaptation for YSMM in slums will show its applicability to
young adults and YSMM in a different geographic and socioeconomic context in Ghana and SSA. LAFIYA will
also extend 3MV’s utility for HIV prevention by utilizing scientific advancements around intersectional stigma and
HIVST options, which came after the original version. Guided by the eight steps of the ADAPTT-IT model, we
will implement the following aims. 1) Assess intersectional stigma and options for HIVST implementation among
YSMM, 2) Adapt 3MV to LAFIYA to address intersectional stigma and HIVST among YSMM, and 3) Test
acceptance, feasibility, appropriateness, and preliminary efficacy of LAFIYA to address intersectional stigma and
increase HIVST uptake. In Aim 1, we will conduct in-depth interviews with YSMM (n= 20), providers (n=20);
clinics=10, and community-based organizations (=10) that work with YSMM to evaluate experiences of
intersectional stigma and options for implementing HIV self-testing among YSMM. In Aim 2, we will conduct a
summative analysis to interpret findings from AIM1 to identify fit and modifications to tailor 3MV to the realities
of YSMM in Ghanaian slums. In AIM 3, we will test the acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and preliminary
efficacy of LAFIYA through a pilot pre-post intervention among YSMM (n=60). The YSMM will receive the LAFIYA
intervention and have the option to pick up HIVST and contact of ART providers for support if they test positive.
We will assess primary outcomes (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness) and secondary outcomes
(preliminary efficacy) using baseline, immediate, and 3-month post-intervention surveys. The study will inform
the preparation of a clustered randomized control trial to measure LAFIYA’s efficacy in increasing HIVST among
YSMM. The findings will inform intersectional stigma reduction and HIVST implementation strategies among
YSMM, slums, SSA, and other high-risk populations in different settings."

The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is the RNA retrovirus that causes acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease that has killed over 40 million people worldwide
and infected more than twice that. Continued high infection rates has made understanding of
HIV biology and vaccines a high priority. A key molecule involved in both infection and vaccine
efforts is the HIV-1 Envelope protein (Env). Experimental structural biology techniques have
characterized the basic structure of Env, but they are unable to provide details about the
extensive N-linked glycan shield nor inform on the flexibility and dynamics of Env. In this
proposal, we envision using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations as a `computational
microscope,' to provide insights into the dynamics of Env that are unattainable with current
experimental techniques. Together with top flight experimentalists, we will develop and simulate
a series of models to explore the dynamics of Env as well as its interactions with co-receptors
and the cell glycocalyx, in unprecedented detail. In addition, we will use advanced simulation
techniques to optimize immunogen design as well as provide critical information about hitherto
unseen druggable sites in Env."

The Research Education Core (REC) builds upon our successful 5-year U54 Partnership and rigorous 
multidisciplinary training environment at Temple University-Fox Chase Cancer Center (TUFCCC) and Hunter 
College (HC). The overarching goal of the REC is to promote inclusive excellence in the training and 
professional and scientific development of Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs) and students through intensive 
mentored experiences in cancer health disparities research. The REC leverages exceptional institutional 
strengths in training and research education across TUFCCC and HC, the outstanding core facilities of an NCI- 
designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, our combined interdisciplinary research infrastructure in population, 
clinical, translational and basic sciences, and a diverse student population across both institutions. In addition to 
research training, the Research Education Core will nurture and mentor students throughout their studies, infuse 
21st century skills of collaboration and communication, and develop professional career opportunities. The 
overarching goal of the Research Education Core is to support educational activities that complement and 
enhance the training of a diverse workforce to meet the nation’s cancer research needs. To achieve this goal, 
the Research Education Core will address the following specific aims: Aim 1. Provide mentorship and research 
support for 8 diverse ESIs to enhance career development and facilitate their transition to independent 
investigators in cancer disparities research. The two-year fellowship will culminate with an application for external 
funding to support the trainee’s transition into an independent investigator. Aim 2. Implement an enhanced 10- 
week Summer Cancer Research Institute (SCRI) for 15 undergraduate and graduate students in biomedical or 
population cancer research per year (75 students over 5 years). Our successful SCRI program, which offers 
unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in biomedical, clinical, or population- 
based cancer research, will be expanded from 10 to 15 trainees per year (a 50% increase). Aim 3. Facilitate 
academic-community research opportunities to support the conduct of culturally appropriate cancer research in 
partnership with underserved minority communities and populations. In collaboration with the COC and key 
community partners, the REC will establish a semester-long rotation for ESIs and other trainees to foster greater 
skills in conducting community-engaged research to address health disparities. These novel training 
opportunities offered through collaborative academic-community partnerships will provide innovative hands-on 
fieldwork experiences for trainees. In sum, the Research Education Core will promote inclusive excellence in 
building a diverse workforce by breaking systemic barriers (including structural inequities and limited access to 
mentored training), building a sense of community, and offering a sustainable pathway for impacting change and 
advancing the careers of ESIs and other trainees working in cancer health disparities."

Early detection for cancer screening has long been established as an effective tool to reducing the cancer
burden; however, utilization of these services by underserved racial and ethnic minorities (UREM) continues to
be disproportionate. For example, breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remains low
among African American (AA), Asian Pacific American (APA), and Hispanic American (HA) populations. These
pre-existing disparities were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing culturally tailored
evidence-based cancer screening interventions to foster BC and CRC screening re-engagement through
community engagement and capacity building in underserved AA, APA, and HA communities is crucial. In
addition, up to 10% of all cancers may be caused by inherited genetic profiles. In recent days, genetic/genomic
testing for cancer risk assessment and treatment has been widely utilized clinically for cancer early detection,
diagnosis and treatment. However, the testing rates remain low in racial/ethnical minority populations as they
often face challenges and systemic barriers of social determinants of health, such as language barriers, low
health literacy, poor awareness and knowledge about genetic/genomic testing, and medical mistrust.
Overcoming these barriers to raise awareness and to increase testing is vital. Thus, building on the success of
our current funding cycle (2018-2023) in collaboration with TUFCCC/HC Partnership investigators and
community partners in the PA-NJ-New York City (PNN) region, the COC aims to use community-engaged
approach to addressing systemic barriers and promoting inclusion in accessing evidence-based
interventions on cancer screenings and genetic testing among underserved and understudied AA, APA and HA
populations. Specifically, the overall goals of the proposed COC are to: (1) engage the community in cancer
outreach and sustain cancer screening programs within the communities we serve, (2) support U54
investigators/ESIs/Trainees on community-based cancer research through building and maintaining sustainable
CBPR infrastructure; and (3) facilitate and enhance bi-directional communication between TUFCCC/HC

The goal of this study is to examine the effect of prenatal and early life metals exposure on the developing
brain, cognitive and adaptive function, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The unfolding of autistic behaviors
across the first few years of childhood is accompanied by age-specific brain changes that differ between
children with ASD and those with typical developmental trajectories. Infant siblings of children with ASD are at
a nearly 5-fold increased risk for ASD, and nearly 60% experience neurodevelopmental delay, making a high
familial risk (HR) model of ASD infants an attractive approach for studying early brain development and
characterizing early life behavior. However, the initial goal of many existing populations with a wealth of
neuroimaging, cognitive, behavior, and ASD data has not often included the effect of the environment. New
methods of environmental exposure assessment are needed to leverage these existing valuable populations.
Using the developmental properties of shed deciduous teeth and laser-based sampling methods, we can
measure both the intensity and timing of exposure from the second trimester to the first year of life for metals
exposure. Heavy metals are both established neurotoxicants and essential nutrients. Here we propose to
examine the relationship between prenatal and early life metals exposure and longitudinal measures of brain
development, cognitive and adaptive function, and ASD risk in the Autism Spectrum Disorder Enriched Risk
(ASD-ER) Environmental Influences on Children's Health Outcomes (ECHO) cohort (OD023342). ASD-ER
consists of 13 sites, each having enrolled HR infants with longitudinal follow-up through 36 months of age.
These participants were then contacted and asked to provide shed deciduous teeth. The Specific Aims of this
study are to: (1) examine the effect of prenatal and early life metals exposure on the development of ASD and
dimensional ASD phenotypes; (2) evaluate the effect of prenatal and early life metals exposure on the early
trajectory of cognitive development and adaptive function; and (3) investigate the effect of prenatal and early
life metals exposure on early longitudinal brain development. Because exposure to neurotoxic metals can be
mitigated and that to essential nutrients be augmented, the potential public health impact of this study is large.
Additionally, identification of a risk factor in very young children provides the opportunity for early intervention
where reduction of risk for disordered development is still possible."

Advances in Classification and Identification for Specific Learning Disorders in Reading (T1)
Specific learning disorders (SLDs) in word-level reading and in reading comprehension are a public health
concern given their prevalence and persistence. It is estimated that between 3% and 20% of children
experience SLDs in word-level reading while 8% to 10% encounter SLDs in reading comprehension. Using the
most conservative estimates, this indicates that, in the United States alone, over 5.5 million children and their
families are potentially grappling with the challenges and negative consequences that accompany these
conditions. Our aims are motivated by the critical and translational need to develop improved models of
identification and classification that are better informed by the substantial research literature on SLDs.
Achieving the goal of improved models of identification and classification for SLDs in both word-level reading
and in reading comprehension requires a two-pronged effort. The first is additional more basic research on
issues associated with underlying theoretical models that potentially have implications for improved
identification. The second is additional more applied research on the identification and classification models
themselves. This two-pronged effort is reflected in the specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to develop and evaluate
a multi-factor model of SLDs in word-level reading that addresses their causes, consequences, and co-
occurring conditions. To do this, we will implement a testable theoretical model of SLDs in word-level reading
that differentiates causes, consequences, and correlates (including common co-occurring conditions) and that
reflects the fundamentally developmental nature of SLDs. Specific Aim 2 is to develop and evaluate a model
for classification and risk prediction for SLDs in word-level reading that better represents current knowledge
and addresses the problem of unreliable identification. Here, we will continue development and testing of a
Bayesian probabilistic model of classification and a risk prediction model that address the problem of
unreliability by considering multiple criteria and that capitalizes on a recent advance in our understanding of the
prevalence of SLDs in word-level reading by providing informed prior probabilities for the model. Specific Aim 3
is to examine and test alternative models of reading comprehension that are relevant to furthering our
understanding of SLDs in reading comprehension. We will examine and test alternative models of reading
comprehension for the purpose of generating competing and testable explanations of the origins of specific
reading comprehension deficit. Specific Aim 4 is to expand our understanding of the nature and origins of
SLDs in reading comprehension by comparing alternative frameworks of identification and risk prediction. To
do this, we will apply a comprehensive approach to exploring the nature of specific reading comprehension
deficit by testing whether the severity of children’s reading comprehension difficulties is driven by a latent
decoding deficit, a latent language deficit, executive function weaknesses, and/or task-specific demands."

Using advancements in genomics, combined with rich data resources describing the environments around
developing children, and an understanding of cognitive and behavioral correlates, precision education is a
contemporary approach to individualizing education to the specific genes, environments, and psychological risk
and protective factors (called “precision education factors”) of the individual child (Hart, 2016). In this high-risk
project, we leverage an existing sample of at-risk first graders, 50% of whom are English learners, who have
completed a small group reading intervention project with longitudinal measures of reading and language
ability. We combine theories and methods from genomics, geographical information systems (GIS),
psychology, and education, to study the role of precision education factors on in a sample reflecting the real-
world complexity of children who have multiple vulnerabilities. Matching the broader Center themes, we
expand our classification systems to include everything we know about an individual's genetics, environments,
and psychological risk and protective factors, into a predictive model of student achievement, specific learning
disorder classification, and response to intervention. The sample will include 500 first-grade children, followed
through second grade, who have been identified as at risk for reading difficulties and who have completed a
small group reading intervention through a different project. We will collect new genomics, environmental, and
cognitive/behavioral factors data, which when combined with the extensive reading and language data
collected by the original intervention project, will allow us to address the overall goal of the proposed research
through three specific aims. First, we will apply a precision education approach to predict reading and
language development (Specific Aim 1). Second, we will apply a precision education approach to predict
specific learning disorders (Specific Aim 2). Third, we will apply a precision education approach to predict
response to intervention (Specific Aim 3). We will do this work in a sample with multiple vulnerabilities,
including being at risk for reading difficulty as well as being English learners. We will use bidirectional
engagement, including recruitment coordinators from the local communities, a local advisory board of
community stakeholders, and focus groups of community stakeholders to better understand the implication of
findings from this project, allowing us to build bridges between research and practice. Training opportunities for
career researchers and community members are structurally integrated throughout the project."
10925391,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The persistent misidentification of students with specific learning disabilities (SLDs) is a public health concern,
with dire consequences for children’s healthy academic and socioemotional development. Despite decades of
research on SLD classification, there is limited uptake and use of these findings in school assessment
practices, which include screening, progress monitoring, and comprehensive evaluation within a multi-tiered
system of supports. There is a lack of alignment between research-based and school-based classification of
SLD. While research evidence accumulated over decades provides relative certainty about how SLDs in
reading and oral language might be expressed in children, these prescriptive classifications are not always
reflected in the identification and eligibility processes that qualify students for support services in school. The
situation is particularly problematic for students from marginalized groups, who must demonstrate that their
underachievement is “unexpected” and not due primarily to environmental or economic disadvantage and
language or cultural differences. These criteria make it disproportionately more likely for children from race-
and ethnic-monitory groups and children growing up in poverty and under-resourced communities not to
receive adequate support services to address their learning difficulties or disabilities. This project aims to tackle
the research-to-practice gap in the uptake of evidence-based assessment practices (EBPs) used in schools to
recognize and respond to learning difficulties and disabilities. Specifically, we will leverage advances in
effective approaches to bidirectional community engagement and the field of implementation science to (a)
determine barriers and facilitators matched to culturally responsive strategies for implementing assessment
EBPs (Aim 1) and (b) determine the usability of a prototype packaged professional learning community for
supporting assessment EBPs (Aim 2). The work captured in both aims will be conducted in partnership with
schools and districts that serve substantive proportions of historically and systematically marginalized groups
and communities. Project sites represent a range of diversity that is representative of many communities
across the U.S, including urban and rural geographic locations, low-income households in under-resourced
communities, and race-, ethnic-, and language-minority groups. Following the broad themes in the RFA to (2)
further extend translational research; (5) enhance the research base on early prevention efforts; and ensure (6)
significant focus on diverse populations, this project addresses the call for a …required project [that] must
focus on examining engagement approaches with communities of interest to the themes of the Center. This
proposal embraces the diversity that is inherent in US public schools and elevates the challenges and
opportunities for developing the translational research base to ensure school success for all children."
10762990,"We have discovered that elevated levels of the metabolites 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), succinate, and
fumarate in human cancers suppress homology-dependent repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).
2HG is produced at high levels by the neomorphic activity conferred by isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 and -2
(IDH1/2) mutations in gliomas, sarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas, and acute myeloid leukemia. Elevated levels
of fumarate and succinate are found in familial cancer syndromes associated with renal cell carcinomas and
paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas, respectively, and are linked to germline mutations in genes encoding
the Krebs cycle enzymes fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).
 We found that elevated 2HG, fumarate, and succinate suppress HDR by competing with a-ketoglutarate
(aKG) to inhibit KDM4B, a histone lysine demethylase that acts on trimethylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3).
Inhibition of KDM4B results in broad H3K9me3 hypermethylation across the genome, masking the H3K9me3
chromatin signal at the DSB that is essential for recruitment of TIP60 and other factors to initiate HDR. This
work was funded by this grant and published in Science Translational Medicine, Nature Genetics, and Nature.
 Our finding of oncometabolite-induced HDR deficiency identifies defective DNA repair and consequent
genomic instability as an unexpected mechanism of carcinogenesis caused by elevated metabolites, and it
suggests that IDH1/2, FH, and SDH mutations in human malignancies can be exploited by synthetic lethal
targeting with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Our work has therefore provided a novel and
previously unsuspected therapeutic strategy for these malignancies that has been rapidly translated into
multiple new clinical trials testing the efficacy of PARPi in oncometabolite-producing tumors. This highlights the
significance of our work and its relevance to human health.
 In Aim 1 of this renewal application, we will determine the scope of oncometabolite-induced HDR
deficiency in human cancers by testing specific hypotheses regarding metabolism-associated genes that are
either mutated or overexpressed in human cancers and assaying their impact on DNA repair. If successful,
these efforts will identify additional malignancies with previously unanticipated vulnerability to PARPi that can
be rapidly translated into the clinic. In Aim 2, we will discover and optimize new therapeutic strategies for
oncometabolite-producing tumors, via mechanistic and pre-clinical studies. We will test for synthetic lethality
and synergism, building on an initial small molecule screen, promising preliminary data, and specific
mechanistic hypotheses. We will evaluate potential therapies in cell and mouse tumor models to guide new
clinical approaches for these tumors. This work will define the landscape of oncometabolite-producing human
tumors, accelerate the rational design of new therapeutic strategies for these malignancies, and highlight
agents to bring forward for future clinical trials."

Due to the inability of the dermis to regenerate on its own, large full thickness skin loss cannot be restored
naturally. The current gold standard treatment involves autologous tissue transfer in which the patient serves as
their own donor, which may be challenging due to limited availability of full thickness skin donor sites and donor-
site morbidity. Dermal Replacement Scaffolds (DRS) aim to recreate dermis, thereby preventing wound
contraction. However, because currently available DRS lack unique cues to guide cell infiltration, they may fail
to vascularize sufficiently. The critical barrier to progress in this field is to create a scaffold that 1) promotes rapid
cellular infiltration and angiogenesis as required for neodermal formation in full thickness wounds, and 2)
increases the incidence and quality of healing in both typical/healthy wounds and difficult to heal sites.
To address this significant clinical gap, Fesarius Therapeutics, Inc. is developing DermiSphere™, an innovative
DRS product that will regenerate dermis in full thickness skin loss wounds much faster (≤7 days, i.e. >75% faster)
than the regeneration achieved using the market-leading DRS product, Integra®. Once dermis has regenerated
it can be covered with a thin epidermal skin autograft, yielding skin that is more flexible, functional, and resilient
than wounds healed with split thickness skin grafts alone. The commercialization of DermiSphereTM is expected
to improve clinical practice in the surgical fields where full thickness skin loss is common including, but not limited
to, trauma, burns, infection and post oncologic reconstructive surgery, by significantly decreasing the time
required to achieve a healed wound in a scenario of large full thickness skin loss, which will directly result in
decreased patient suffering as well as lower expenditure of valuable health care resources.
Our preliminary data suggests that the current DermiSphere™ formulation will support all these unmet clinical
scenarios. We have demonstrated in a swine model of full thickness skin loss that DermiSphere™ successfully
supports complete split thickness skin graft (STSG) take when the two components are applied simultaneously.
In addition, a small animal model of full thickness skin loss showed that DermiSphere™ supported rapid and
sustained lateral as well as vertical cell invasion, resulting in successful STSG “take” in challenging cases of
wound beds with avascular portions and was able to revascularize templates up to 3mm thick. We have recently
brought the DermiSphere™ dermal regenerative template formulation to design freeze using a cGMP-material
based formulation that is terminally sterilized and are fast progressing in our technology transfer to a contract
manufacturing organization. The overall objective of this Direct to Phase II SBIR is to complete a powered,
clinically relevant large animal study (Aim 1), screen the DermiSphere™ product in challenging wounds (Aim 2),
perform biocompatibility testing (Aim 3), and perform user validation studies (Aim 4). Completion of these Aims
will result in the advancement of DermiSphere™ technology towards 510(k) approval and first in human studies."

to improve clinical practice in the surgical fields where full thickness skin loss is common including, but not limited
to, trauma, burns, infection and post oncologic reconstructive surgery, by significantly decreasing the time
required to achieve a healed wound in a scenario of large full thickness skin loss, which will directly result in
decreased patient suffering as well as lower expenditure of valuable health care resources.
Our preliminary data suggests that the current DermiSphere™ formulation will support all these unmet clinical
scenarios. We have demonstrated in a swine model of full thickness skin loss that DermiSphere™ successfully
supports complete split thickness skin graft (STSG) take when the two components are applied simultaneously.
In addition, a small animal model of full thickness skin loss showed that DermiSphere™ supported rapid and
sustained lateral as well as vertical cell invasion, resulting in successful STSG “take” in challenging cases of
wound beds with avascular portions and was able to revascularize templates up to 3mm thick. We have recently
brought the DermiSphere™ dermal regenerative template formulation to design freeze using a cGMP-material
based formulation that is terminally sterilized and are fast progressing in our technology transfer to a contract
manufacturing organization. The overall objective of this Direct to Phase II SBIR is to complete a powered,
clinically relevant large animal study (Aim 1), screen the DermiSphere™ product in challenging wounds (Aim 2),
perform biocompatibility testing (Aim 3), and perform user validation studies (Aim 4). Completion of these Aims
will result in the advancement of DermiSphere™ technology towards 510(k) approval and first in human studies."

The emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris has produced numerous outbreaks of invasive disease in
hospitals worldwide. With mortality rates as high as 60%, the continued rise of this drug-resistant pathogen
is alarming. Further understanding of the unexpected virulence of C. auris is desperately needed for the
design of innovative therapeutic approaches. My laboratory’s long-term goal is to find new approaches to
understand, detect, and treat invasive fungal infections. The objective of this application is to delineate how
C. auris evades innate immunity and to develop a novel therapeutic strategy to circumvent this mechanism.
We have found that neutrophils, leukocytes critical for control of many invasive fungal infections, fail to kill
C. auris. We propose that uncovering the molecular mechanism of this immune evasion will identify new
drug targets. Our preliminary data provide compelling evidence for the involvement of a C. auris cell wall
component. Furthermore, we have identified a subset of neutrophils with enhanced antifungal activity. We
plan to capitalize on this finding to delineate the molecular aspects of a successful neutrophil response
against C. auris. This will not only shed light on the virulence of C. auris, but will also establish a platform for
future neutrophil-based immunotherapies. We anticipate this approach will have broad implications for the
treatment of a variety of drug-resistant or treatment-refractory invasive fungal infections."

The SARS-CoV-2 host response is associated with wide-ranging immuno-inflammatory
derangements and tissue injury. We are developing an innovative therapeutic, BP-1002, to both
blunt inflammatory cytokines and protect tissues. BP-1002 has the potential to prevent organ
injury and deaths from COVID-19, regardless of viral variants. BP-1002, is a renalase (RNLS)
agonist - a recently discovered secretory protein that promotes cell survival and downregulates
the inflammatory response by signaling through the plasma-membrane calcium-ATPase,
ATP2B4 (PMCA4b) receptor, and activating growth and survival pathways (protein kinase B,
JAK/STAT, and MAP kinase). This activity is contained in a 20-40 amino acid RNLS site.
Because RNLS is a large protein complex requiring manufacturing, we designed and developed
BP-1002, a proprietary 36−aa RNLS-based (97.3 % amino acid identity) that contains the RNLS
activity site. This RNLS agonist is stable and easily manufactured using chemical synthesis.
Preliminary data show that low plasma RNLS correlates with disease severity hospitalized
COVID-19 patients; or in acute renal injury, cardiac injury, and pancreatitis, which are COVID-
19 complications. Also, BP-1002 blunted inflammatory cytokine production (IL6, TNFα and IL1β)
in human blood exposed ex vivo to the S- and M-proteins of SARS-CoV-2; improved survival by
60% in mouse models of simulated viral disease (poly(I:C) or SARS-CoV-2 infection). BP-1002
or recombinant RNLS reduced cell and tissue injury through modulation of inflammation,
preservation of vascular integrity, and apoptosis prevention. Additionally, in a mouse
inflammation model, single doses of BP-1002 had activity lasting 6 (intravenous) or 10
(subcutaneous) hours. Further, chronic-dosing pharmacology studies in mice show a profile
consistent with a desirable therapeutic index. These studies confirm the strong potential for BP-
1002 as a new therapeutic for COVD-19. BP-1002 may also be useful alone or in combination
with other COVID-19 therapies. A candidate for testing is IL-6 inhibitors, which have shown
varied benefits for COVID-19 therapy. We plan further proof of concept evaluation of BP-1002,
alone or with potentially synergistic IL-6 inhibition, to blunt inflammatory cytokines, prevent
tissue damage and death in several mouse COVID-19 models. In addition, we will compare the
pharmacokinetics after 30-min infusion, the route of administration that will be used in patients,
with those after a dose-response studies after SC admin using a viral mouse model. Lastly,
additional analytical studies will allow specifications to be set for future production."
10762455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders are a global health problem; yet remarkably little is known
about their neurological basis in humans. Consequently, treatment options remain limited. The advent of
methods to direct the formation of neurons from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells
(collectively hPSCs) provides unprecedented opportunities to both investigate how the function of human
neural circuits is subverted by neurological disease and screen for new therapies. A major step towards these
goals has been realized by the development of organoid culture techniques through which hPSC can be
directed to form spatially organized, brain-like structures. Thus far, brain organoids have been successfully
employed to model the impact of genetic mutations and environmental pathogens that result in overt defects in
brain growth. However, overall brain structure is preserved in most neurological disorders, and defects are
primarily defined by alterations in neural activities. Major challenges thus remain in developing means for
defining the organization and function of neural networks within organoids and using this approach to explore
underlying disease mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities. In our recent work, we discovered that
remarkably complex neural network activities can emerge through the creation of cortex-ganglionic eminence
fusion organoids, which permits the intermixing and functional coupling of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
Using a combination of calcium sensor imaging and electrophysiological approaches, we identified that fusion
organoids exhibit sustained multifrequency neural oscillations reminiscent of higher network functions seen in
intact brain samples and slice cultures. We further developed a fusion organoid model for the
neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome and found that organoids harboring mutations in the MECP2
gene exhibit markedly abnormal neural network activities including episodes of hypersynchronous bursting,
loss of low-to-mid frequency oscillatory rhythms, and abnormal appearance of epileptiform high frequency
oscillations. Together, these studies illustrate the extraordinary potential for the fusion organoid platform to
report both normal and dysfunctional neural network functions and recapitulate salient pathological features
seen in Rett patients such as seizures. Here, we seek to address three central questions for elucidating the
mechanisms underlying neural network dysfunction associated with Rett syndrome and other
neurodevelopmental disorders. First, does neural network dysfunction seen in Rett syndrome organoids
generated from patients harboring different mutations correlate with the nature of the mutation? Second, what
is the impact of cellular mosaicism in MECP2 function on neural network activities? Third, do organoid models
for different neurological diseases with a seizure component exhibit shared or distinct network dysfunction
profiles? Through our studies, we will explore how brain organoids can be best utilized to determine the root
causes of a range of human neuropathologies and work towards the goal of discovering new treatments."

 This project focuses on two themes: 1) elucidation of novel mechanisms that drive guanine nucleotide
binding (G)-protein signaling and tumorigenesis and 2) investigation of individual and coordinated roles of cell
adhesion proteins in regulating cell morphology, force transmission and cell motility. Our work on G-proteins is
centered on RAS and heterotrimeric G-proteins. Recent findings from our lab challenge a long-held dogma
in the field that oncogenic activation of G-proteins is primarily driven by defects in nucleotide cycling. However,
it is becoming increasingly clear that codon and residue specific activating mutations in G-proteins can drive
tumorigenesis by distinct mechanisms. In other words, not all activating mutations are created equal. We
propose studies aimed at understanding how residue specific activating mutations uniquely alter G-protein
structure, nucleotide cycling, protein recognition and signaling, that may be key to developing precision
medicine approaches to antagonize G-protein mediated tumorigenesis. Our lab has also uncovered novel
mechanisms of G-protein activation by post-translational modification and pH regulation. We propose highly
integrated multidisciplinary structural, biochemical and cell biology approaches to interrogate the role of these
novel posttranslational modifications in signaling and tumorigenesis. Our second theme is focused on the cell
adhesion proteins, vinculin and metavinculin. These cell adhesion proteins are isoforms that play a key role in
regulation of cell morphology, differentiation, force transmission and directed cell migration. We propose
studies to experimentally examine new models for vinculin and metavinculin-mediated filamentous actin
assembly and membrane insertion, conduct cellular studies to elucidate how metavinculin coordinately
regulates vinculin function, and elucidate how metavinculin cardiomyopathy mutations dysregulate contractile
force in heart disease. We will also investigate how vinculin and metavinculin engage filamentous actin in a
force dependent manner to regulate directed cell motility."
10837817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skin has a remarkable ability to heal wounds through re-epithelialization, a repair process fueled by
adult stem cells residing in the epidermis and hair follicles. Following injury, wound-edge
keratinocytes proliferate and migrate to initiate wound closure, which is accompanied by activation
and infiltration of immune cells. My long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular basis
underlying wound re-epithelialization, how the immune system regulates this process, and how it
affects tissue regeneration. Previously we found activation of the transcription factor Stat3 in
keratinocytes controls many important aspects of wound re-epithelialization, including basal
keratinocyte proliferation, migration and crosstalk with epidermal dendritic T cells (DETCs). However,
the molecular mechanism by which wounding triggers Stat3-mediated re-epithelialization and
activates the immune system remains unclear and is the subject of this study. Cellular injury is
known to produce damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are sensed by the innate
immune system for host protection. We hypothesize that DAMPs produced by skin wounds are
sensed by innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which then signal to produce
cytokines, and further activate Stat3 for wound re-epithelialization. Using a candidate approach and
Stat3 activation as a readout, we will first identify, characterize, and verify wound-edge cytokines that
influence wound re-epithelialization through epidermal-specific genetic knockouts, gene-expression
analysis, and genetic modulation of immune signaling (Aim 1). Next, we describe strategies to
identify the immune signaling pathway, upstream PRR, and the cells responsible for the PRR
signaling through genetic and biochemical approaches (Aim 2). Finally, we describe an inducible
genetic model of wound injury, characterize its similarity to physical wounding, and identify wound-
induced ligands using biochemical purification and an in vitro assay (Aim 3). These lines of
investigation will 1) offer novel insights into the molecular mechanism of wound initiation and innate
immune contribution to skin re-epithelialization, 2) contribute new tools and models to the study of
immune regulation and skin repair, and 3) improve our understanding and therapeutic options for
autoimmune/autoinflammatory skin conditions and diseases associated with poor wound repair. With
an exceptional mentoring team led by Dr. Elaine Fuchs (with Drs. Jean-Laurent Casanova and Daniel
Mucida) and a supportive, stimulating training environment at the Rockefeller University, I am ideally
positioned to fully develop my technical skills and knowledge in skin biology and immunology. My
research, training, and career development will allow me to establish a unique niche in the field of
wound-repair and tissue regeneration as an independent investigator.  "
10762256,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
While the promise of gene-based therapies for disabling neuromuscular diseases is finally becoming a reality,
research efforts thus far have primarily focused on gene replacement strategies for recessive, loss-of-function
disorders. Such strategies are not translatable to most dominant muscular dystrophies, hindering the
development of new treatment strategies.1,2 Our group recently identified mutations in DNAJB6 that cause limb
girdle muscular dystrophy D1 (LGMDD1), a dominantly inherited disabling myopathy with no current treatment
options.3 The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.
Addressing this unmet need will advance the field’s understanding of how to treat LGMDD1 and establish the
optimal approach to therapeutic development for other dominantly inherited disorders with complex,
heterogeneous disease mechanisms.1,2 Several lines of preliminary data indicate that mutations in DNAJB6
exert a dominant effect via a toxic gain-of-function.4,5 The potential for deleterious effects preclude a global
DNAJB6 knockdown strategy, as DNAJB6 knockout (KO) mice are embryonic lethal due to aggregation of
client proteins.6 Haploinsufficiency appears to be tolerated, as heterozygous KO mice are viable, with no
apparent skeletal muscle phenotype, and DNAJB6 frameshift and nonsense mutations are seen in healthy
“control” patients in genetic databases. We propose to selectively knockdown mutant DNAJB6 using silencing
RNA (siRNA). Our preliminary results indicate that allele specific knockdown (ASKD) is feasible and capable of
correcting a proteomic signature of LGMDD1 disease in vitro. Thus, our central hypothesis is that ASKD of
mutant DNAJB6 is a viable therapeutic approach to address the toxic gain-of-function mechanism of LGMDD1,
while avoiding complete knockdown. In this project we will validate that ASKD of mutant DNAJB6 improves
disease phenotypes in a LGMDD1 mouse model (Aim 1) and in vitro human LGMDD1 models (Aim 2). Finally,
we will optimize ASKD targeting a common DNAJB6 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to expand the
applicability of this therapy to multiple DNAJB6 mutations (Aim 3). We have generated a knock in LGMDD1
mouse with a heterozygous p.F90I mutation, orthologous to human p.F89I, and a FLAG-tagged wild type (WT)
allele, enabling size-based distinction of WT vs. mutant RNA and protein. We also generated induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), gene-corrected isogenic controls, and primary myoblast cultures from LGMDD1
patients. Successful completion of the proposed aims will produce essential preclinical data supporting the
therapeutic translation of ASKD for LGMDD1."
10763694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intestinal fungi, including Candida species, are normal components of the human intestinal microbiota that can
escape the intestinal niche and trigger autoimmunity or inflammatory disease. There is a significant knowledge
gap in the understanding of how fungi colonize the intestine and the factors that limit their colonization and
translocation across the intestinal barrier. The goal of this Program Project Grant (P01) is to identify factors that
regulate Candida intestinal colonization. Published and preliminary data from the Project Leaders suggest that
fungal, bacterial, and host factors all interact to regulate Candida colonization of the intestine. Dissection of these
complex interkingdom interactions requires in vivo experimental systems that allow for controlled manipulation
of fungal colonizers, the bacterial microbiota, and the host immune system. Gnotobiotic mouse models, involving
the use of germ-free mice, provide a platform for developing such experimental systems. The mission of the
Gnotobiotic Core is therefore to provide gnotobiotic mouse models to each of the three projects in this P01.
Germ-free mice will be used to create defined experimental models where we introduce a single bacterial or
fungal species, defined species mixtures, or complex communities transplanted from other experimental animals
or humans. Further, these experiments will be conducted in germ-free genetically modified mice to explore the
contributions of host factors. The Gnotobiotic Core builds on extensive existing gnotobiotic infrastructure and the
long-standing expertise of Core Leader Hooper’s lab in developing and using gnotobiotic models to study many
different aspects of host-microbiota interactions in the intestine. The Aims of the Gnotobiotic Core will be to 1)
provide germ-free or selectively colonized wild-type or mutant mice to test hypotheses about how the bacterial
microbiota regulates Candida colonization of the intestinal tract; and 2) derive additional germ-free immune-
deficient mouse strains to test hypotheses about how host immunity and its interactions with the bacterial
microbiome impact Candida colonization. Pursuit of these goals will allow us to build gnotobiotic mouse models
that enable experimental dissection of the fungal, bacterial, and host factors that regulate Candida colonization.
These studies in gnotobiotic mice will provide novel insights into interactions among intestinal fungi, bacteria,
and the host immune system, thus revealing fundamental principles about fungal colonization of the intestine."
10763697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis are major cause of infectious morbidity and mortality in premature
neonates, in patients with hematologic malignancies, and in organ transplant recipients. Our pilot studies reveal
that the GI tract harbors C. albicans and C. parapsilosis strains that expand and dominate the microbiota prior
to translocation into the bloodstream of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, despite receipt of
antifungal prophylaxis. Although the GI tract represents a major source of fungal bloodstream infections, the
molecular and cellular constituents of the intestinal immune system required to maintain colonization resistance
against Candida remain poorly defined. Our recent finding that specific C. albicans strains can colonize the GI
tract to intermediate levels in the absence of antibiotics represents an important advance to investigate this
question, because it enables us to explore the impact of host cellular and molecular constituents in the context
of an intact bacterial microbiota. Thus, we can compare colonization phenotypes and susceptibility to invasive
disease in experimental models with defined molecular and cellular lesions in host immune function, but with an
intact microbiota. To define essential immune-mediated mechanisms that limit Candida colonization, we
conducted in vivo screens of pattern recognition receptor pathways and host cellular requirements required for
this process. We found an essential requirement for TLR2/4, IL-1 receptor, and MyD88 signaling and for innate
lymphoid/NK cells to maintain Candida colonization resistance in otherwise unperturbed mice. In addition, we
have described a HIF-1/anti-microbial peptide circuit in intestinal epithelial cells that can regulate Candida
colonization in the murine intestinal tract. Based on these findings, we will explore the central hypothesis that
MyD88 and HIF-1 cooperate to couple recognition of the bacterial microbiota and tissue hypoxia to innate
lymphoid-natural killer cell and epithelial effector programs that limit Candida colonization and risk of invasive
disease. The aims will define (1) the precise role and essential cellular sources of TLR2/4, IL-1 receptor and
MyD88 signaling required for Ca and Cp colonization resistance, (2) characterize the functional requirements for
intercellular crosstalk among immune and epithelial cells, and (3) harness complementary immune activation
strategies to restrict Candida colonization, reduce the reduce the risk of systemic dissemination with immune
injury, and provide an experimental platform to interrogate fungal strain dynamics in the intestine. These studies
will incorporate C. albicans and C. parapsilosis mutants in morphogenesis and virulence factor expression in
collaboration with Project 1, will generate metabolomics datasets to inform studies in Project 3, and will work
closely with the Gnotobiotic Core to dissect the role of individual molecular and cellular determinants of
colonization resistance with and without the bacterial microbiota and with Mathematical Modeling Core to
develop and test predictive models of Candida strain dominance in the GI tract."

10877014,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is usually measured by the proportion of persons living with HIV
(PLWH) who are virologically suppressed on ART. However, the standards used to determine viral suppression
differ between the developed and the developing world. The developed countries define viral suppression as
viral load (VL) less than 50 copies per ml, while most of Africa, accepts the World Health Organization (WHO)
prescribed less than 1000 copies per ml as viral suppression in resource-limited settings (RLS). This has created
a category of persons in RLS with persistently low-level viremia (pLLV) of 50-999 copies/ml who are lumped
together with the truly virologically suppressed, and thus not given much attention. Since viral replication
continues during low-level viremia, this may fuel the proliferation of resistance mutations, expand the diversity of
viral strains and increase the viral reservoir size in those with pLLV. However, whether this population has more
diverse viral strains, has a larger reservoir size or serve as a source of the current rise in drug resistance in
Africa has not been studied.
This creates a critical knowledge gap which if not filled could derail the success of ART and serve as a bottleneck
in HIV cure efforts in Africa.
Our working hypothesis is that ART-treated PLWH with persistent low-level viremia have greater virus diversity,
larger reservoir size and select for drug resistance mutations. We intend to investigate this hypothesis with two
specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine viral diversity and drug resistance mutations among patients with pLLV. We hypothesize that
continuous viral replication during low-level viremia on ART expands the diversity of viral strains and fuel the
emergence of drug resistance mutations. First, we will perform a cross-sectional evaluation to determine the
frequency of clinically-relevant drug resistance mutations in those with pLLV. Second, we will follow the patients
with pLLV for 18 months to determine resistance evolution and the proportion of those who break through to
VL>1000. Third, we will determine inter- and intra-patient genetic diversity of HIV in those with pLLV.
Aim 2: Determine the characteristics of the HIV reservoir in HIV patients with pLLV. We hypothesize that
persistent low viremia feeds the latent reservoir making it larger and more diverse in those with pLLV compared
to the truly suppressed persons. The question here is whether pLLV enlarge the size of the reservoir and increase
clonal expansion. If that were the case, it would become more urgent to bring the virus to undetectable in these
patients.
The knowledge gained will be useful for our HIV control programs; may call for changes in treatment guidelines
in Ghana and Africa and prompt more extensive studies among persons with persistent low viremia in resource-
limited settings."
10768744,"In the US, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent the leading preventable cause of growth delay
and neurodevelopmental retardation in children. Currently, there are no readily available cures against
intended or accidental alcohol exposure during pregnancy and resulting FASD. This lack of therapeutic
countermeasures is largely attributed to the lack of a mechanistic understanding of FASD pathogenesis. While
prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) targets multiple tissue types and systems, the brain is the most severely
affected organ. Autopsy cases on human fetuses and infants with a history of PAE document abnormal
vascularization of the brain and hypoxic-ischemic neuronal changes or resolving brain hemorrhage. Work on
animal models demonstrates that PAE with maternal blood alcohol levels averaging 80-85 mg/dL dilates fetal
cerebral arteries in vivo independent of changes in systemic circulation, fetal heart function, blood-brain barrier,
blood pH, or pO2. The pathophysiological significance of dilated fetal cerebral arteries is expected to be
profound. First, an alcohol‐unrelated pathology, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, is characterized
clinically by morphological abnormalities of the child’s skull that result from a drop in cerebral blood velocity.
Remarkably, craniofacial malformations serve as the central diagnostic criteria for FASD in humans. Second,
alcohol-induced dilation of fetal cerebral arteries precedes the growth delay of exposed baboon fetuses. Third,
in ovine species, the largest neuronal loss in response to PAE is observed in brain areas that exhibit the
highest cerebrovascular alterations by alcohol. Altogether, clinical and experimental data suggest that changes
in fetal cerebral artery diameter may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of FASD. The extent of the fetal
cerebrovascular component contribution to the pathogenesis of FASD remains to be documented. As we
recently reported, alcohol-induced dilation of fetal baboon cerebral arteries in vitro is fully ablated by a cocktail
of blockers of the endocannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2). The current proposal will utilize a
baboon model to investigate the impact of fetal alcohol exposure by targeting the distinct components of the
eCB system on fetal cerebral artery diameter and fetal growth delay. In sub-aim 1.1, we will use in vitro
pressurized cerebral arteries from fetal baboons, selective pharmacological modulators, and mass
spectrometry of endogenously produced cannabinoids to test the hypothesis that alcohol-induced dilation of
fetal cerebral artery is mediated via distinct components of the eCB system. In sub-aim 1.2, we will use
pharmacological modulators of CB receptors, non-invasive Doppler ultrasonography in vivo, and liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomics to test the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of the
eCB system in vivo blunts alcohol-induced dilation of fetal cerebral arteries and diminishes the growth delay of
fetal skull, brain, and vascular tissue. Characterization of the mechanism(s) that govern fetal cerebral artery
responses to alcohol will pave the way for the development of therapeutics against consequences of PAE."

10768557,"Many community-dwelling persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) receive aggressive medical interventions within the last year of their life, despite the uncertainty about the benefit of such care to their quality of life or survival. Studies have raised concerns that such care may not be in alignment with patients’ goals and values and may even be associated with worse quality of care. These outcomes highlight the importance of ACP early within their disease course. Unfortunately, very few cognitively-impaired older adults actually participate in ACP while they still retain decision making capacity. As a result, there is growing recognition that improving goal-directed care for persons living with AD/ADRD or MCI will require greater focus on ACP early in the disease course.1,2 Patient portals can be an innovative way to engage patient’s in ACP outside of brief clinical visits that are already strained and allow for easy documentation of ACP wishes. Studies have shown that the use of portal-based ACP tools along with motivational electronic messaging is a practical and feasible way to improve engagement in ACP and documentation; but has been understudied within persons with AD/ADRD or MCI.3-8 The central hypothesis for this research proposal is that sending a user-friendly portal based ACP tool (ACPdSmart) coupled with motivational messages through the patient portal prior to a routine primary care visit will improve ACP reach and adoption among persons living with AD/ADRD or MCI. This will be accomplished with the following Specific Aims: (1) to conduct usability testing with a user-centered design approach among community-dwelling persons with AD/ADRD or MCI and their care partner to improve the user-friendliness of the ACPdSmart portal tool; (2) to pilot-test the ACPdSmart tool within the patient portal paired with a motivational message to improve ACP reach and adoption among community-dwelling persons with AD/ADRD or MCI; and (3) to evaluate acceptability, appropriateness, and implementation barriers of the ACPdSmart intervention among adopters and non-adopters. The PI will capitalize on an outstanding research environment and a mentorship team of experts in implementation science, clinical informatics, and qualitative analysis.

10768564,"Project Summary/Abstract
Extracellular ATP and ADP are mediators of purinergic signaling in cell-to-cell communication in virtually every
tissue. Autocrine and paracrine purinergic signaling contributes to normal cellular functions such as immune cell
chemotaxis and cell volume regulation, and purinergic signaling also contributes to pathology in injury, infection,
sepsis, and a number of diseases. Notably, extracellular ATP and ADP mediate purinergic signaling between
cells with both short-term and long-term effects. However, it has been a challenge to study the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which ATP and ADP control distinct signaling events because their levels are spatially
heterogeneous and purinergic signaling can vary significantly from cell-to-cell. Clearly, direct measurements of
extracellular nucleotides are needed, but current methods are not well adapted to measuring fluctuations in the
low extracellular nucleotide concentrations expected in live specimens. To overcome this barrier, we will use
protein engineering to develop high affinity cell-surface sensors that can be used to resolve the complex spatial
and temporal dynamics of ATP and ADP release, clearance, and purinergic receptor activation. To demonstrate
the application of our sensors and also guide their optimization, we will study neuron-glia purinergic signaling in
the brain. In particular, we will use our sensors to learn how metabolic state affects the function of microglia, the
resident immune cells in the brain, in regulating the regional purinergic dynamics that impact local neuronal
activity. The proposed series of multiplexed imaging studies that pair our purinergic sensors with sensors of
downstream signaling should directly visualize core elements of neuron-glia purinergic communication in an
integrated manner. This should provide valuable insight into novel mechanisms responsible for the coupling
between brain energy metabolism and excitability. Furthermore, the genetically-encoded tools developed
through this proposal should be broadly applicable to deeper study of any purinergic system."

ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect
and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for
accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic
high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision
and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center
for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent
Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in
human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also
includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST-
DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The
platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data
Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within
specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The
studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately
estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The
first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the
pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non-
human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after
acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay
protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor
variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific
confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma
on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in
vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and
progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using
machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations
for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4).
Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system
whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device."

10775313,"Healthcare workers represent a large and growing segment of the US workforce, and the strain of the COVID-
19 pandemic on the healthcare system has brought to light the significant stress, trauma, and burnout that
healthcare workers experience. These experiences may have lasting effects on healthcare workers’ substance
use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality, particularly among those in lower-wage occupations. These
workers often have fewer supports and resources, less autonomy in the workplace (e.g., scheduling/hours
worked, workload), and experience greater occupational hazards than their higher-earning counterparts yet
remain highly understudied. Most of the published studies related to substance use, mental health
symptomatology, and suicidality among healthcare workers have disproportionately focused on physicians and
other high-wage healthcare occupations. The objective of the proposed research is to examine the social and
environmental influences on the substance use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality of non-
prescriber/non-executive healthcare workers over time, with particular attention to the effects of moral injury (i.e.,
psychosocial and behavioral impacts of “failing to prevent or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held
moral beliefs and expectations”) and workplace policies, programs, and practices. The rationale for the proposed
research is that identification of factors beyond the individual level that confer risk or protection to healthcare
workers’ substance use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality can inform the development of more
effective prevention and intervention efforts, particularly as it relates to the implementation of psychosocially safe
and healthy workplace practices. Individual-level explanations for people’s risk and resilience to substance use,
mental health symptomatology, and suicidality remain dominant in the scientific literature. However, we will also
focus on interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal factors – and their intersections with
socioeconomic positioning – that affect the health, well-being, and risk for substance use, substance-related
harms, and substance use disorders among healthcare workers. This research proposes to 1) examine the
effects of moral injury on changes in substance use, substance use disorders, problematic mental health
symptomatology, and suicidality; 2) examine the impact of other individual, social, and environmental factors on
these outcomes over time; and 3) examine the unique impacts of workplace policies, programs, and practices
on the risk and resilience of healthcare workers. We will pursue these aims using an innovative approach and
unique focus. The proposed research will examine a diverse sample of healthcare workers recruited via social
media, including low-wage healthcare support occupations (e.g., nursing assistants, dietary aides, custodians).
The proposed research is significant because the examination of factors external to the individual will identify
modifiable social and environmental risk factors that are more efficient and effective intervention targets, given
the broad impacts of population-level interventions."

Mi-Jeong Lee, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Human Nutrition, Food and Animal Sciences, CTAHR
Higher mass of dysfunctional adipose tissues in obesity increases risk of metabolic diseases, a major public
health concern. Dietary factors are important regulators of adipose remodeling and systemic energy metabolism.
Lard-based high fat diets induce excessive remodeling of adipose tissues in animal models of obesity and
metabolic diseases. Depending on types of fat used, their effects on metabolic health vary and omega-3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acids enriched in fish oil have health benefits while saturated fatty acids impair insulin signaling
and induce proinflammatory responses. The objective of our work is to elucidate the molecular details and
mechanisms through which omega-3 vs. saturated fat exerts protective effects on adipose tissue function and
systemic metabolism. We will test a novel hypothesis that omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids lead to healthier
remodeling of adipose tissues through incorporation into membrane phospholipids altering membrane biology
and production of bioactive lipids. We will assess the importance of a phospholipid remodeling enzyme
lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) 3, which preferentially add poly-unsaturated fatty acids into
membrane phospholipids, in mediating the beneficial effects of omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The
proposed studies are expected to identify new strategies to improve adipose tissue function and hence, systemic
metabolic health."

Tuberculosis (TB) is second only to COVID-19 as the most lethal cause of death from a single infectious agent.
In 2020, an estimated 10 million people developed TB, nearly half a million of which were infected with drug-
resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). Early detection of infection and drug resistance is critical to controlling
DR-TB as this enables rapid engagement into effective care. Unfortunately, only 71% of newly diagnosed
TB patients are ever tested for rifampicin resistance, and even fewer receive more comprehensive testing.
Additionally, despite improved treatment success rates for DR-TB globally, these success rates do not reflect
upstream losses resulting from undiagnosed (missing cases) and untreated patients. Currently, bacterial culture
and nucleic acid testing remain the primary methods for diagnosing infection, with smear microscopy being
phased out. However, these methods present significant limitations for diagnosing drug resistance such as
lengthy time-to-result for phenotypic tests, as well as the need for a priori knowledge of resistance mutations and
prohibitive cost for molecular tests. Clearly, there remains a critical need for a fast, accurate, and cost-effective
DST, particularly for resource-limited settings. To address this, we propose to design and develop a rapid
phenotypic drug susceptibility test that can be easily adapted in TB endemic regions. The trehalose-
based DST, termed Tre-DST, is based on novel trehalose probes, which require metabolic conversion to emit
fluorescent signals, giving them their unique ability to specifically detect live Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb). Agnostic to mechanism(s) of drug resistance, Tre-DST can be used with all WHO-recommended DRTB
drugs, as well as any future TB drugs as a companion diagnostic. In Aim 1, we will develop, characterize,
and optimize a family of novel fluorescent trehalose probes (3HC-Tre and RMR-Tre) that are specifically
designed to improve performance over DMN-Tre and to distinguish live Mtb, making them ideal as biomarkers
of drug susceptibility. We will also evaluate probe specificity to TB and probe performance across a variety of
bacteria typically present in oral mucosa. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize Tre-DST as a multi-drug DST
for first- and second-line TB drugs. We will evaluate Tre-DST’s performance in accurately determining drug
resistance using drug susceptible and drug resistant Mtb strains, treated singly and in combination with the anti-
TB drugs that fulfill the WHO Target Product Profile (TPP) for next generation DST. We will also evaluate several
point-of-care (POC)-friendly detection methods to optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Lastly, in Aim 3,
we will perform preliminary evaluation using banked clinical isolates in Johannesburg, South Africa to assess
the performance of Tre-DST in the field. We will evaluate pre-validated readout methods in this clinical study,
benchmarking the performance of Tre-DST against bacterial culture."
10764295,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This randomized clinical trial will evaluate a novel, piloted, primary palliative care intervention that
addresses the lack of advance care planning and psychosocial needs commonly experienced by
patients with metastatic cancer.1-8 Up to half of adults with metastatic cancer report elevated anxiety or
depression (anx/dep),6,11,12 which can cause withdrawal from daily activities and future planning.13,14 The
intervention focuses on patients with elevated anx/dep symptoms—those with highest psychosocial needs who
may be at greatest risk for advance care planning non-completion. The intervention is founded on an evidence-
based intervention approach known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)11,12 that reduces distress
and promotes behavior change through theory-driven mechanisms. 13-17 In a single arm pilot study for adults
with metastatic cancer and elevated anx/dep symptoms, we leveraged ACT to design and refine the multi-
modal ACT intervention (M-ACT). M-ACT helps patients to live meaningfully and face the future no matter
what their health status, including completing advance care planning. In our single-arm pilot study,18 M-ACT
was highly rated by patients and was associated with significantly increased advance care planning completion
and sense of meaning, and decreased anx/dep symptoms and fear of dying. To increase scalability, M-ACT
uses a multi-modal delivery structure that integrates in-person group sessions with online sessions completed
at home. Group sessions connect patients to learn in-person together whereas online sessions expand on the
skills learned within groups, increasing intervention dose without increasing patient travel or healthcare
resource demands. In the proposed randomized trial, we will rigorously compare M-ACT to a usual care control
condition. We will also leverage the trial to assess the association between advance care planning and
anx/dep symptoms, thereby informing the critical practice question of whether anx/dep symptoms should be
addressed concurrently with advance care planning. The proposed study will enroll patients with Stage IV solid
tumor cancer (N=240) within the same community-based cancer care network as the pilot study, randomized
1:1 to M-ACT or usual care. We aim to: 1) Evaluate the hypothesis that M-ACT will increase advance care
planning completion (primary outcome) and sense of life meaning, and reduce anx/dep symptoms and fear of
dying relative to usual care control. 2) Assess the association between anx/dep symptoms and advance care
planning at baseline and over time, testing the hypothesis that decreases in anx/dep symptoms at post-
intervention will be associated with increases in advance care planning at follow-up. 3) Assess M-ACT's
hypothesized mechanisms to specify how the intervention works (exploratory aim). Given their advance care
planning and psychosocial needs, and poor access to palliative care, rigorously investigating M-ACT has the
potential to benefit community patients with metastatic cancer and to advance palliative care science by
addressing gaps in novel approaches, foundational knowledge, and the scalable delivery of palliative care.

10764297,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The overarching goal of this application is to identify the role of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in echovirus
entry and pathogenesis. We recently identified FcRn as a pan-echovirus receptor. We showed that gene editing
of FcRn resulted in reduced echovirus infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression promoted infection
in non-permissive cells. We also found that FcRn bound directly to echoviral particles and enhanced virus
attachment to cells. Consistent with these findings, recombinant FcRn protein or monoclonal antibodies to FcRn
blocked echovirus infection in multiple cell types. Finally, expression of the human homologue of FcRn rendered
neonatal mice permissive to E11 infection by the enteral route and showed that expression of the human, but
not mouse, homologue of FcRn restored echovirus infection in non-permissive cell types. However, the precise
role of FcRn in echovirus entry and a full analysis of the impact of FcRn on echovirus pathogenesis was not
explored. The studies proposed in this application will provide important insights into (1) the role of FcRn in
echovirus entry and trafficking in the intestinal epithelium, (2) the role of FcRn in the cell-type specific nature of
echovirus infections in the liver, and (3) the role of FcRn in echovirus pathogenesis. Our proposal pioneers
research into a variety of aspects of the molecular mechanisms of echovirus infections. Importantly, our
development of primary human and mouse stem cell-derived models of the intestinal epithelium, in vitro primary
cell-based liver models, and novel in vivo models of echovirus pathogenesis are highly innovative technical
advances that will allow us to directly assess the mechanistic basis for a number of aspects of echovirus entry
and pathogenesis in physiologically-relevant models. Given our extensive expertise in enterovirus research, we
are uniquely positioned to perform these studies, which will provide new paradigms for our understanding of
echovirus infections."

This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and dissemination of 3D electron microscopic
(3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy
biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). These samples were originally
collected, characterized and archived by neuropathologists R.D. Terry and N. Gonatas (at A. Einstein in the
1960’s), with later samples taken as part of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug infusion study involving S. Mirra (at
Emory in the 1980’s). They were re-examined by Ellisman, Masliah, Terry, and Mirra in the 1980s, using early
3D EM methods, and were found to manifest excellent preservation of ultrastructure, showing paired helical
filaments (PHF) and amyloid accumulations as well as modifications to subcellular organelles and cytoskeletons
of the cell bodies, axonal and dendritic processes. Here, we will exploit recent advances in high throughput,
automated 3D EM to massively scale the examination of these precious samples, reconstructing 100s of brain
cells with and without PHF, tracking axons (and mapping glia and synapses) through much greater brain volumes
than was feasible previously. Our goal is to target areas associated with both plaques and tangles, attending to
locations where existing findings suggest cell and network vulnerability and contain molecular interactions
suspected by some to underlie the initiation and progression of AD. Supporting investigations into the
progression of soma/dendritic degeneration, we will target cells operationally defined to represent a progression
of neuronal decline as seen in AD; determining the volume fraction of PHF in the cytoplasm as a practical staging
measure and linking this to the characterization of quantitative changes in the microstructure of major subcellular
constituents. Likewise, we will analyze the progression of axonal degeneration in and near plaques as data
obtained suggests that axons may become dystrophic before their parent cell bodies and their dendrites
degenerate."
10764301,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
It is critical to build biostatistics capacity in West Africa. Biomedical HIV research is growing in West Africa, but
biostatistical support and expertise are lagging. In collaborative HIV studies between West Africa and U.S.
institutions, the biostatistics leaders are almost always from the U.S. It is important to develop biostatistics
leaders in West Africa – biostatisticians who will not be technicians, but co-investigators, principal
investigators, and thought-leaders in funded HIV/AIDS research. There are several statistics PhD programs in
West Africa, but they often have little or no connection with biomedical research. Funded training initiatives
over the past ten years have been successful at building biostatistics in Southern Africa and East Africa, but no
such programs currently exist in West Africa.
 The Vanderbilt-Nigeria Biostatistics Training Program (VN-BioStat) builds on long-standing collaborations
between two leading research institutions in Nigeria and the United States, namely, Aminu Kano Teaching
Hospital (AKTH) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Vanderbilt) to establish a research and training
platform for biostatisticians doing HIV-related research in Nigeria. VN-BioStat will build upon the resources of
AKTH and its parent institution, Bayero University in Kano (BUK), to create a cohort of highly skilled Nigerian
biostatisticians with the capacity to lead and supervise biostatistical activities in West Africa. VN-BioStat
leverages the highly successful, collaborative and rapidly expanding portfolio of U.S. National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and other funded research at AKTH, with joint leadership from Vanderbilt investigators. To train
biostatistician leaders in Nigeria, the VN-BioStat program proposes to bring two Nigerian data scientists per
year (total of 10 over 5 years) to Vanderbilt to immerse them in biostatistics and to receive hands on training.
During the one-year training period, trainees will lead the design, analysis, and publication of a collaborative
research project using HIV data from AKTH. They will also lead a related, methodologically focused project
that will culminate in a publication. While at Vanderbilt, they will interact with a team of HIV biostatisticians,
take appropriate biostatistics courses (up to 8 credit hours per semester for 2 semesters), attend biostatistics
and global health seminars, participate in a grant-writing workshop, attend biostatistics clinics, and collaborate
with other Nigerian investigators. They will receive mentorship from Vanderbilt faculty (one biostatistician and
one clinical investigator) and AKTH faculty. We will also conduct annual workshops in Nigeria to provide mid-
level biostatistics training for up to 25 HIV researchers. Potential course topics include methods to address
missing data, introduction to causal inference, regression modeling strategies, big data in biomedical research,
and survival analysis."
10931376,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition affecting approximately 6.7 million people in the US aged 65 and older. Individuals with AD experience progressive memory loss and profound atrophy of the hippocampus, the seat of learning and memory in the central nervous system (CNS). Currently there is no cure for AD, and the percentage of affected US citizens is predicted to grow given our steadily aging population. Although neuronal death is prominent in AD, non-neuronal glial cells have been shown to be key players in AD pathogenesis, as they influence the microenvironment, provide metabolic support, and control inflammation. Nevertheless, the precise roles of different glial cell types in hippocampal aging and AD disease progression remain to be defined. Recent evidence indicates that a ubiquitous population of glial progenitor cells, termed oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) or NG2+ glia, control the extracellular matrix, engulf neuronal processes and present antigen through major histocompatibility complex I and II, and exhibit reactive behavior in disease, suggesting that they may modify the integration and survival of neurons in the brain. Although OPCs give rise to oligodendrocytes in the developing and adult CNS, they persist throughout life and may play important non-progenitor roles. Importantly, transcriptional analysis of OPCs indicate that they take on a unique molecular signature in AD; however, we have only a limited understanding of the impact of OPCs on neural circuit remodeling. An understanding of the mechanisms governing their role in promoting the integration and survival of neurons could reveal their unique role in neurodegeneration. To study the role of OPCs in circuit remodeling in the healthy and diseased brain, I plan to define the role of OPCs in two regions of neuronal integration that persist into adulthood: the stratum lucidum (SL) of the hippocampus (a key site of AD pathogenesis) and the olfactory bulb (OB). My preliminary analyses reveal that OPCs are denser and exhibit a unique morphology and transcriptional profile within the SL, where newly born dentate gyrus granule cells project their axons to area CA3, and within the OB, where neurons arriving from the rostral migratory stream integrate. These findings provide the motivation to explore the distinct features of OPCs in these regions and their involvement in circuit reorganization. I will test the central hypothesis that OPCs facilitate the integration of newly born neurons in the adult CNS and alter neuronal survival in AD. I will define the phenotype of OPCs in areas of active neuronal remodeling through in vivo imaging and scRNA-Seq; I will quantify the role of OPCs in circuit remodeling across aging, exercise, and neurodegeneration (specifically an AD mouse model); and I will genetically manipulate OPCs and determine the effect these manipulations have on neuronal integration. Through these studies, I hope to define the role of OPC-neuron interactions in structural remodeling of neurons in the mature CNS. Understanding the role of OPCs in the development and maintenance of neuronal connectivity could have important implications for brain development, repair, and survival of hippocampal neurons in AD."
10907516,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 4B3 (CMT4B3) is a rare, autosomal recessive hereditary
axonal neuropathy, often presenting with severe regression of developmental milestones during infancy
or early childhood. CMT4B3 has a wide clinical spectrum of symptoms. It ranges from an isolated
demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy to a complex neurodevelopmental phenotype with axonal
neuropathy, cranial nerve involvement, intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism. Most children
affected by CMT4B3 present with the severe phenotype. CMT4B3 is caused by mutations in the Sbf1
gene, resulting in disrupted function of the pseudo-inositol phosphatase, Myotubularin-Related Protein
5 (MTMR5). In this proposal, we focus on MTMR5, a developmentally important regulator of autophagy
and endo-lysosomal trafficking, and its involvement in proper axonal homeostasis.
 MTMR5 is known to catalytically regulate and dictate the subcellular localization of Myotubularin-
Related Protein 2 (MTMR2), an active phosphatase against phosphatidylinositol species. MTMR2 has
known roles in Schwann cell homeostasis and loss of MTMR2 leads to a demyelinating neuropathy.
MTMR5 was also identified as a neuron-specific suppressor of autophagy. Despite this knowledge, it
is entirely unknown how disrupted function of MTMR5 leads to axonal degeneration during early
childhood. Through the aims of this fellowship and using an established iPSC-derived motor neuron
model of CMT4B3, I seek to clarify the biochemical role of MTMR5 in motor neurons and how loss of
normal MTMR5 function results in axon degeneration early in development. In Aim 1 of this fellowship,
I propose to utilize an iPSC-derived motor neuron model of CMT4B3 to understand the effects of
MTMR5 loss on MTMR2, MTMR13, and phosphoinositide levels and discriminate if residual MTMR5
function causes toxicity in axons. In Aim 2, I seek to l gene expression profiling to characterize the
downstream defects as a result of MTMR5 loss, which likely stem from MTMR5’s role in autophagy and
endo-lysosomal trafficking. I plan to develop high-content image-based analyses to confirm expression
profiling results and to create a much needed platform for drug discovery and gene therapy validation.
 Fully understanding the mechanisms underlying CMT4B3 is critical to the NICHD mission. Such
knowledge is crucial for development and proper evaluation of therapeutic modalities that could help
CMT4B3 patients. With this perspective, the proposed project is tailored to my training towards
becoming a translational pediatric neurologist and scientist."
10898636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common, potentially lethal, monogenic
disease. Affecting 1:400 to 1:1000 people, mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 genes encoding polycystin-1 (PC1)
and polycystin-2, respectively, lead to development of fluid-filled cysts that progressively expand from renal
epithelial cells. This expansion damages surrounding kidney tissue, causing fibrosis, and leads to worsening
kidney function that ultimately requires dialysis or transplant. Half of the ADPKD population will experience renal
failure by the age of 50, and there are few treatment options to prevent such pathogenesis. These preventative
solutions are lacking due to limited understanding into the process of cystogenesis, meaning why cysts form and
what makes them worsen over time. Immune cells may contribute to this process. Prior literature has suggested
a role for macrophages in cyst initiation and expansion, and CD8+ T cells have recently emerged as exerting a
potential anti-cystogenic role. Using a novel transgenic suppression model of ADPKD in which a portion of the
C-terminal tail of PC1 is expressed, I will compare the immune cell populations present in a non-suppressed
disease model and the suppression model with non-cystic controls. I hypothesize that the differential immune
cell landscapes between disease models will reveal pro-cystogenic and anti-cystogenic factors that regulate
renal epithelial cells in ADPKD pathogenesis. With the expertise in ADPKD from the Caplan Lab and in
immunological investigation from the Craft Lab, I will investigate the role of immune cells in ADPKD pathogenesis
in murine models using in vivo interventional strategies, and analyze these models by flow cytometry,
immunofluorescence, and single-cell sequencing approaches. I seek to define immune cell signaling in ADPKD
and to elucidate the implications of this signaling for ADPKD pathogenesis, expecting to identify immune-
mediated factors implicated in cystogenesis. In addition to elucidating cellular signaling that modifies the cystic
and fibrotic manifestations of ADPKD, this proposal simultaneously aims to identify immune cell properties that
could serve as disease biomarkers and provide insight into treatment and monitoring strategies."

The Food for LifecOURse equity In maternal Security and Health (FLOURISH) Study uses a cross-cutting
research design that is widely-applicable to the prevention and treatment of many chronic co-morbidities that
disproportionately affect Indigenous women of childbearing age. Through intentional engagement with
community stakeholders across all project years, diverse perspectives will be integrated into the research
strategy and aims to ensure study findings are relevant, actionable, and yield the greatest potential for reducing
health inequities. Broadly, FLOURISH will elucidate nutritional and non-nutritional behavioral risk pathways
linking food insecurity to severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and related outcomes among Indigenous women
during pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period. A primary focus will be the impact of trauma on food
insecurity and health risk, as well as the rigorous evaluation and manipulation of dietary intake as an influential
pathway, with a special focus on dietary quality, chronic inflammation and dysglycemia. The study will be
conducted in Oklahoma, which is home to 39 of the federally-recognized Tribes that comprise the Southern
Plains region, in collaborative partnership with the Southern Plains Tribal Health Board. It is comprised of three
aims. First, the team will test and refine a conceptual integrated framework of food insecurity and SMM to identify
significant structural, social, behavioral, and biological pathways as candidate intervention points. This aim will
be accomplished through an observational study (n=350) of pregnant Indigenous women followed to 3-months
postpartum. Structural equation modeling will be used to test the study’s overall conceptual multi-level framework
of food insecurity and SMM. The final model will be refined through input with community stakeholders. Second,
the community-academic research team will develop the FLOURISH intervention, to be adapted from perinatal
food is medicine models used in non-Indigenous populations, with an emphasis on whole person health,
including stress management and self-care. The FLOURISH intervention will strategically address key nutrition
disparities and other health risk behaviors identified as significant path contributors to various drivers of SMM in
this specific population. This adaptation will be informed by findings from the first aim, and further refined and
finalized through a series of interviews groups with primiparous and multiparous Indigenous women with history
of SMM and various community care providers for this population (n=36). A series of focus groups with intended
users will solicit final feedback before the intervention is launched. Third, the research team will use a randomized
parallel group design (n=150) involving an additional external control comparison group to test the FLOURISH
and FLOURISH PLUS (including community healthcare workers) interventions to assess for feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary impact. Participants will be stratified by pre-pregnancy cardiometabolic risk (high
versus low). Primary outcomes include excess gestational weight gain with multiple secondary outcomes
(prenatal care, post-partum depression, stress, food security, dietary quality, inflammation, and hemoglobin A1c)."

The Community Partnerships and Engagement (CPE) component supports CIRCLE’s main themes of
commitment to a multi-system, multi-disciplinary, and bi-directional approach to translational science between
academia and Indigenous communities. The CIRCLE approach to community partnership and engagement
recognizes the unique experiences and legal status of Oklahoma’s Indigenous communities and builds directly
on our PCORI-funded engagement work through the Southern Plains Tribal Health Board. It also draws on the
broader community engagement resources of the Oklahoma Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute
(OCTSI). The CPE component’s primary goal is to directly connect the careers of researchers at our
institutions with the needs of Oklahoma’s Indigenous communities around the general theme of maternal
health and health equity. CIRCLE remains committed to the principle that research is most effective when
community partners are fully involved with all aspects of the work – from initially selecting and prioritizing
questions (as in those proposed here), to conducting the research, to disseminating and implementing findings.
Our approach to community engagement will enable CIRCLE to continue advancing its mission to build
authentic Indigenous community and tribal capacity for maternal health research. The CPE component is
responsible for achieving aim 1 of CIRCLE: Leverage existing partnerships with tribes and tribal health
stakeholders on patient-centered outcomes research and interventions to improve maternal outcomes.
The academic-community-tribal partnerships supported by this grant are designed to enable improved
maternal health and health care for Indigenous communities statewide and to grow the science of community
and tribal engagement nationwide. To achieve CIRCLE’s aim, the CPE component has three specific aims: 1)
Strengthen and expand our research partnerships with tribal community partners and health systems to
improve maternal health outcomes; 2) Grow effective capacity for community engagement for students,
postdoctoral scholars, faculty, and staff; and 3) Identify opportunities to align institutional policies and practices
with community priorities. The long-term sustainability of this effort will require durable structures for identifying
and responding to the needs of tribal and community partners working toward Indigenous maternal health
equity. By combining investments in bi-directional dialogues in maternal health, with specific support for
protocol development for CIRCLE investigators, and institutionalizing that in the operations of our institutions,
we see the current effort as an essential investment in a sustainable center of excellence in Indigenous
maternal health in the Southern Plains."

Indigenous communities. The TD component consists of four primary functions, including providing
opportunities for maternal health research education, support for mentorship, training and transitioning
maternal health researchers to be independent investigators, and developing and nurturing early career
scholars. The primary goal of the TD component is to support the research infrastructure required for
discovering sources of Indigenous maternal health disparities and translating science into solutions to eliminate
those inequities. The TD is responsible for achieving aims two and three of the CIRCLE, which are to: (2)
cultivate and support a multidisciplinary team of independent experts focused on discovering the bases for,
and solutions to, Indigenous maternal health disparities and (3) establish the foundation and initial processes
necessary to enable translational research and interventions focused on eliminating Indigenous maternal
health disparities. These aims will be achieved by accomplishing four specific corresponding aims, each
representing a major function of the TD. These include: 1) Launch an Indigenous maternal health education
and training online toolkit that provides a unified site to disseminate training opportunities, videos and
presentations, tip sheets and curated clinical evidence repository for patients, practitioners, investigators, and
research staff; 2) Ensure comprehensive support for the professional development and mentorship of maternal
heath investigators and practitioners; 3) Prepare early career investigators to be capable and committed to
community-engaged and translational research on Indigenous maternal health; and 4) Locate, support, and
nurture individuals from diverse backgrounds and disciplines to engage in maternal health research. Achieving
these aims is significant because they contribute to the development and sustainability of a research center
focused on Indigenous maternal health equity in the Southern Plains. There are no other research centers in
the U.S. with this focus; consequently, achieving our aims will fill a critical research gap for advancing public
health and clinical care. The TD component is also innovative as it will integrate personnel, resources, and
activities across multiple academic institutions spanning the state of Oklahoma, a comprehensive academic
healthcare system of hospitals, clinics, and centers of excellence, and close partnership with the Southern
Plains Tribal Health Board, the liaison between the National Indian Health Board and the 43 federally
recognized tribes in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, to achieve CIRCLE’s aims."

The broad goal of the New York Community-Hospital-Academic Maternal Health Equity Partnerships (NY-
CHAMP) is to upend the maternal healthcare ecosystem in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS) by
establishing a sustainable, highly collaborative infrastructure for community-centered maternal health science.
We have carefully co-designed, with our partners, a research, training, and community engagement agenda that
will 1) identify and address the comorbid biologic and psychologic pathways linking adverse social determinants
of health (SDoH) to disparities in SMM and MM; and 2) co-create and implement scalable multi-level strategies
grounded in anti-racism and empowerment to inform systems and policy change in our city and region. NY-
CHAMP is set against the compelling backdrop of persistently high rates and disparities in SMM/MM across
urban and rural parts of our state alike, despite a multitude of healthcare facilities and resources. More effective
partnerships that break down siloes and leverage the knowledge and strengths of our diverse communities,
hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies are essential to assuring equitable access to
culturally congruent, patient-centered care, redressing SMM/MM inequities, and maximizing our collective
impact. We convene Columbia University and Weill Cornell Medicine, four lead community organizations (Black
Women's Blueprint, Caribbean Women's Health Association, Northern Manhattan Perinatal Partnership, and
The Bridge), and a broad coalition of multisector actors to address 3 synergistic Overall Aims. In Aim 1, we will
implement a unified, community-driven research program that will: Project 1) Develop and implement novel
artificial intelligence risk prediction models and a resulting clinical decision support system for SMM, accounting
for SDoH, bias and fairness. Project 2) Conduct a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial of a novel
doula-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program holistically designed to address CV, MH, and SDoH
outcomes during postpartum; build trauma-informed and empowerment-based service delivery models; and
strengthen hospital-community care linkages. Project 3) Apply mixed methods to evaluate the effects of and
excess costs attributable to structural racism and SMM/MM and the mitigating effects of two policy interventions
for reducing maternal health disparities. In Aim 2, we will establish the Community Engagement and Policy
Action Core (CEPA) to serve as an enduring platform for iterative community input, co-design processes, and
research dissemination, capacity building, and policy action. In Aim 3, we will establish the Career Development
and Training Core (CDTC) to transform the maternal health research culture and pipeline of early-stage
investigators expertly trained in community partnerships, interdisciplinarity, anti-racism, and diversity, equity,
inclusion, and justice. Our vision is perfectly aligned with the priorities, needs, and assets of our communities
and with the NIH's IMPROVE initiative. Ultimately, NY-CHAMP will alter the underlying structural drivers of
SMM/MM in NYC and NYS and shift the scientific paradigm for excellence in maternal health research."
10908626,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most preventable maternal deaths occur in the intrapartum and immediate postpartum (PP) periods, as do
complications from undetected/undertreated mental health (MH) conditions (e.g., suicide, overdose) and
cardiovascular (CV) events. In New York City (NYC), maternal deaths are 8–12 times higher for Black than for
White birthing parents. However, most community-based programs addressing the health of birthing individuals
in this population have been narrowly focused on basic services (e.g., breastfeeding, social support), with limited
focus on evidence-based care. Holistic interventions addressing physical, mental, and social health needs in the
critical PP transition and moving from trauma- and “risk”-based to a strength- and empowerment-based approach
are urgently needed. Many hospital, community, and governmental barriers preclude broad adoption and scaling
of doula-delivered care, and it is not known how facilitators, assets, and resources can improve care continuity
and community-hospital linkages to support birthing individuals at diverse sites across NYC. The impact of doula-
led interventions at patient- and health-system levels have yet to be rigorously evaluated. In collaboration with
the Caribbean Women's Health Association and the Northern Manhattan Perinatal Partnership, we will address
these gaps by implementing and evaluating Living Healthy for Moms (LHMoms) in three complementary settings
and populations (Brooklyn, Queens, and Northern Manhattan). LHMoms is a novel integrated care intervention
that focuses intensively on care continuity and community-to-healthcare linkages that starts prior to discharge
and during the first 7 days post-discharge (PD) and extends into six months post-partum, as critical windows to
prevent long-term physical and mental health sequelae, while also addressing key determinants of lifelong health
risk. We have developed several innovative, evidence-based interventions, including an online education
empowerment program (using a Patient Activated Learning System platform we developed) to build patient self-
advocacy beginning in-hospital; a doula-led health emergency detection program during the critical first 7 days
PD; and a trauma-informed doula-delivered cognitive behavioral phone intervention to address PP depression
and cardiovascular risks for the critical six months following delivery. We propose a rigorous, mixed-methods
study of LHMoms to address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will test the effectiveness of LHMoms vs. attention
control in a Hybrid Type 1 Implementation Trial with 450 randomized birthing individuals at three hospital sites
in Brooklyn, Queens, and Northern Manhattan. This will include refining and tailoring the intervention to each
site to maximize care quality, building capacity for doulas to deliver LHMoms, and assessing effectiveness in
lowering PP depression, improving CV health, and creating better quality of life. In Aim 2, we will analyze the
effects of LHMoms on PP healthcare utilization and satisfaction. In Aim 3, we will examine the implementation
process and outcomes of the LHMoms intervention at the three sites. This project will advance the overall goals
of NY-CHAMP to optimize PP outcomes for historically disadvantaged birthing individuals."
10748372,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a critical illness arising from dysregulated host response to infection where invading pathogens elicit
an adverse systemic inflammatory response that affects multiple organs and tissues. Currently, there are limited
therapies that effectively treat this disease. The overarching goal of our work is to identify new molecular targets
that can potentially serve as diagnostics or therapeutics for prevention and treatment of sepsis. This project
focuses on glycocalyx shedding as not merely a consequence, but a critical cause, of inflammatory injury.
Specifically, we hypothesize that bacterial infection promotes disintegrin metalloprotease (ADAM) upregulation
and activity to shed glycocalyx molecules on endothelial surface and release their fragments into the circulation,
which act as inflammatory signals to mediate microcirculatory dysfunction and barrier leakage by triggering
endothelial cytoskeleton-junction responses. This novel concept will be tested by completing two aims: Aim 1 to
characterize the molecular property of glycocalyx shedding products and function in microvascular inflammation
during sepsis; Aim 2 to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of endothelial glycocalyx shedding and barrier injury.
We propose a multifaceted approach based on an innovative design that integrates peptidomics, proteomics and
nanotechnology with multispectral photoacoustic tomography, super-resolution confocal and 3D intravital
microscopic imaging. Functionally viable human lungs and microvessels serve as the primary models, which are
complemented by animal models and cell experiments. Microvascular barrier structure and function will be
examined in-depth at the organ, tissue and cell levels under pathophysiologically relevant conditions of bacterial
infection. We expect to gain novel insights that will not only fill the knowledge gaps in understanding the
molecular mechanisms of septic injury, but also contribute to the development of effective therapeutics against
infectious diseases. The proposed human organ studies further highlight the translational values of our work."
10748374,"Our efforts to forge principles for how GATA factors control development and function of the hematopoietic
system led to the discovery of conserved Gata2 enhancers (+9.5 and -77) essential for hematopoiesis and other
blood-regulatory enhancers. While genomic studies commonly predict enhancers, there were no reports of
enhancers essential for stem cell genesis or progenitor fate decisions. Strikingly, +9.5 mutations resemble
GATA2 coding mutations in causing human GATA2-deficiency syndrome involving immunodeficiency,
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). -77 disruption also causes MDS/AML.
This foundation led clinical centers to analyze -77 and +9.5 genetic variation. We discovered: 1) Whereas +9.5
and -77 confer progenitor cell fate, only +9.5 triggers hematopoietic stem cell genesis. 2) GATA2 loss with EVI1
upregulation is leukemogenic. 3) An ensemble of “+9.5-like” enhancers exist, including one regulating a c-Kit
facilitator that promotes erythrocyte regeneration and survival in severe anemia. 4) GATA2-regulated G-protein-
coupled receptor circuits control hematopoiesis. 5) We described gain-of-function (GOF) GATA2 mutants,
suggesting a paradigm-shift. 6) +9.5 single-nucleotide disease mutation dissociates developmental and
regenerative activities, creating a bone marrow failure predisposition. The disease mutations, innovative mouse
models, rescue assay and multiomics will enable the following aims. Aim 1 will determine how a blood
disease-causing enhancer establishes progenitor cell fate. -77-/- progenitors are defective in erythroid and
granulocytic differentiation, yet competent to generate macrophages. Our proteomic and single-cell
transcriptome data revealed that skewed differentiation involves upregulated interferon (IFN) response proteins.
We hypothesize that convergence of GATA2 and IFN mechanisms is critical in progenitor biology. We will
establish the -77-regulated transcriptome/proteome that controls progenitor fate and address key mechanistic
issues. Aim 2 will elucidate genetic determinants for the function of essential GATA2 enhancers. We
generated compound heterozygous (CH) enhancer mutant mice (-77+/-;+9.5+/-) and discovered that both
enhancers must reside on the same allele to regulate progenitor function. We are unaware of any example of a
dual enhancer requirement for progenitor function, the mechanisms may inform human +9.5 and -77
enhanceropathies, we will elucidate the mechanisms. Aim 3 will test models for how GATA2 human disease
mutants exert gain-of-function activity. We innovated a rigorous rescue assay in which restoring GATA2 in -
77-/- progenitors normalizes skewed differentiation and transcription. Mutants assumed to be loss-of-function
(LOF) surprisingly retained activity to rescue granulopoiesis and select target genes. We will test if all disease
mutants exhibit GOF activity, elucidate the mechanisms and determine if activities parse mutants into groups
that may ultimately inform clinical strategies. These studies will yield basic and translational insights into
mechanisms governing GATA factors, hematopoiesis and diverse blood diseases."

The Harvard-wide pediatric HSR Fellowship is a 30 year collaboration of Boston Children’s Hospital,
Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, and the Harvard Department of Population Medicine/Harvard
Pilgrim Healthcare Institute. This program has an amazing training record- the 154 alumni include 18
graduates from race/ethnicity groups underrepresented in medicine, 61 in leadership positions including 16
CMOs or Senior VPs, and four elected to the National Academy of Medicine. The curriculum is grounded in
rigorous child health services research training and in-depth implementation science training, aligned with
AHRQ learning health system (LHS) competencies. While our multisite collaborative leadership structure has
remained constant for two decades, our list of multidisciplinary, innovative faculty is updated regularly.
Pediatric HSR training programs are needed because critical epidemiologic, fiscal, and workforce differences,
such as a mental health crisis or a relative dearth of quality measures and interventions, set pediatrics apart
from adult medicine. Our overarching aim remains: to provide outstanding, comprehensive training across the
spectrum of pediatric health services research methods that both advances understanding of equitable health
and healthcare systems, and tests and evaluates implementation of novel approaches that demonstrably
improve child health. Toward this aim, the objectives for this fellowship are to: 1) recruit and retain diverse
candidates; 2) provide exemplary training in health services research and implementation science within LHS;
3) support our dedicated faculty; 4) continuously improve the training program and update the curriculum; and
5) continue to develop diverse graduates to lead the nation in innovative pediatric health services research,
including research that accelerates the development of LHS. To meet this goal, training focus areas include:
cutting edge and emerging methods in health systems research; application of implementation science and
related methods; LHS competencies including embedded research and health equity research within health
systems; and patient and family-centered research. The program will support 7 postdoctoral trainees per year
for the 2-year postdoctoral fellowship to create a critical mass of trainees across subspecialties, areas of
research, and methodological domains. In addition to conducting closely mentored research, each trainee will
complete coursework from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for core skills of biostatistics and
epidemiology and participate in advanced health services research methods training. Over the past 30 years,
our program has evolved in response to feedback from trainees, faculty, and our advisory board. In this cycle,
we will expand LHS training consistent with AHRQ’s new health equity and embedded research competencies
and add an alumni mentoring program. Renewal of our T32 Program will address a critical deficiency in the
pediatric subspecialist and generalist healthcare delivery system scientists that will foster the development and
success of learning healthcare systems to improve child health."

This is an application for the Emory Health Services Research Center Training Grant for postdoctoral trainees (MD
and PhD) at Emory University. The goal of this program is to train diverse candidates in the study of health
services research and health inequities, based on factors such as race/ethnicity, sex/gender, socioeconomic
status, geographical residence, healthcare access, and physical/mental disability, with a focus on the
underlying systemic, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms. A distinguishing feature of our program is the
utilization of a multidisciplinary approach to expose trainees to multiple methods and research areas, from
epidemiology and biostatistics to behavioral and social sciences, biological sciences, and health policy and
implementation. Each trainee has a primary mentor but works within a mentoring team with diverse expertise.
A maximum of 4 postdoctoral trainees will be in the program at any time point, each supported for 2 years.
Training will include multidisciplinary mentoring along with coursework, inter-departmental seminars, hands-on
research, grant writing and career development. Our main source of postdoctoral applicants will be split
between MD and PhD fellows. Postdoctoral fellows will be MDs pursuing a research career in health services,
or PhD graduates in epidemiology, health policy, health economics, or other relevant areas. Post-doctoral
trainees will have the opportunity to obtain an MS in Clinical Research or a Certificate in Clinical and
Translational Research and can select a personalized training pathway with didactic coursework,
supplemented with online trainings from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and other health system-
engaged experiences. The program will concentrate on successful training and career development, promoted
by solid collaborations among the Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, and the School of
Nursing. We will strive to appoint fellows from racial/ethnic minority groups and other underrepresented
groups. Our program responds to several emphasis areas for the AHRQ T32 program, including
multidisciplinary training, collaborative research, diversity of trainees, data sciences, translation research,
presentation skills, and project management, with strong emphasis on mentorship and career development.
Addressing health services inequities is a top priority of the strategic vision of the AHRQ. The ultimate goal of
this program is to prepare diverse individuals for leadership positions in health services research in order to
reduce inequalities in health care and health care systems."
10860966,"Project Summary
Innate behavioral responses to emotionally salient cues in the environment are thought to be set in the brain
through hardwired circuits. In mice, the olfactory detection and processing pathways are well characterized,
with olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express the same one odorant receptor (OR) coalescing to form
two glomeruli per olfactory bulb (OB). Mitral cells and tufted cells (M/TCs) send a single apical dendrite into
these glomeruli to receive input, and project their axons to various downstream brain regions. This highly
organized glomerular map is maintained throughout the mouse’s life. However, the olfactory bulb has a
developmental critical period from postnatal days 0 to 14 (P0 – P14), during which enrichment with a neutral
odorant produces lasting changes: both the volume of the glomeruli and responsiveness of M/TCs to the
enriched odorant increase. However, less is known about how critical period exposure to odorants with innate
valence alters OB circuits. A recent study has shown that exposure to the innately aversive odorant
phenethylamine (PEA) during the olfactory critical period produces behavioral changes and alters axon
projection patterns of OSNs expressing the trace-amine associated receptor class 4 (TAAR4 or T4). Mice
exposed to PEA during the critical period no longer show innate aversion to PEA in adulthood; furthermore,
these mice have on average five T4 glomeruli per hemisphere rather than the typical two. Currently, this is the
only report of changes in the OB circuitry and behaviors following exposure to an innately aversive odorant
during the olfactory critical period. What remains unknown is how either the OSNs or the M/TCs within the T4
glomerular module change in their PEA responsiveness following critical period PEA exposure. Additionally,
whether these behavioral and structural changes persist following complete OSN ablation and reinnervation of
the OB has yet to be investigated. To fill this gap in knowledge, I propose experiments to test the critical period
exposure to the aversive odorant PEA alters OB circuitry response patterns to produce persistent behavioral
and structural changes to elicit attraction to PEA. In Aim 1, I will first use 2-photon calcium imaging to identify
changes in OSN and MC/TC odor responses within the T4 glomerular module following critical period PEA
exposure. I will then determine whether critical period PEA exposure changes the intrinsic excitability of M/T
cells using whole cell voltage clamp electrophysiology in OB slices. In Aim 2, I will determine whether the
behavioral and glomerular organization changes elicited by critical period PEA exposure persist after OSN
ablation via methimazole (MMZ) treatment and subsequent reinnervation of the OB, using chronic in vivo
structural 2-photon imaging of T4 glomeruli and repeated odor preference testing in saline vs. MMZ treated
mice. These data will advance our understanding of the effects of critical period experience on neural circuit
development to produce lasting behavioral changes in mice."

Postpartum hemorrhage is a complication of childbirth that affects 3-8% of births in the United States, each
year this represents a minimum of 120,000 births. Postpartum hemorrhage is also a primary cause of maternal
mortality worldwide. Rates of severe postpartum hemorrhage and hemorrhage requiring invasive treatments or
blood transfusions are on the rise, particularly for labors that are induced. Severe hemorrhage is also more
common among women of color, contributing to disparities in maternal health. Oxytocin is a naturally occurring
hormone as well as a medication used to stimulate labor, prevent or treat postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin
binds available oxytocin receptors in uterine muscle, stimulating contraction. While oxytocin is the first-line
hemorrhage treatment, people who have been given oxytocin to stimulate contractions during labor are more
likely to have a less effective uterine contraction response to oxytocin administered postpartum, leading to
more bleeding and the need for other medical treatments or procedures. Currently, 4 of 10 people who
hemorrhaged, did so despite not having been identified as high risk by current clinical prediction tools. This
inaccuracy and the rising rates of hemorrhage indicate that more research is needed to help identify possible
risks for this potentially life-threatening complication. Because people with ineffective labor contractions or a
personal/family history (of hemorrhage) are more likely to have postpartum hemorrhage, the role of innate
oxytocin function/ sensitivity is the primary focus of this investigation. As such, our lab has been researching
biomarkers that can help identify people at risk for hemorrhage by testing how genetic and epigenetic variation
of the oxytocin receptor gene is associated with oxytocin response and hemorrhage. In this proposal, we use a
biosocial framework to test the central hypothesis that maternal variation in the oxytocin receptor gene can be
useful for predicting pharmacologic oxytocin needs and hemorrhage. First, we will examine DNA methylation
(epigenetic differences) from blood samples using banked data as well as prospectively collected non-invasive
salivary samples in association with oxytocin needs in labor and postpartum hemorrhage. Social determinants
of health will be examined in association with DNA methylation differences; evaluating the role of adverse
environments in shaping the oxytocin receptor epigenotype. Furthermore, we will test how DNA methylation
affects gene expression and the oxytocin receptor availability in uterine tissues. Second, we will examine
genetic variants of the oxytocin receptor gene in association with the clinical endpoints with the aforementioned
specimens and test pharmacologic response by measuring contractility of uterine muscle specimens. Given
that clinicians have no method of predicting how well oxytocin will work in the emergency of postpartum
hemorrhage, we aim to develop a clinically useful biomarker measuring intrinsic oxytocin sensitivity before
labor or birth occurs. The long-range goal of this project is to use biomarker data to improve clinical decision-
making, test personalized interventions and lower maternal morbidity."
10881940,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that will affect 1 in 26 Americans during their lifetime. There is
a range of severity, with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) being among the most
severe and medically challenging. DEEs are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by infant-
onset seizures that respond poorly to available treatments, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities,
developmental delay/intellectual disability, and elevated mortality risk. DEEs are primarily due to monogenic
variants that arise de novo in the affected child. Although each gene-based etiology is rare, collectively the
incidence of DEEs is estimated at 1 in 2,000 live births, representing a significant public health burden. Poor
response to available treatments is a defining feature of DEEs, representing a significant unmet need for
effective therapies. DEEs share overlapping clinical characteristics despite multiple genetic etiologies,
suggesting that disruption of final common pathways underlies these phenotypes. Identifying modifier genes
that broadly influence epilepsy penetrance and expressivity may reveal these shared pathways. Our
previous work showed that modifier genes often modulate function of multiple monogenic DEEs, and these
same genes are also implicated as risk genes in common epilepsies with complex genetic basis. In the
current study, we propose to identify modifier genes using a newly developed mouse model carrying the
human DEE variant KCNB1-p.G379R that was identified as a pathogenic variant associated with
developmental delay/intellectual disability, features of autism spectrum disorder, abnormalities in
background EEG, and multiple seizure types that responded poorly to available treatments. We recently
developed a Kcnb1G379R mouse model that recapitulates core aspects of the clinical phenotype, including
spontaneous recurrent seizures, abnormalities in background EEG, and altered neurobehavior. Phenotype
severity is dependent on strain background, suggesting a contribution of modifier genes. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that phenotype severity in the Kcnb1G379R DEE model is influenced by genetic
modifiers. We will address our central hypothesis in three subaims. First, we will ascertain seizure and EEG
phenotype severity in Kcnb1G379R mice on a diverse genetic panel using BxD recombinant inbred strains.
Second, we will catalog differences in gene expression between Kcnb1G379R and WT mice on the C57BL/6J
and [C57BL/6J]F1 strains. Third, we will integrate information from subaims 1A and 1B by perforning QTL
mapping and candidate gene analysis to identify modifier loci and putative candiate genes that influence
epilepsy severity. Advancing our understanding of the epilepsy gene network architecture for KCNB1-
associated DEE will promote development of targeted therapeutic interventions and has the potential to
benefit a broad population of individuals with DEE and other epilepsies."
10755689,"ABSTRACT:
Use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which causes near-total loss of testosterone, has increased
dramatically in elderly prostate cancer patients over the last decade. ADT is associated with a significant increase
in bone mineral density (BMD) loss (2-5% annually) and bone fractures, combined with a significant decrease in
skeletal muscle mass (2-5% annually) compared to age-matched prostate cancer patients not on ADT and men
without cancer. The loss of BMD and muscle mass results in a high prevalence of falls, reduced muscular
strength, and decreased balance. Despite the high incidence of ADT-related side effects, treatment options are
limited. Bisphosphonate therapy is commonly used for ADT-induced bone loss, but is associated with significant
side effects and poor compliance. Vitamin D protects against BMD loss and fractures, but its effects are strongly
dose-dependent. Current IOM recommended supplementation (600-800 IU/day) and serum 25-OH levels (20
ng/mL) are inadequate to protect against bone loss in a high risk population such as prostate cancer patients on
ADT. In addition, RCT interventions of 400-500 IU/day of vitamin D fail to prevent ADT-induced bone loss. High-
dose vitamin D supplementation (e.g., 50,000 IU/week) is a promising intervention that significantly increases
25-OH vitamin D to levels shown to improve BMD in other populations. Vitamin D has also been shown to
increase muscular strength, reduce falls, and improve balance. In preparation for this R01, we conducted a
Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of HDVD
versus placebo for 24 weeks in 59 prostate cancer patients receiving ADT (NCI R21CA185678; PI: Peppone).
Compelling evidence from our pilot study showed: 1) 50,000 IU/week of vitamin D (HDVD) was safe with no
increase in toxicity versus low-dose vitamin D, 2) compliance was excellent at 94%, and 3) HDVD significantly
increased 25-OH vitamin D levels. Those randomized to HDVD lost 1.9% BMD at the total hip versus 3.7% loss
in the placebo group (p=0.03). Stratified analyses showed the HDVD group lost 2.3% BMD at the total hip vs
7.1% for the placebo group for those with baseline vitamin D <27 ng/ml (p<0.01). Based on our preliminary data,
we propose to conduct a definitive, multi-center, phase III RCT in which 366 prostate cancer patients ≥65 years
old starting ADT with vitamin D <27 ng/ml will be randomized to 1) 50,000 IU/week vitamin D or 2) a matching
placebo for 52 weeks. All participants will receive a daily supplementation (800 IU vitamin D/1,000 mg calcium)
to ensure a minimum of 100% RDA. The primary outcomes is the change in BMD, while secondary outcomes
include changes in the clinically relevant outcomes of falls, balance, quality of life and fractures. We also plan to
explore the biological pathways of ADT-induced bone loss and response to HDVD using bone biomarkers. If
found to be efficacious, HDVD would be a safe, low-cost, widely-available OTC treatment that could revolutionize
management of ADT-induced bone loss and change clinical practice paradigms."
10756961,"Chronic clonal blood disorders such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and chronic phase (CP) chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) may over time transform, respectively, into secondary (s) acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and blast crisis (BC) CML, which are poorly responsive to currently available therapies, including
allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Thus, the availability of novel and more effective treatments is a true unmet
need for these patients.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that target messenger RNAs and regulate the corresponding
protein levels. MIR142, encoding miR-142, is a highly conserved “gene”, expressed at high levels in
hematopoietic cells and is involved in the development and function of myeloid, lymphoid and megakaryocyte-
erythroid progenitors. MIR142 has been found mutated and/or downregulated both in lymphoma and AML.
Furthermore, miR-142 knock-out (KO) causes impaired hematopoiesis in zebra fish and mice, with expansion of
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and decreased hematopoietic output.
We recently demonstrated that miR-142 KO in mouse models with clonal myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs;
i.e., FLT3-ITD+ MPN or CP CML) prompts transformation into an AML-like disease and confers a significantly
shorter survival to these animals. Our data support a role of miR-142 deficit in deregulation of the metabolism of
clonal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), with a switch to higher levels of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) via
increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO); these changes likely play a key role in the transformation of clonal HSCs
into leukemic stem cells (LSCs). We demonstrated that rescue of miR-142 deficit with a novel miR-142 mimic
compound (CpG-M-miR-142) reduced OxPhos levels and viability of LSCs, decreased LSC burden and activity
and prolonged survival of treated BC CML mice. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of miR-142 downregulation and its impact on the
transformation of clonal MPD into aggressive AML-like disease will allow us to design and optimize novel
treatments to compensate for the miR-142 deficit and prevent and cure MPD transformation. We propose the
following Specific Aims (SAs): SA#1: To define the role of miR-142 deficit in the sAML/BC CML transformation.

of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) embedding a strategically developed, sustainable center 
infrastructure that cultivates cutting-edge research focused on the role of metabolic dysregulation in cancer 
development and progression. The Administrative Core provides critical scientific and administrative leadership 
to advance the goals of the CCM: to develop and sustain a thematically focused multidisciplinary center 
infrastructure dedicated to defining the role of altered metabolism in the development and treatment of cancer 
and to use this innovative center structure to develop promising early-stage investigators with enhanced cancer 
research skills. The goal of the Administrative Core is to increase the scientific productivity of the center’s faculty 
by delivering efficient administrative services across scientific projects and cores as well as pilot projects through 
an organizational / leadership framework that supports flexible team-based mentoring and provides for clear 
accountability. The Administrative Core is the central coordinating hub responsible for integrating highly 
complementary disciplinary strengths at UK in cancer, metabolism and informatics and leveraging sophisticated 
metabolomics tools and advanced cancer imaging capabilities in support of data-intensive research focused on 
cancer metabolism. The core has primary responsibility for facilitating the CCM’s scientific vision, operating on 
principles grounded in transformational leadership and shared administrative oversight. Administrative Core 
functions are operationalized through the following 3 specific aims: 1) to provide overall operational management 
of the center; 2) to facilitate research training, mentoring and career development activities to develop early- 
stage investigators in cancer and metabolism and expand research in this area through pilot projects; and 3) to 
conduct overall planning and evaluation of CCM activities and resources. The core implements all administrative 
activities of the CCM: oversees daily center activities; manages program communications, fiscal processes, 
meeting organization and advisory committee input; facilitates and expedites interactions among projects and 
cores; manages the pilot project program; and leads program and project evaluation efforts. The core oversees 
a total of 4 projects, 2 scientific cores, a biostatistics and bioinformatics support component that is integrated 
into each project and 4 pilot projects each year. In addition, the core ensures highly effective, well-planned team- 
based mentorship, including basic and clinical perspectives and external expertise, for early-stage investigators. 
The core supports CCM investigators through their career development milestones including tenure and

Identifying the appropriate clinical target volume (CTV) to capture microscopic disease is the greatest limitation
in clinical radiotherapy in efforts to offer maximally conformal treatment to minimize radiation associated
toxicity. The challenge of defining the CTV comes from inherent uncertainty in the tumor spread beyond the
visible gross tumor volume (GTV). Delineation of the CTV is a laborious manual process. Furthermore, there
exists a practical disconnect between CTV contouring and the subsequent treatment plan dose optimization.
Exploration of the real tradeoff between covering malignancy with the dose effective for tumor control and
delivering potentially toxic dose to surrounding healthy tissues is currently impossible. The broad long-term
goal of this project is to make CTV definition easier and better. We will focus on two challenging disease sites,
glioma and sarcoma. Our methods can be generalized to essentially all other disease sites. The first aim is to
automate CTV definition. This will be accomplished by machine learning of barrier structures and anatomic
domains that are known to affect the spread of tumor beyond the visible GTV. The CTV will be expanded in 3D
taking the preferred direction of spread in the different anatomic domains (such as spread along muscle fibers)
into account. The second aim is to develop a user interface that lets the user interact with the automatic CTV
definition system, to avoid a black box impression. The user can edit the auto generated contour if necessary.
Any changes will be logged and used to retrain the system. The CTV expansion will be integrated in a multi-
criteria optimization system for treatment planning, where the user can interactively explore the dosimetric
impact of CTV expansion on the dose coverage of the tumor and dose burden in normal structures. In the third
aim we will test the hypotheses that this system will lead to a more consistent definition of the CTV, better time
efficiency, and better treatment plans leading to provable improvements of the expected clinical outcome. We
will make the system available as a standalone system to academic users and hospitals."
10764320,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
For more than 15 years, the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (IHV-Nigeria or IHVN) has partnered with
the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland Baltimore (IHV-UMB) to train Nigerian
researchers both locally and in the US. This has resulted in 51 Masters and PhD-holders engaged in HIV
research and leadership careers at IHVN’s International Research Center of Excellence (IRCE) and at
collaborating universities and institutions throughout Nigeria. IRCE was established in 2015 to drive IHV-
Nigeria’s research mission: to increase the volume, quality, and capacity for research in Nigeria and West
Africa. To harness their prior training and exponentially increase their impact, it is imperative to mature these
early (trained) investigators into independent (skilled) investigators. In addition, it is important for Nigerian
public health programs that implementers and policymakers have complementary program evaluation and
knowledge translation skills, to address HIV and other health priorities and gaps. The focus of this submission
is to expand local expertise in responding to Nigeria’s HIV epidemic by addressing research leadership gaps
among investigators, and program evaluation and knowledge translation gaps among implementers and
policymakers.
The proposed Expanding the Pool of Independent Investigators in Implementation Science in Nigeria
through HIV research training (EXPAND Nigeria) has four specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To launch a 12-
month, implementation science design-integrated HIV research training curriculum at IRCE, delivered on a
hybrid virtual and in-person platform. Specific Aim 2: To mentor and develop a cohort of five early career
MD and/or PhD-holding scientists trained with the Aim 1 curriculum, to compete for independent research
funding that addresses HIV research priorities relevant to Nigeria. Specific Aim 3: To transition skilled early
career investigators from Aim 2 into active and productive research positions at IRCE and collaborating
academic and public health institutions in Nigeria. Specific Aim 4: Using the hard skills subset of modules
from the Aim 1 curriculum, to provide short-term, six-month training for a multidisciplinary cohort of 40
program implementers and policymakers, to design and conduct priority HIV program evaluations and
translate findings into policy and practice.
Outcomes of the proposal include a scalable training curriculum addressing local research capacity and skills
gaps; skilled researchers in a supportive environment that launches and keeps them in a research trajectory;
and institutional research leadership successfully transitioned from IHV-UMB to IHV-Nigeria, with IHV-UMB
remaining as a long-term training and research partner."
10764325,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a growing epidemic, and in the absence of effective
treatment, disease burden increases as the population ages. In both ADRD and mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), there is significant temporal variability in disease progression, increasing the difficulty for managing
patient comfort and safety. Early detection of symptomatic states and continuous monitoring are regarded
as effective measures to minimize the impact of the disease as various forms of intervention can provide
opportunities for treatment, compensation and coping. However, current clinic-based cognitive and
behavioral assessments have numerous shortcomings; they are largely non-quantitative and clinicians
often have difficulty determining if there has been significant changes in neurologic condition between
visits. Additionally, assessments are obtained infrequently, and do not objectively account for
disease-related behaviors that could be revealed in daily activities. In this project, we propose to advance
new computational approaches and analytics to identify digital biomarkers for ADRD detection, prediction
and monitoring outside the clinic. This technology-driven approach is based on sensor data passively
acquired from commodity smartphones and wearables, and provides the foundation for a novel embedded
assessment of cognitive status through continuous monitoring.This proposal presents several research
opportunities. Firstly, we will advance passive and continuous data collection methods using multimodal
sensing. Challenges we will address include optimizing battery use for long-term data capture, and
mitigating privacy concerns by performing on-device data and feature pre-processing. Secondly, we will be
building on state-of-the-art research techniques in behavior and context recognition, speech analysis, and
machine learning to identify digital biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. We will
leverage these biomarkers to build computational models for disease stage characterization and
prediction, and individualize them by incorporating race and ethnicity risk factors as priors. Lastly, to
facilitate the use of these models and digital biomarkers in clinical practice, we will advance a novel visual
analytics interface towards helping physicians and health practitioners interact with the acquired sensor
data, validate the digital biomarkers, verify model results, and forecast the progression of disease.
 RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 A clear and specific clinical need motivates this proposal: improved and continuous understanding,
 monitoring, characterization, assessment and prediction of a prevalent neuro-cognitive condition in
 naturalistic settings. ADRDs are difficult and costly diseases to treat, affecting millions of people in the U.S
 alone. Our approach provides the foundation for a new direction in the early detection and prediction of this
 devastating and highly-debilitating condition."
10764327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Skill acquisition can be facilitated by social experience, usually through exposure to a conspecific performing a
well-defined behavior. In fact, social learning (SL) is pivotal to the acquisition of many core behaviors, including
aural communication. Although the neural bases for auditory SL remain uncertain, one plausible hypothesis is
that social experience may induce experience-dependent plasticity in auditory cortex (AC), as found for many
forms of learning, thereby facilitating auditory task acquisition. Social learning may also have implications for
developmental hearing loss (HL), a prevalent sensory impairment that is associated with persistent deficits in
speech and language acquisition, especially since social factors are thought to facilitate language acquisition in
children with HL. Three Aims test predictions that emerge from this hypothesis: Aim 1 first demonstrates the
positive impact of SL on task learning: Naïve Observer gerbils receive five days of exposure to a trained
Demonstrator performing an amplitude modulation rate discrimination task. An opaque divider separates
Observer and Demonstrator, such that visual cues are absent. Observer gerbils are then permitted to practice
the auditory task, and the rate of learning assessed. To test the prediction that AC activity is required, AC will
be inactivated during social experience. Aim 1 will go on to test the prediction that dopaminergic
neuromodulation within AC is be necessary for social learning. We will first determine whether dopamine is
released in AC during social experience, using fiber photometry and a genetically expressed dopamine sensor.
We will then block dopamine receptors in AC during social exposure to determine whether the benefits of
social experience are diminished. Aim 2 tests the prediction that AC neuron sensitivity to auditory cues will be
enhanced during SL. Gerbils will be instrumented with electrode arrays in AC, and recorded during five days of
social exposure. Single neuron and population responses to auditory task stimuli will be assessed to determine
if improved neural sensitivity during observation can explain the rate of task acquisition rate during practice. To
test the contribution of an auditory social cue (i.e., Demonstrator vocalizations), recordings will be obtained
from Observers exposed to auditory task cues plus playback of demonstrator vocalizations. Aim 3 tests the
prediction that SL will improve task acquisition in hearing loss-reared animals. Juvenile gerbils will receive
either permanent (malleus removal) or transient (earplugs) conductive HL. Animals will then be instrumented
with electrode arrays in AC, and assessed as in Aim 2. Innovations in this proposal are to: (i) extend current
auditory learning paradigms to include social cues, (ii) use wireless recordings during learning to make within-
animal comparisons of neural and behavioral sensitivity, and (iii) shift the current emphasis in HL research
from a focus on degraded sensory processing to one that considers how social factors may facilitate auditory
skills. If successful, the project will identify a CNS mechanism that mediates socially-enhanced auditory
learning, and provide a novel approach to remediate sensory and cognitive barriers in children with HL."
10764332,"ABSTRACT
The single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) is the founding member of the nineteen-partner SSB interactome. There is
a fundamental gap in understanding the mechanism of action of the interactome, the first prokaryotic family of
oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold (OB-fold) genome guardians identified. The continued existence of this gap
represents an important problem because, until it is filled, a complete and clear understanding of genome stability will be
lacking. This understanding is crucial as defects in OB-fold genome guardian family members have disastrous consequences
for genome stability. In higher organisms, mutations in the three OB-folds of BRCA2 ultimately result in cancer, and the
proposed studies are therefore directly relevant to human disease. Consequently, the long-term goal is to understand the
molecular mechanism of the SSB interactome. The main objective of this proposal is to understand how SSB interacts with,
and regulates, several partner proteins and itself, to maintain genome integrity. The central hypothesis is that two regions
of SSB known as the linker and the OB-fold, (present in both SSB and interactome partners), are the key elements to all
aspects of protein function. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known how SSB physically and
functionally interacts with both itself and its partners, a clearer understanding of the events required to maintain genome
integrity, mediated by this OB-fold family of genome guardians, will be obtained. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing two specific aims: 1) determine the role of the linker/OB-fold network in SSB function; and 2) determine the
mechanism of action of the SSB interactome. Under the first aim, a combination of in vivo and in vitro binding assays,
HDX-MS, protein crystallography, cryo-EM, and single-molecule biochemistry will be used to determine whether the
linker/OB-fold interface is the primary means of SSB-partner binding. Under the second aim, enzyme kinetics, genetics,
real-time super-resolution microscopy, and single-molecule biochemistry will be used to understand how the linker/OB-
fold network mediates SSB interactome function in the dynamic reactions of DNA replication, recombination, and repair.
The proposed research is innovative because of the combinatorial strategy taken, the novel single-molecule approaches
used, and the care that we will take in elucidating SSB interactome function using full-length proteins. The proposed
research is significant because it will allow, for the first time, the development of a clear picture of SSB interactome function
in DNA metabolism and the maintenance of genome integrity."

Children with severe respiratory and cardiopulmonary illness who need out-of-hospital (prehospital) emergency
care are vulnerable to error and preventable harm. Improving prehospital patient safety for children is a national
research priority. Video-consultation with pediatric experts on telemedicine platforms (expert teleconsultation) is
a promising intervention that has produced safer care for children in hospitals and narrowed gaps in access for
underserved communities. However, the potential safety benefits of expert teleconsultation remain largely
untapped by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems. Studies demonstrating efficacy of pediatric
applications are urgently needed to improve EMS technology adoption. This R03 application builds on skills,
experience, and pilot data from Dr. Boyle’s K23 award to compete for a future R01 award to support her transition
to research independence as a clinician scientist conducting prehospital trials. To prepare for a future efficacy
trial, Dr. Boyle worked with EMS providers to design a low-cost mobile platform for use in ambulances and adapt
a simulation model to assess the technical performance of prehospital teams in high-risk pediatric transports and
measure the effects of interventions on patient safety outcomes. She conducted a pilot simulation-based
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test intervention acceptability, feasibility and estimate statistical parameters
for the future R01 efficacy trial. This work identified two gaps that must be addressed before progressing to the
larger trial. First, the primary assessment tool lacked accuracy as it measured harm indirectly via performance,
so needed further adaptation. Second, teleconsultants had relevant expertise but used unstructured
communication which lessened intervention fidelity. This R03 application leverages existing K23 pilot RCT video-
recordings and qualitative data to (1) adapt and validate the simulation performance checklist to measure serious
safety events, a clinically important patient centered outcome, and (2) refine intervention training to standardize
communication processes in prehospital teleconsultation encounters. In Aim 1, the study team will use a modified
Delphi process with expert consensus to develop a safety event checklist and apply it to K23 video-recordings
to gather validity evidence to support its use in the future trial. In Aim 2, the team will test the feasibility of using
a tool to measure intervention fidelity and combine this with qualitative K23 stakeholder feedback to refine the
intervention training protocol to standardize communication processes. This R03 will produce the necessary
measurement tools and standardized intervention training to compete for a future R01 award that tests the
efficacy of teleconsultation to reduce harm in children who require prehospital emergency care, a national
research priority."
10786124,"The actin-based stereociliary bundle (or hair bundle) on the apex of auditory hair cells serves the critical
function of converting sound energy to electric signals. Defects in hair bundle development and maintenance
due to genetic and environmental factors are a leading cause for sensorineural deafness. A long-term objective
of this work is to gain a mechanistic understanding of hair bundle morphogenesis programs, including secreted
morphogens and their downstream signaling effectors and cytoskeletal regulators. Formation of the V-shaped
hair bundle is integrally linked to planar polarization of the hair cell apical cytoskeleton, which is initiated by the
peripheral migration of the kinocilium, the hair cell primary cilium. Recent advances demonstrate that hair cell
intrinsic planar polarity, which we name iPCP to be concise, is regulated by several planar polarized, cell-
intrinsic signaling modules and microtubule motors. At the tissue-level, the non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell
Polarity (PCP) pathway aligns hair cell orientation along the medial-lateral (or neural-abneural) axis of the
cochlear duct. While disrupted tissue-level PCP signaling causes hair bundle misoriention, defective iPCP
signaling results in both misoriented and misshapen hair bundles with a mispositioned kinocilium. Despite its
importance for hair bundle morphogenesis, how iPCP is regulated by developmental signals and how iPCP
and PCP signaling are integrated remain poorly understood. To fill these knowledge gaps, this application
leverages our recent exciting discoveries and aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which a novel Wnt/G
protein signaling pathway coordinately controls iPCP and PCP during hair bundle morphogenesis. While
Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP pathways have been extensively studied, little is known about the in vivo function
and mechanisms of Wnt/G protein signaling.
Our aims are built on a strong foundation of preliminary data, showing that Wnt ligands secreted by the
cochlear epithelium activate heterotrimeric G protein and PI3K signaling to control both iPCP and PCP. We
have identified genes required for G protein activation in the cochlea, providing clues to the molecular
mechanism. We propose to use gain- and loss-of-function alleles in vivo, ex vivo cochlear explants and cell
culture studies in vitro to define critical components of the Wnt/G protein pathway and its integration with the
Wnt/PCP pathway. In Aim 1, we will delineate the signal transduction machinery of the Wnt/G protein pathway
by determining the roles of specific Wnt ligand, Frizzled receptors and downstream signal transducers. In Aim
2, we investigate the role of the iPCP component Par3 in Wnt-induced G protein activation. In Aim 3, we will
test whether Wnt/G protein signaling is regulated by multiple G protein GEFs during cochlear morphogenesis.
Ultimately, insights into this new Wnt signaling pathway may facilitate devising rational therapies to stimulate
hair bundle repair following injury and to regenerate auditory hair cells through stem cell technologies."
10786139,"Alternative splicing of the Cacna1b gene generates a number of functionally different voltage gated CaV2.2 calcium channel isoforms. CaV2.2 controls neurotransmitter release at nociceptor terminals in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is a key therapeutic target of analgesics used to treat neuropathic pain. CaV2.2 inhibitors are analgesic but their therapeutic effectiveness is complicated by the lack of broad efficacy, narrow therapeutic window, off target actions and addiction. In nociceptors, cell-specific alternative splicing of CaV2.2 pre-mRNA generates isoforms that have different sensitivities to morphine. Normal splicing of CaV2.2 is disrupted in nociceptors following peripheral nerve injury, contributing to the well documented loss of morphine efficacy in neuropathic pain. In preliminary experiments, the applicant shows that epigenetic modification of genomic DNA controls the cell-specific expression of an alternatively spliced exon in the Cacna1b gene in nociceptors. This modification of genomic DNA is altered after nerve injury leading to abnormal alternative splicing. The applicant proposes that this is a key alteration underlying the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. In this proposal, he plans to expand on his studies to identify genome-wide nociceptor-specific alternative splicing events that are disrupted in an animal model of neuropathic pain. The applicant will generate high-resolution, genome-wide RNA-seq datasets to identify nociceptor-specific splice isoforms. Additionally, he will determine epigenetic modifications of DNA that associated with and control alternative splicing. He will further demonstrate how these are altered in nociceptors after nerve injury applying the techniques of whole genome bisulfite sequencing and ChIP-seq. He will use these datasets to determine events that lead to aberrant alternative splicing in nociceptors and, as a consequence, inform strategies to correct deficits in alternative splicing to treat neuropathic pain. The applicant long-term career goal is to become an independent scientist in academia focusing his research in how transcriptome-epigenetic interactions drives cell-specific gene expression in neurons and how they are disrupted in diseases such chronic pain. To achieve these goals, he will undertake extensive training in bioinformatic and computational analysis of large data sets. This new training will complement his background in patch-clamp electrophysiology, cellular and molecular biology and behavioral analyses. The Brown University environment combined with proposed mentors and consultants provides the best path for his scientific growth and career development. This training grant will allow the applicant to bridge different research areas to understand cell-specific processing and be a competitive and interdisciplinary investigator."
10783187,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication among critically ill children and is independently associated
with increased morbidity and mortality. While AKI identification remains largely reactive, early prediction of AKI
provides opportunities for mitigation strategies to improve patient outcomes. Existing pediatric AKI risk
prediction models are primarily driven by single-center data with limited translation into clinical decision support
(CDS) at the point of care. While CDS systems are designed to improve care quality and patient safety, they
have failed to make meaningful improvements while contributing substantially to provider alert fatigue. This is
especially true in pediatric critical care, where alerts and alarms are ubiquitous and often ignored. Disregarding
important alerts may lead to patient harm. The addition of machine learning methods to augment decision
support has been the focus of substantial hype, however clinicians remain skeptical over concerns such as
utility, credibility, and validity. Within this clinical context, this application addresses two specific knowledge
gaps. First, without validated and generalizable prediction tools, the best method for identifying patients at risk
for developing AKI in the pediatric ICU (PICU) is unknown. Second, current CDS systems are burdensome and
there exist no clear recommendations on useful, usable implementations for AKI decision support. The long-
term goal of my research program is to improve the care and outcomes of critically ill children with acute kidney
injury while reducing provider alert frustration through personalized, shareable CDS. As a step toward this
goal, this career development award will demonstrate success of an integrated CDS pipeline for external
validation, cutting-edge technology to facilitate distributed implementation, and usability assessment. The
research aims of this proposal are to: 1) establish baseline external validity of an existing AKI prediction model
and extend with new predictors to improve accuracy within two novel multi-center datasets, each with >80,000
PICU encounters; 2) overcome interoperability barriers using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource
(FHIR)-based EHR technology and prospectively evaluate this implementation’s performance; and 3)
implement principles of user-centered design to improve clinician acceptance. With the support of my
mentoring committee, I will gain advanced knowledge and develop expertise in user-centered design,
qualitative methodology, clinical trial design, and implementation science in decision support. This work is
innovative as it leverages two brand-new, highly granular datasets to achieve external validation, implements
an AKI prediction tool using new FHIR-based technology, and utilizes mixed-methods cognitive informatics
tools to perform usability testing. However, the truly innovative aspect of this work is the integration of all three
aims into a single pipeline. This work provides the foundation for a prospective clinical trial evaluating clinical
effectiveness, as well as incorporation of biomarkers and physiologic data streams, and the development of
evaluation measures for decision support systems."
10783196,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Red cell disorders affect more than 1 billion people worldwide, are a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality and lead to a substantial economic burden. These disorders can result from a decrease in survival or
in production (or both). Our research is focused on erythropoiesis and how this process goes awry in disorders
such as Diamond Blackfan anemia (SCD), sickle cell disease (SCD) and anemia of inflammation. Our work has
highlighted differences between neonatal and adult human erythropoiesis and used these findings to reveal the
mechanism of steroid resistance in DBA. In parallel, we studied the mechanism of action of immunomodulatory
drugs during erythropoiesis and how they increase fetal hemoglobin production in SCD. We recently identified
the nature of the erythroblastic island in normal erythropoiesis and under inflammatory conditions. Together,
these discoveries have allowed for a better understanding of normal and disordered erythropoiesis.
 Nevertheless, critical basic and translational questions remain in DBA and SCD. The proposed research
program builds upon Dr. Blanc’s productive research track record to determine (i) why the erythropoietic defect
in DBA manifests after birth, (ii) how the erythroblastic island in the bone marrow contributes to the
pathophysiology of DBA and SCD and (iii) identifying new targets and treatments for DBA and SCD.
 To answer these questions, we propose an ambitious research program divided into three projects. The
first will investigate the impact of differential regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle length in fetal versus
adult erythropoiesis. The second will address the contribution of the newly characterized erythromyeloblastic
island to the pathophysiology of DBA and SCD and the third will focus on identifying and testing new drugs for
the treatment of these two hematologic disorders.
 As a whole this program should (i) offer new models to study ribosomal protein biology relevant to heart
and blood disorders, (ii) explain how the erythroid niche universally contributes to inflammation in hematologic
disorders and (iii) offer new therapies for the treatment of bone marrow failure syndromes and sickle cell disease."
10783523,"Project Summary: The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic, yet, at the same time, highly organized
network of protein filaments, the most important being actin and microtubules (MTs). MTs are essential for
defining cellular shape and structure, as well as trafficking membrane-bound vesicles, organelles, and, during
cell division, chromosomes. To perform these functions, the cell must tightly regulate the formation of new MTs
via the process of MT nucleation. Cells primarily regulate MT nucleation by controlling the universal MT nucleator,
the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC). To initiate MT nucleation, γ-TuRC is recruited to specialized regions known
as MT organizing centers (MTOCs), where γ-TuRC is activated and spatially oriented so that the resulting MT
has the appropriate polarity. Many of the first discovered MTOCs are also the most complex, including the basal
body, which generates flagellar MTs, and the centrosome, which generates many spindle MTs. These classical
MTOCs are composed of up to hundreds of unique proteins organized into complicated large-scale structures.
This makes them poorly suited to uncover MTOC function: namely, how MTOCs recruit, orient, and activate
γ-TuRC. To will illuminate these three basic principles by investigating γ-TuRC regulation in two model essential,
yet simple MTOCs: in the K99 phase, the vertebrate MT branch site and, in the R00 phase, the nuclear plaque
of model excavate Trypanosoma brucei. I will use a combination of reconstitution experiments and cryo-electron
tomography to uncover how these divergent, model MTOCs use shared principles to regulate γ-TuRC. My results
will both help the research community understand MTOC function, as well as provide new therapeutic avenues
to treat infection by parasitic excavates, an emerging global health threat.
 As proposed, this research plan will allow me to successfully pivot from my postdoctoral work with Dr. Petry,
an expert on vertebrate MT nucleation, to establish my own, independent research focus on excavate MT
nucleation and launch as an independent investigator. In addition, I have established a mentor team for the K99
phase of the proposal to train me in key technical areas that I require for the independent R00 phase. First, I will
master a TIRF-based assay pioneered in Dr. Petry’s lab that allows visualization of microtubule nucleation at the
single molecule level. Second, which I will learn cryo-electron tomography, a key technique of my proposal, in
collaboration with world experts Dr. Andreas Hoenger and Dr. Martin Beck. In learning this technique, I will
benefit from my mentorship team of Dr. Petry, Dr. Hoenger, Dr. Beck, and the cutting-edge vibrant structural
biology community at Princeton as a whole. Finally, I have recruited Dr. Chris de Graffenried, an expert in
excavate biology, to serve as a scientific mentor as I transition into this new model system. Through the training
phase of the proposal and beyond, I will learn from my mentor team how to successfully lead a research group
that fearlessly leverages a broad range of techniques and disciplines to answer critical scientific questions, and
will, in the R00 phase, establish this group at a leading U.S. institution."
10777252,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Recent FDA accelerated approvals of two anti-amyloid antibody treatments, aducanumab and lecanemab, for
early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) provide the first disease-modifying treatments to date, albeit with moderate
slowing of cognitive decline, and vascular side effects known as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities due to
edema (ARIA-E) or microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in ~12-35% of patients, especially ApoE4 carriers. While the
cause of ARIA is unknown, it has been suggested that Ab clearance by anti-amyloid antibodies is mediated by
perivascular drainage which may transiently lead to amyloid accumulating in the blood vessel wall and inducing
inflammation, which in turn may increase BBB breakdown, leading to edema or microhemorrhages (Cogswell et
al., 2022). Therefore, there is still a large unmet need to improve cognitive efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid
immunotherapy. Semaglutide is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, that is FDA approved
for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and obesity, that has strong anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and
pro-vascular health effects. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of semaglutide in stroke models,
diabetes models, LPS models and other disease models. Novo Nordisk, the inventor of semaglutide, is
conducting two large Phase 3a clinical trials to test the efficacy of semaglutide in early-stage AD (EVOKE,
EVOKE+). While other GLP-1R agonists have shown benefits in AD mouse models, semaglutide, a longer lasting
form, has not yet been tested in amyloid AD mouse models. The goal of this project is to determine whether the
combination of semaglutide with anti-amyloid antibody therapy will enhance the efficacy beyond that of either
treatment alone and attenuate the vascular side effects seen with anti-amyloid antibodies. We propose the
following 3 Aims: 1. We hypothesize that semaglutide alone will reduce or reverse inflammation and
neurodegeneration and spare cognition in 2 amyloid AD-like mouse models: 5XE4 mice which overexpress
human mutant APP/PS1 on a human ApoE4/4 background and APPSAA knockin mice which express physiologic
levels of human mutant APP. Mice will be dosed for 12 weeks at 2 ages – pre-plaque and after robust plaque
and vascular amyloid accumulation. 2. We hypothesize that combination therapy with semaglutide and anti-
amyloid antibodies (murine versions of lecanemab and donanemab) will enhance efficacy compared to either
treatment alone in the 5XE4 model which develops abundant plaques, vascular amyloid, inflammation and
cognitive decline with aging. 3. We hypothesize that acute semaglutide co-treatment with a murine precursor to
bapineuzumab (3D6) shown to cause a high amount of ARIA, will mitigate microhemorrhagic side effects in aged
5XE4 mice. Outcomes include behavioral testing, pathological and biochemical measures, bulk RNAseq and in-
depth analysis of transcriptomic changes within cell populations in cortex and hippocampus, and mapping of the
mouse data to human data available on the NIH-sponsored AMP-AD portal. If successful, combination trials in
humans could be initiated to improve the efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid antibody immunotherapy."
10757402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Less than 8% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients are alive 5 years after diagnosis. PDAC is
typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting treatment options. Chemotherapies are the mainstay for ad-
vanced PDAC, though they produce incomplete responses. Thus, development of novel therapies for PDAC
patients is urgently needed. A possible explanation for failure of standard chemotherapies in PDAC is cellular
phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors. Heterogeneity may enable subpopulations of cells to survive therapy
and repopulate the tumor. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been described in multiple solid tumor types.
CSCs have robust proliferative potential and are typically resistant to cancer therapies. Elimination or re-differ-
entiation of cancer stem-like cells is an attractive strategy: By homogenizing cancer cell phenotypes within tu-
mors, such therapies may suppress tumor progression and lead to improved responses to conventional thera-
pies. Our pilot data suggest that secreted Wnt ligands produced by one cancer cell subpopulation drive a stem-
like state in another cancer cell subpopulation, in essence forming a specialized microenvironment, or niche,
within pancreatic tumors that maintains CSCs. We found that CSCs express Wnt target gene Lgr5, whereas
niche cells are marked by Porcupine, an enzyme that post-translationally modifies Wnt. Hypothesis: Disrupting
CSC and niche cells can translate into novel therapeutic strategies for PDAC patients. We propose to identify
mechanisms that drive Lgr5+ CSC and Porcupine+ niche cell states and to explore the potential of Wnt inhibi-
tors in PDAC therapy. These studies have the potential to translate into new PDAC therapies. Aim 1. Interro-
gate function of Lgr5+ stem-like PDAC cells. We will profile Lgr5+ pancreatic cancer cells and evaluate ability
to functionally contribute to PDAC progression, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. We will perform
lineage-tracing and -ablation, and gene expression and proteomic profiling of Lgr5+ cells in genetically engi-
neered mouse PDAC tumors. Results will determine whether Lgr5+ cells are CSCs in established tumors and
inform their molecular characteristics, which may provide added means to target these cells. Aim 2. Elucidate
biology of Porcupine+ PDAC niche cells. We will identify molecular mechanisms that drive Porcupine+ niche
cell state. We will use Porcupine reporter allele to ablate these cells in PDAC to evaluate role in tumor progres-
sion, and isolate niche cells for proteomic and gene expression profiling. Results will provide insights into role
of Porcupine+ cells in PDAC progression and how to target them. Aim 3. Therapeutically target Wnt signaling
in PDAC. We will target Wnt signaling by using small molecule inhibitors of Porcupine as single agents and in
combination with chemotherapy. To improve delivery of these drugs into desmoplastic PDAC tumors, we will
complex them with cyclodextrin carrier molecules. These therapies will be tested in orthotopic mouse and pa-
tient-derived xenograft models of PDAC in RNF43 wild-type and mutant PDAC. These efforts will test thera-
peutic potential of Wnt inhibitors in PDAC, which may sensitize pancreatic tumors to chemotherapy."
10757403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breathing after birth requires coordinated development of the airway epithelium and its surrounding
mesenchyme and mesothelium. In the fetus, these tissues form in response to exogenous forces from fluid
pressure within and around the developing lungs that is normally high in the lumen of the airways, thus
generating a positive transpulmonary pressure. The mechanical environment of the fetal chest cavity is
disrupted by conditions such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which reduces or reverses the
pressure across the developing lungs and leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, a major cause of neonatal mortality.
Although several biochemical signals, including retinoic acid (RA), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
CDH, the mechanical forces and signaling downstream of transpulmonary pressure that regulate lung
development are unknown. Our preliminary and published data suggest that transpulmonary pressure itself
regulates the RA-biosynthesis pathway, airway epithelial branching morphogenesis, and airway smooth
muscle differentiation. Here, we propose to take advantage of our innovative microfluidic platforms, tissue-
specific knockout mice, fluorescent reporter mice, and mouse models of CDH to uncover the molecular
mechanisms that connect pressure, RA signaling, and morphogenesis and differentiation within the embryonic
lung. We will combine these approaches with time-lapse imaging of lung explants, single-cell transcriptomic
analysis, and real-time fluorescent force sensors. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that pressure
activates the mechanosensor Yap in a tissue-specific manner to regulate the spatiotemporal pattern of
expression of genes involved in the RA-biosynthesis pathway. In Specific Aim 2, we will uncover the effects of
pressure and tissue-specific synthesis of RA on airway epithelial growth and morphogenesis and airway
smooth muscle differentiation. In Specific Aim 3, we will measure the relative effects of pressure and RA
signaling on tension, strain, and fluidity within the epithelium, mesenchyme, and mesothelium. This work will,
for the first time, identify the tissue-specific mechanical forces and molecular signaling downstream of
transpulmonary pressure that regulate early morphogenesis of the lung. We expect that our findings will
suggest novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of defects in lung development."

models of remediation. Reading disabilities- word level (i.e., dyslexia) reading disabilities associated with oral
language difficulties are important educational and public health concerns. Previous foundational work has
demonstrated the importance of collecting early screening data on both language and literacy skills to make
robust predictions of reading and language risk. Empirical data suggest that combining multiple variables
including known early predictors of reading achievement may improve predictive power and have better
longitudinal stability. Further, it is possible that the inclusion of contextual community factors may enhance our

Benzene is a prominent volatile organic compound (VOCs) that is present in water, food, paint,
detergents, vehicle exhaust, tobacco smoke, and e-cigarette vapors. Exposure to low doses of
environmental benzene in urban areas has been implicated in increasing the risk for metabolic
dysfunction across all ages. However, a direct link between exposure to low-dose benzene and
metabolic homeostasis is not yet established. Using the limited available literature on
environmental exposure to benzene and its metabolic outcomes, we performed a preliminary
meta-analysis and found a positive association between exposure to benzene and metabolic
impairments. Our preliminary studies provide strong evidence that chronic exposure to benzene
at varying low doses, modeling human exposure routes, induces significant insulin resistance
and hyperglycemia in rodents. Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as one of the causal
factors in the pathology of metabolic diseases. Glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) have recently
garnered specific attention for their role in neuroinflammatory responses in metabolic disorders.
Microglia, produce various pro-inflammatory molecules that are critical for the development of
peripheral metabolic imbalance and insulin resistance via hypothalamic inflammation. We show
that benzene exposure at several low doses relevant to occupational and environmental
exposure promotes robust hypothalamic glial activation and elevation in the hypothalamic
inflammatory IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway followed by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress response. Our central hypothesis is that benzene-induced changes in microglial
function and IKKβ/NF-κB signaling underlie changes in whole-body glucose homeostasis and
metabolic responses. This hypothesis will be assessed with a novel murine model of air-pollution
combining molecular, genetic, and physiological approaches designed to manipulate both the
number and the inflammatory activation state of resident microglia in the following Specific
Aims: 1) To determine the contribution of exposure to low benzene concentrations to
neuroinflammation and metabolic regulation; 2) To determine the role of central IKKβ/NF-κB
inflammatory mechanism in a benzene-induced metabolic imbalance: 3) To determine the cellular
and molecular interplay between microglia neuroinflammation and ER stress response triggered
by benzene exposure. The proposed research will, for the first time, directly assess the role of
benzene-induced changes in glial function and inflammatory signaling in regulating whole-body
metabolism. Such a study will be of importance for shaping public health policy regarding
benzene exposure and its role in predisposition to develop metabolic diseases."
10762994,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cell nucleus is bi-directionally transported and positioned in a cell cycle specific manner, a process that is
important for cell cycle control as well as brain and muscle development. The importance of nuclear positioning
for brain and muscle development is underscored by the fact that human disease mutations of proteins
engaged in the transport of the nucleus cause severe brain and muscle development diseases, including
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinal muscular atrophy, which is the
most common genetic cause of death in infants. Yet, it is unknown how teams of opposing motor complexes
collaborate to achieve correct timing, directionality and velocity of transport. Notably, the interactions of
opposing motors with cargoes have not been characterized by biochemical or structural methods as proposed
here. The nuclear pore complex protein Nup358 provides recruitment sites at the nuclear envelope for the
opposing motor complexes dynein and kinesin-1, which can bind simultaneously and facilitate bi-directional
positioning of the nucleus along microtubules. This pathway is important for faithful chromosome segregation
and essential for a fundamental process in brain development that is required for brain progenitor cells to
differentiate to neurons and other cell types. Dynein adapters such as Bicaudal D2 (BicD2) have key roles in
transport, as they select cargoes and are required to activate dynein for processive motility; however, the
underlying molecular mechanism is unknown.
We plan: 1) To establish how dynein motility is modulated by dynein adapter/cargo complexes and by kinesin-
1. 2) to establish a structural basis for recognition of the cell nucleus as cargo by dynein adapters. 3) To
establish whether dynein and kinesin-1 are recruited in a cooperative manner to Nup358 at the nucleus, i.e.
whether binding of the first motor changes the affinity for the second motor. We plan to establish how
BicD2/cargo complexes activate dynein for processive motility. Furthermore we plan to assess how kinesin-1
modulates motility of the dynein/BicD2/Nup358 complex.
Our approach combines NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and biophysical methods, which are
integrated with single-molecule processivity assays with intact dynein and kinesin-1 motors. Results will
establish a structural basis for cargo selection by BicD2. Our study serves as a model system to understand
how cargo adapters regulate the motility and directionality of cargo transported bi-directionally by both dynein
and kinesin-1, which is important as these motors facilitate a vast number of cellular transport events that are
essential for chromosome segregation, signal transmission at synapses, brain and muscle development. More
specifically, results will establish how correctly timed bi-directional transport of the nucleus is regulated, which
is crucial for cell cycle control, muscle and brain development. Mutations of proteins of these pathways cause
devastating neuromuscular diseases, and results will help devise therapies for these diseases."
10762999,"Gene editing is a promising strategy for treating or even permanently curing genetic diseases. In
particular, a new technique called prime editing has the potential to make small targeted
insertions, deletions, and substitutions with very high potential coverage of known disease-
causing mutations, and while minimizing dangerous double-stranded breaks in DNA. In order to
realize this potential, robust delivery strategies must be developed to deliver prime editing tools
efficiently to disease-relevant organs. One such delivery strategy is lipid nanoparticle delivery of
RNA and/or protein-based prime editing components. LNPs are nonviral, nontoxic, and clinically
validated delivery tools. However, there is an extremely diverse space of possible LNPs, with
tens of thousands of potential lipid structures that may be useful for LNP delivery. Selecting the
best possible LNP for a prime editing application, therefore, is challenging because in vitro
testing is often unreliable and in vivo testing of one LNP at a time is extremely low throughput.
Here, we propose to combine two scalable techniques to generate and test safe, potent LNP
formulations for performing prime editing. First, we will employ combinatorial chemistry
techniques to generate large libraries of biodegradable lipids for inclusion into LNPs. Second,
we will introduce a new technique which we term pegRNA barcoding to screen dozens to
hundreds of LNPs for successful prime editing in a single mouse. We will employ this technique
to identify the best biodegradable LNPs for editing of multiple organs, including in particular the
lung and the liver. Having identified the top candidates, we will proceed to use our LNPs to
apply prime editing to treat mouse models of two different inherited genetic diseases: hereditary
tyrosinemia type I (HTI), a liver disease, and cystic fibrosis (CF), primarily a lung disease. We
will evaluate the efficiency of prime editing, the levels of undesired editing events, and
phenotypic correction of these mice. The results may identify promising preclinical candidates
for the treatment of HTI, CF, and many other lung and liver diseases."

Parasitic nematodes infect over 1.5 billion humans. Control of this poverty-associated global health burden relies
almost entirely on the administration of a small number of anthelmintic drugs. The prospects of anthelmintic
resistance and the sub-optimal nature of these drugs in many nematode parasites demand new approaches to
parasite treatment and control. However, the need to develop new antiparasitic treatment options is hampered
by large gaps in our basic knowledge of the nematode biological processes that promote the establishment and
maintenance of infection. Excretory-secretory (ES) products released by parasitic nematodes into their host
environments are essential for host immune modulation and successful parasitism. Despite the general under-
standing that the ES system is a conduit for the release of molecules (proteins and vesicles) that promote parasite
survival, we have a poor understanding of the underlying structure and function of the ES apparatus in medically
important parasitic nematodes. To address this gap in knowledge, this project will identify regulators of secretory
function in Brugia malayi, a mosquito-transmitted ﬁlarial nematode and causative agent of human lymphatic ﬁlar-
iasis (LF). Recent studies in B. malayi, including on the mode of action of ivermectin, support the premise that
the ES apparatus is a lucrative and unexploited source of new therapeutic targets. Our overarching hypothesis
is that cell-surface receptors localized to the B. malayi ES system directly or indirectly control parasite secretory
function, and that they can be targeted to interfere with the release of ES-derived molecules. We will pursue
three aims, motivated by preliminary receptor leads and made feasible by innovative methods we have optimized
to resolve the transcriptomic state of the B.malayi ES system and to proﬁle receptors implicated in parasite se-
cretory function. We focus our efforts on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are proliﬁc drug targets
and known to be expressed in nematode ES cells and adjacent cell types that may act on the ES system. In
Aim 1, we will use innovative spatial transcriptomics approaches to resolve the transcriptome of the B. malayi
ES region across intra-host stages and to identify candidate GPCRs that regulate ES function. In Aim 2, we will
use reverse genetics and chemical approaches to assess the role of ES-localized GPCRs in the regulation of
B. malayi secretory function. In Aim 3, we will use whole-organism model nematode and mammalian single-cell
heterologous expression platforms to deﬁne the pharmacology of ES-localized GPCRs and to establish functional
assays for GPCR screening. Completion of this project will produce fundamental new knowledge about the ﬁlarial
nematode ES system and deliver new lead targets and validated screens for novel anti-ﬁlarial drug discovery."

Growing evidence indicates that the biological response to chronic stress and subsequent distress can
promote the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer via prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous
system and sustained norepinephrine release. Downstream consequences of norepinephrine exposure
include increased prostaglandin-related inflammation and an immunosuppressive landscape. Conversely,
increasing evidence supports the role of aspirin use in ovarian cancer prevention and survival. Yet, key
questions remain about the underlying biological mechanism of action of chronic stress/distress and aspirin
use (considering low and standard doses separately) and their interrelationship with ovarian cancer biology.
Specifically, we propose to evaluate the hypothesis that distress enhances ovarian cancer progression by
promoting inflammatory and immune processes and that aspirin abrogates these effects. Our innovative study
uses unique population-based and experimental resources. Aim 1 will use data from four long-term
prospective cohorts in diverse populations, a population-based case-control study, a hospital case series that
collected self-reported measures of chronic stress and distress (e.g., depression), and ovarian tumor tissue.
Aim 1 will measure gene expression in bulk high grade serous tumor samples (to capture the full tumor
microenvironment) using whole exome RNASeq. We hypothesize that distress is associated with the up-
regulation of inflammation-related and immune suppression gene expression pathways that is normalized
among aspirin users. We will also assess if the association of distress with ovarian cancer risk is attenuated
among aspirin users. Notably, we are leveraging racially and ethnically diverse studies that have highly
characterized ovarian cancer cases, allowing assessment of differences in association by race (Black,
White) and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), as well as the examination of associations between distress-
related gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes. Using an orthogonal and interactive approach, Aim 2
will use experimental ovarian cancer mouse models to characterize the progressive effect over time of daily
restraint stress on tumor inflammation and immunity as well as ovarian tumor growth, using RNASeq and
stress hormones measured via ELISA assays. We also will examine if aspirin (recapitulating equivalents of
low and standard dose aspirin in humans) counteracts the effects of chronic stress on tumor progression and
inflammatory and immune gene expression networks. This project will leverage the scientific services of
several cores, including the Puerto Rico BioBank (PRBB) and the Quantitative Science Core (QSC), with
substantial interaction with the Outreach Core, the Planning and Evaluation Core, and working with trainees in
the Research Education Core. This innovative application will inform future work to develop novel immuno-
preventive strategies, pharmacotherapies, and psychosocial interventions to prevent and treat invasive
ovarian cancer in women who experience chronic stress and distress."

The Outreach Core (OC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center (PHSU-MCC)
Partnership provides community outreach and education to improve cancer screening behaviors in underserved
populations. Currently, over 60 million persons identify as Hispanic/Latino (H/L), comprising almost 18% of the
continental United States (US) population, with an additional 3.1 million US citizens residing in Puerto Rico (PR).
Despite unique socio-cultural and biological characteristics in sub-ethnic groups, H/L populations tend to be
viewed in aggregate. Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans are the largest sub-ethnic groups among US H/Ls.
Efforts to achieve equity require an approach rooted in the knowledge and incorporation of both the
characteristics and preferences of the specific communities. Indeed, one-third of H/Ls report that they obtain at
least some health information from community-based organizations. The overall goal of the OC is to increase
community cancer awareness, community engagement, and participation in cancer health disparities research
and outreach in H/L communities. Working closely with other Partnership cores and investigators, the team
proposes to elevate and expand its activities to facilitate reciprocal communication between community members
and partnership researchers through OC educational activities, training opportunities, supporting participant
recruitment efforts, and incorporation of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP) feedback on partnership research
projects. Together with community members and Partnership researchers, the OC will increase cancer
awareness, community engagement, and participation in cancer health disparities research in the H/L
communities served by MCC (in FL) and PHSU (in PR) through the following three Specific Aims: 1) To develop,
deliver, and disseminate cancer education and outreach activities to H/L community members to reduce cancer
health disparities. The team will deliver cancer education to H/L communities in PR and FL using evidence-
based programs through multiple delivery strategies and reflecting partnership research priorities and topics of
interest identified by community members. 2) To enhance capacity for mutually beneficial research engagement
to address cancer health disparities. The team will facilitate communication between community members and
partnership investigators (e.g., CAP Research Corner), support partnership research that is responsive to
community needs (translational research), promote community participation in the partnership’s research
activities/projects to reduce cancer health disparities, and train researchers and community members in
community engagement principles. 3) To expand the capacity to train community members as lay health
promoters to deliver evidence-based cancer education programs in their communities. The team will train
community members and community partners/organizations to deliver evidence-based cancer education (e.g.,
Cancer 101, OC activities) in their local communities to address cancer health disparities."
10761769,"Project Summary/Abstract
The production of messenger RNA (mRNA) is the primary event in gene expression where genetic
information is transfered from the gene’s DNA into a disposable RNA copy. Corruption of this
process is a hallmark of many diseases including cancer. mRNA synthesis requires not only
synthesis of an RNA transcript but maturation of that transcript by 5’ capping, excision of introns
and splicing of exons and 3’ end formation by cleavage and polyA tail addition. The mRNA
processing steps that radically transform the primary transcript occur largely co-transcriptionally;
that is to say the substrate of mRNA processing is the growing nascent RNA that is extruded by
an RNA polymerase II (pol II) molecule at rates of 500-5000 bases/min. Our working model is that
synthesis and processing of a mRNA precursor are carried out in an integrated fashion within a
dynamic 'mRNA factory' complex that includes both RNA polymerase and processing factors
some of which make direct contacts with the pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). The goal of our work
is to understand how growth of the RNA chain by transcription is coordinated with its folding into
RNA secondary structures, its association with RNA binding proteins, and its maturation by
splicing and 3’ end formation. These important features of nascent RNA metabolism are all
affected by how fast the RNA chain grows. Therefore it is important to discover how the speed of
pol II is controlled as it travels along genes. When pol II completes its journey to the end of the
gene, the highly stable transcription elongation complex must be actively disassembled to recycle
the enzyme and prevent it from invading neighboring genes. We will investigate how the process
of transcription termination is achieved in carefully controlled ways at the 3’ ends of genes and
also within genes where termination can occur “prematurely”. We will use genetic and genomic
approaches in human cells to investigate these three Key Challenges:
I. What is the relation between pre-mRNA processing, nascent RNA folding, RNA
binding protein (RBP) binding, and transcription elongation?
II. How is the speed of transcription elongation regulated?
III. What mechanisms terminate pol II transcription within genes and downstream of
genes?"
10761697,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Periodontitis is initiated by a dysbiotic microbial community; however, it is the host immune response to the
microbial insults that ultimately causes the damage to the tooth supporting complex. There are considerable
limitations to the current standard of care for treatment of periodontal diseases, which is focused on eliminating
the biofilms. Increasing evidence indicates that the susceptibility to periodontitis is largely determined by the host
response. Therapies targeting the uncontrolled, overly aggressive inflammation are critical not only for blocking
the diseases but also for the reconstruction of a healthy periodontal ecosystem. Epigenetic regulation such as
histone acetylation is essential for inflammatory gene expression. A specific histone acetylation pattern is
proposed in inflammatory diseases including periodontitis. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET)
proteins are the “reader” that mediate the epigenetic marks to the transcription machinery. BET inhibitors are an
emerging class of epigenetic drugs for inflammatory diseases. Recently, we found that RVX-208, a selective
BET inhibitor that is being tested in a Phase 3 clinical trial for cardiovascular diseases, significantly suppresses
inflammatory cytokine production and inhibits osteoclast differentiation. These findings suggested that histone
acetylation and BET proteins may have important roles in periodontal inflammation, and may be potential
diagnostic markers and pharmaceutical targets for periodontitis. To better understand epigenetic regulation in
periodontitis and develop a novel therapeutic for periodontitis, we propose to 1) Identify the histone acetylation
and BET protein expression profile in periodontitis patients; 2) Define the role of BET proteins in periodontal
inflammation; 3) Determine if targeting histone acetylation by a selective BET inhibitor can ameliorate periodontal
inflammation and alveolar bone loss in vivo. The proposed studies will generate critical clinical data to support
the importance of epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and help us develop the first
“epi” drug to treat the diseases.

10761763,"Integrin αIIbβ3 activation in platelets is an important step on the road to fibrinogen binding, platelet aggregation,
and primary hemostasis. Overreaction of platelet accumulation, however, can lead to life-threatening arterial
thrombosis, a hallmark of end-stage cardiovascular disease. Carefully controlled regulation of the activation
state of αIIbβ3, therefore, is crucial for the ability of platelets to fulfill their hemostatic function while at the same
time limiting thrombotic risk. The activation of αIIbβ3, like other members of the integrin family of cell adhesion
and signaling receptors, is carefully regulated by the association of cytosolic proteins that bind in a cellular
activation-dependent manner to the integrin β3 subunit cytoplasmic domain. Kindlin-3 is a FERM domain-
containing protein that is primarily expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin. Previous studies have shown that
members of the kindlin family promote integrin activation primarily by binding to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail
and mediating integrin clustering via a process known as avidity modulation. Kindlin-3 has been shown to be
essential for integrin activation, as exemplified by the finding that patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency III,
a congenital inherited disorder characterized by leukocyte and platelet dysfunction and severe bleeding, have
causative loss-of-function mutations in the kindlin-3 gene. Precisely how kindlin-3 acts mechanistically to
support integrin αIIbβ3 activation, however, remains largely unknown. Consistent with the integrin clustering
hypothesis, a related kindlin, kindlin-2, has been shown to form a FERM domain-swapped dimer, and we have
obtained preliminary data showing that dimerization is also required for kindlin-3 to promote avidity modulation
of integrin αIIbβ3. Interestingly, however, dimeric forms of highly purified kindlin-3 have not been observed in
either crystals or in solution, suggesting that extra components may be required to facilitate kindlin-3
dimerization and integrin clustering. In this regard, we have recently found that kindlin-3 directly interacts with
the myosin essential light chain (ELC), a key component of myosin that exists as a dimer by attaching to the
proximal neck regions of myosin. Importantly, preliminary data obtained in our lab has shown that the myosin
ELC also contributes to avidity modulation of integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets. Based on these findings, the purpose
of this application is to examine the hypothesis that the ability of kindlin-3 to dimerize and modulate αIIbβ3
activation involves a heretofore undescribed interaction with the myosin ECL. In Specific Aim 1, we will
determine the molecular basis of kindlin-3 in interacting with the myosin ECL by employing multiple
biochemical and structural approaches. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the role of kindlin-3/ECL
interactions in regulating the affinity and avidity modulations of integrin αIIbβ3 in both mouse and human
platelets. Together, we believe that the finding from this study will establish the detailed molecular mechanism
by which kindlin-3 fine-tunes integrin αIIbβ3 activation in platelets, which may lead to novel opportunities for
developing safer and more specific anti-thrombotic strategies."
10762460,"The bacterial cell envelope is a remarkable and complex structure that guards bacteria from their surrounding environment. A defining feature of Gram-negative bacteria is the presence of an outer membrane (OM) that encapsulates the peptidoglycan layer of these organisms. While the inner membrane (IM) is composed of glycerophospholipids (GPLs), the OM is a bilayer with extreme lipid asymmetry with GPL confined to the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) localized to the outer leaflet. This unique membrane organization affords Gram-negative bacteria protection from large polar molecules, as well as lipophilic compounds, serving as an essential innate barrier to a variety of antibiotics and toxic compounds.  Remarkably, the high-priority Gram-negative pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii can completely inactivate LPS biosynthesis as an alternative mechanism of resistance to the “last-resort” antibiotics called polymyxins. The primary objective of this application is to investigate the mechanisms required for maintenance of the cell envelope of A. baumannii, regardless of LPS status. While the benefit of an asymmetric OM relative to a GPL bilayer is apparent due to the impermeable barrier it provides, the lack of LPS essentiality in A. baumannii can be used a tool to explore novel mechanisms of OM stability in both the presence or absence of LPS. In Aim 1, we will investigate changes to the bacterium during its transition from an LPS-deficient to a LPS-positive cell, including how GPL transport influences LPS structure. For Aim 2 our focus will be the identification of genes that support LPS-deficiency, including the role of lipoproteins and how they are transported to the cell surface regardless of LPS status. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize novel gene products necessary for OM stability in LPS-positive A. baumannii uncovered by a genetic and chemical synthetic lethality screen. Given the current literature, the application is built on a strong scientific premise addressing major gaps in our understanding of the A. baumannii cell envelope and other Gram-negative pathogens. Furthermore, the Aims focus on highly conserved pathways that impact membrane biogenesis, bacterial pathogenesis, and antimicrobial development."

effectiveness have not been adequately studied in this high-risk patient population. Vaccination may not yield
protective or sustained immune responses in individuals with glomerular disease as a result of exposure to
immunosuppressive medications, altered immune cell function, and urinary loss of immunoglobulin and
complement factors. As a result, there remain pressing questions regarding whether these antibodies confer in-
vivo protection from influenza and pneumococcal infection. Evidence gaps that need to be addressed in
preparation for pragmatic trials focused on infection-prevention measures in this population include frequency of
administration of recommended vaccines, pervasiveness of infectious complications, and rates of influenza and
pneumococcal vaccine seroconversion and seroprotection. Prior studies have been limited by small sample size,
insufficiently characterized cohorts, and the use of assays that measure non-opsonic, and thus potentially non-
functional, antibodies.
The objective of this proposal is to describe the association of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination with
influenza and pneumococcal infections and describe functional vaccine immunogenicity in patients with
glomerular disease. Three projects have been proposed to achieve this objective: an analysis of influenza and
pneumococcal vaccine use and effectiveness in a nationwide healthcare claims database (MarketScan®), a
study examining vaccine immunogenicity in the multicenter NIDDK-sponsored Cure Glomerulonephropathy
(CureGN) study, and creation of a multicenter cohort to examine 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine
immunogenicity in children with nephrotic syndrome. The primary hypothesis is that, independent of kidney
function, rates of influenza and pneumococcal infection and suboptimal vaccine response will be higher in
individuals with active glomerular disease, greater immunosuppression exposure, greater proteinuria, and
younger age. Dr. Glenn’s career development goals include gaining advanced training in statistical methods and
epidemiologic study design, with a focus on the analysis of longitudinal datasets, healthcare claims data, and
multicenter vaccine immunogenicity studies. Dr. Glenn will receive mentorship from Dr. Amy Mottl and Dr. Ronald
Falk, both experts in the field of glomerular kidney disease. Additionally, Dr. Glenn will have a scientific advisory
committee comprised of experts in vaccine immunogenicity, infectious disease, healthcare claims data analysis,
and epidemiology. This work will inform the development of an R01 application in which Dr. Glenn leads a
pragmatic trial investigating pneumococcal vaccination strategies among children with nephrotic syndrome."
10763367,"Summary. Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames/narrows the airways. Chronic allergic inflammation
is primarily mediated by the aberrant activation/expansion of T-helper 2 (Th2) cells to airborne allergens.
Interestingly, most people with Th2 asthma experience their first symptoms at a young age, suggesting that
outcomes in adult asthma are determined in early childhood. In recent decades, incidence, morbidity, and
mortality of pediatric allergic asthma and associated cost have been increasing worldwide, specifically among
industrialized countries; and not due to the genetic background, but mainly because of the effect of
environmental and lifestyle risk factors. The ""hygiene hypothesis"" proposes that the decreased exposure to
dust containing high levels of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) and other microorganism-derived compounds at a very
early age is one of the main drivers of the increasing incidence of asthma. However, no precise mechanism for
this unique requirement for a high-LPS environment during infancy had been delineated. We have published
that exposure to allergen induced allergen-specific Th2 cell responses; but exposure to allergen containing
relatively low-doses of LPS prevented the initial priming of Th2 cells and development of subsequent Th2 cell-
mediated inflammatory response in the airways of adult but not infant mice. These data show that adult and
infant mice respond to LPS with different thresholds and, thus, relatively higher-doses of LPS are required to
prevent Th2 cell responses and allergic inflammation in infant mice. Mechanistically, we found that unlike adult
counterparts, infant conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) had impaired ability to suppress allergic-Th2 responses
upon low-dose endotoxin sensitization. Importantly, our new data suggest that for the effective suppression of
allergic Th2 cell activity, both the functional activation of cDCs, and the responsiveness of activated T cells are
contingent on the coordinated actions of several cytokines (i.e., TNFα, IL-12, IL-18, IFNγ, and IL-6). Further,
our data suggest that the first cells that sense LPS and produce cytokines to license the function of the cDCs
are monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Finally, our data show that the mother's milk-based diet
conditions the differentiation and function of moDCs, which ultimately leads to a shift toward Th2 cell bias
during infancy. Thus, we hypothesize that in response to low-dose LPS/allergen sensitization, moDCs initiate a
cascade of cytokines, which ultimately mediate the suppression of Th2-driven allergic inflammation in adults. In
infants, otherwise, this path is suppressed by the influence of the natural diet; rendering them more susceptible
to allergy disease. In this proposal, we will test how specific cytokines modulate T helper cell program to
allergens and how the infant diet and microbial exposure differentially affects this process. We believe the
experiments in this proposal will significantly contribute to our understanding of how diet-environment
interactions contribute to the development of allergic sensitization in children and ultimately will reveal new
information about potential targets for prevention of asthma/allergies in children."
10768560,"Summary/Abstract
 While the human genome provides a parts list of >20,000 proteins, it is still largely unknown how these
proteins assemble into ‘molecular machines’ to carry out their biological roles. This is important both for basic
characterization of human genes and for understanding the mechanisms underlying most human genetic
diseases, which often arise from defects in systems of proteins working together. We focus on the >9,000 human
proteins shared across eukaryotes and dating to the last eukaryotic common ancestor. These ancient proteins
carry out critical cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, splicing, mitochondrial and
ciliary processes, and trafficking, among others. They are disproportionately drivers of human disease, linked to
a wide array of disorders, spanning cancers, birth defects, metabolic disorders, Parkinson disease, Huntington
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and more. Nearly 1,300 of these deeply conserved human proteins are
still mostly uncharacterized, despite almost certainly having important cell roles. A fundamental question is how
all of these proteins work together to support cell function. However, a key limitation remains the lack of large-
scale data directly interrogating these proteins’ expression, interactions, and activation states. Current
approaches to quantify the proteome are only beginning to survey the proteins in mammalian cells to any
significant depth, and consistently suffer from low sensitivity and throughput. These limitations have slowed
medical applications, e.g. biomarker discovery, where techniques including mass spectrometry and antibody
arrays often lack sufficient sensitivity and quantification accuracy to be effective. We propose research in three
broad areas: First, we propose a major effort to biochemically define the main human protein complexes,
providing a mechanistic basis for interpreting diverse human genetics and diseases. We will focus on
evolutionarily conserved human proteins due to these proteins’ critical importance to cellular function, leveraging
studies in other species using a comparative proteomics approach. Second, we are developing surrogate
functional assays for deeply conserved human proteins by systematically humanizing yeast cells, replacing each
essential yeast gene in turn by its human version. The resulting strains serve as new physical reagents for
studying human genes in a simplified organismal context, opening up simple high-throughput assays of human
gene function, the impact of human genetic variation on gene function, the screening and repurposing of drugs,
and the rapid determination of mechanisms of drug resistance. Finally, we aim to advance new proteomics
technologies, single-molecule protein sequencing and shotgun electron microscopy, both of which enable new
types of highly sensitive characterization of protein expression and physical organization relevant to many
aspects of human cell biology and disease. Success of these aims will give new insights into basic human cell
biology and biochemistry, laying the foundation for future attempts to intervene, chemically or genetically, with
those macromolecules most critical to the functioning of cells."
10768561,"Project Summary:
 Allergic reactions are elicited by the allergen-mediated-clustering of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies
on the surface of mast cells, which is “the key event” in initiation of the systemic reaction. Allergic diseases are
increasing health concerns in developed nations. Depending on the severity of the allergic reaction, the results
can vary from a simple itch to anaphylactic shock, which results in 1,500 deaths each year in the US. There
are no cures for allergies, and current therapies focus on treatment of acute symptoms or chronic immune
suppression. Even with the most restricted diets, accidental exposure is very frequent for food allergies, putting
patients at risk for life threatening anaphylaxis. Thus, there is a need for more effective, alternative treatments
for IgE-mediated allergic responses. The objective of this application is to develop allergen-specific IgE
inhibitors (cHBI: covalent heterobivalent inhibitor) that target allergen-binding IgE, and prevent it from
recognizing the allergen. This approach inhibits the allergic reaction before it starts with specific targeting but
without broad immune suppression. Naturally occurring allergens are typically complex, structurally
heterogenous proteins with multiple allergy-inducing epitopes. Historically it has been a challenge to identify
contributions from individual allergen epitopes to the overall allergic reaction. During the previous funding
cycle, we addressed this problem by developing a multicomponent epitope presentation platform that we
named nanoallergens. Using nanoallergen screening, we can study the immunogenicity of individual allergen
epitopes, and identify immunodominant epitopes. Using the identified immunodominant epitope, we synthesize
cHBI inhibitors that mimic the epitope and block the IgE antibodies that recognize the specific epitope. This
method inhibits the IgE from recognizing the allergen when it enters the system and prevents the initiation of
the allergic reaction. We have recently demonstrated that using a cocktail of cHBIs, we can block peanut
allergic reactions using patient samples in an in vitro cellular degranulation method. In the current application,
we will evaluate the peanut allergy inhibition in vivo using a humanized mice model. Simultaneously, we will
exploit the potential of the cHBI as a platform to block other allergens including shellfish, dust mite and
hazelnut. The proposed work is innovative and significant because it (i) offers a novel molecular design
approach to inhibit “the key event” triggering an allergic response with potential long-term clinical applications
in food, environmental and drug allergies, (ii) it does so without any non-specific suppression of immune
system components, and (iii) develops a much needed, physiologically relevant, easily adjustable and
reproducible platform (nanoallergens), which will be used in identifying immunodominant public allergen
epitopes and their relative significance during degranulation responses. Lastly, this application has high
potential impact because cHBI has the potential for translation to the clinic."
10768644,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent studies have revealed pervasive transcriptional regulation through alternative promoters in normal
tissues and cancer. How the majority of alternative promoters contribute to tumor formation, diagnosis or
treatment remains unknown. Tet1 was first identified as an MLL partner in AML. It belongs to the Tet (ten-
eleven translocation) family of proteins (Tet1/2 and Tet3), which oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and other oxi-mC intermediates, thereby facilitating DNA demethylation.
Interestingly, we found that a short isoform of TET1 (referred to as TET1-S), which contains a catalytic domain
but lacks the N-terminal CXXC domain, and is under control of an alternative promoter, was expressed in
human bone marrow (BM) cells. Additionally, TET1-S was upregulated in BM cells from Myelodysplastic
Syndrome (MDS) patients as compared to healthy individuals. We showed that TET1-S is expressed in BM
cells at a much higher level compared with TET1-F. However, its role in the hematopoietic system is unknown.
Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that Tet1-S plays an important role in the maintenance of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and its upregulation contributes to the development of MDS by disrupting
normal function of HSCs and hematopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, we will determine 1) the oncogenic role
and underlying mechanisms of Tet1-S in the pathogenesis of MDS, 2) whether Tet1-S is required for the
development of MDS, and 3) the molecular mechanisms by which Tet1-S regulates gene expression in HSPCs
and erythroid progenitor cells. We will employ multiple genomic approaches to systematically analyze the
progressive effects of Tet1-S overexpression on 5mhC/mC distribution, chromatin accessibility and gene
expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
Our work will provide new insights into the distinct role of TET1-S upregulation in the pathogenesis of MDS as
well as its specific role and mechanisms in maintaining epigenetic landscapes and gene regulation in HSPCs."
10768649,"SIGNIFICANCE TO VETERANS HEALTH: Two-thirds of all veterans are 55 years of age or older. Sarcopenia
is a syndrome that effects approximately 25% of the U.S. population over the age of 70 characterized by
progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as
physical disability, poor quality of life and even death. Further, the development of sarcopenia may lead to
secondary health conditions such as disuse, malnutrition, falls, fractures and diabetes. In addition to the physical
ailments that accompany patients that suffer from sarcopenia, sarcopenia contributes to over $18.5 billion dollars
of total health care expenditures. The prevalence of sarcopenia is higher in subjects presenting another health
condition than in healthy subjects including mental conditions such as depression that are common among
veterans. There are currently no effective treatments for sarcopenia because underlying mechanisms are not
fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to test if denervation induced generation of lipid
hydroperoxides (LOOHs), through the enzyme 12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-Lox) or through direct oxidation of
lipids, leads to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction that initiates muscle
atrophy, muscle protein breakdown, and weakness. RESEARCH PLAN: In Specific Aim 1, I will test the effect
of reducing LOOHs via treatment with the LOOH scavenger liproxstatin-1 on mitochondrial function, NMJ
structure and function, protein turnover, and maintenance of muscle mass and function in aged mice. In Specific
Aim 2, I will test the effect of muscle specific genetic deletion of 12/15-Lox, an enzyme that generates eicosanoids
and oxylipins, on the maintenance of muscle mass and function in aged mice. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, I will
test the effect of muscle specific overexpression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), an enzyme that reduces
LOOHs within membranes, on the maintenance of muscle mass and function in aged mice. We will use a
combination of pharmacological approaches, genetic mouse models, and novel research techniques to test the
central hypothesis. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: All of my Specific Aims focus on reducing skeletal muscle
LOOHs (either enzymatically generated or direct oxidation of lipids) in response to age-related denervation. I
hypothesize that my interventions will ameliorate skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction in hindlimb muscle
from aged mice by reducing lipid peroxidation, improving mitochondrial function, reducing rates of protein
degradation, and maintaining NMJ integrity. My preliminary data clearly shows that LOOH generation is elevated
in aged muscle, and that LOOH generation is strongly correlated to muscle mass loss in models of denervation
atrophy. For skeletal muscle mass loss to occur, rates of protein degradation have to be greater than rates of
protein synthesis. Therefore, my interventions have to reduce rates of protein degradation and/or increase rates
of protein synthesis in denervated muscle. There are multiple lines of evidence that shows mitochondrial health
is important for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function. My preliminary data shows that
overexpression of GPx4 in a model of accelerated sarcopenia improves mitochondrial function, which may
reduce muscle mass loss. Therefore, we hypothesize that reducing LOOHs in muscle will improve mitochondrial
function in aged mice. Finally, denervation can propagate oxidative stress and NMJ disruption in surrounding
fibers. We predict that reducing LOOHs in muscle will slow NMJ degradation of the surrounding fibers.
TRAINING PLAN: My short-term goals are to delineate the mechanisms of LOOH driven sarcopenia and receive
training in oxidative stress, aging, the use of stable isotopes, using genetic animal models, and scientific
communication. I will receive this training through a combination of meetings with my mentoring team,
conferences, presentation, formal courses, and performing experiments. The training plan I have outlined will
allow me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent VA scientist."
10768651,"Project Summary / Abstract
Cardiovascular disease and heart failure are highly prevalent among the veteran population. Cardiac
transplantation remains a preferred therapy for patients who suffer from end-stage heart failure.
However, outcomes after heart transplantation are adversely impacted by primary graft dysfunction, a
consequence of ischemia reperfusion injury. Primary graft dysfunction causes immediate tissue
damage and can also augment adaptive immune responses that trigger graft rejection. Currently, there
are no effective therapies for primary graft dysfunction after heart transplantation and the management
of these patients is mostly supportive. Our laboratory has developed intravital imaging platforms that
has allowed us to visualize the infiltration of leukocytes into murine heart grafts in real time. Through
these approaches we have uncovered cellular and molecular cues that regulate the trafficking of
neutrophils and monocytes, innate immune cells that are known to mediate tissue damage, into
transplanted hearts. Our findings raise the intriguing prospect that targeting immune pathways and cell
populations within the donor graft can control the initial immune response following heart
transplantation. During the previous funding period we have discovered that ferroptosis, a non-
apoptotic form of cell death mediates the early inflammatory response after reperfusion of heart grafts.
We have reported that graft endothelial cells and tissue-resident CCR2+ macrophages play critical and
complementary roles in driving the recruitment of neutrophils to the transplanted heart. Now we have
generated preliminary data showing that additional donor immune cell populations and signaling
pathways regulate leukocyte recruitment to cardiac grafts. In this proposal, we will use state-of-the-art
techniques including intravital two-photon microscopy, new positron emission tomography probes,
single cell RNA sequencing and novel murine strains to perform studies that will define the role of donor
non-classical monocytes (Aim 1) and TREM-1/3 signaling (Aim 2) in promoting inflammatory
responses after reperfusion of ischemic heart grafts. Our studies will lay the foundation for novel
therapies that will improve outcomes for heart transplant recipients and patients who suffer from
myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury due to other conditions."
10768830,"PROJECT 2-PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The coagulation system is tightly regulated to ensures hemostasis is properly achieved following injury. Factor
V (FV) is a crucial component of this system playing both procoagulant and anticoagulant roles. Imbalanced
expression and control of these activities can result in bleeding or thrombosis. Recent work by us and others
suggests that the central B-domain of FV plays a key role in regulating its opposing functions. Activation of FV
to FVa leads to the release of the B-domain, committing it fully to a procoagulant path resulting in rapid
thrombin generation. However, FV also has anticoagulant properties, working with APC and TFPIα as a
cofactor to inhibit coagulation. Our central hypothesis is that there are unique features of the FV B-domain that
regulate the development of FV's procoagulant activity and contribute to function with APC and TFPIα. We
propose that the B-domain acts as a gatekeeper for FV, controlling the balance between procoagulant and
anticoagulant activity. There is limited information about the B-domain structure and little known about the
mechanisms and structural elements that underlie these functions. This proposal aims to address these
knowledge gaps and use the new information to improve clinical understanding and investigate potential
therapies for bleeding or thrombosis. In Aim 1, we plan to determine the structure of the FV B-domain using
atomic force microscopy. We will investigate how proteolysis affects its structure and examine how specific
structural features regulate procoagulant function and interaction with TFPIα. We will test the hypothesis that
the B-domain adopts a double lariat structure which is stabilized by certain sequences and disrupted by
discrete proteolysis. The structural changes that occur in the B-domain as a result will be studied to understand
interactions with FXa and TFPIα. In Aim 2, we propose to elucidate mechanisms and structural features of the
anticoagulant functions of FV and its spliced variant FV-short, and to expand knowledge on their physiological
effects. Using preliminary data, we will test the hypothesis that FV-short has a stronger anticoagulant effect
when acting as a cofactor for APC compared to FV and investigate specific structural features that may
enhance or inhibit this function. To achieve this, a series of FV and FV-short variants will be evaluated, and we
will investigate procoagulant antibodies that bind to FV/FV-short and affect the APC and TFPIα anticoagulant
pathways in plasma and in vivo. In Aim 3, we plan to advance work on new antibodies that target FV, FV-short
or FVa to modulate its pro- or anticoagulant function. The goal is to use these antibodies to improve our
understanding of these pathways and develop new therapeutic approaches. Our preliminary data support the
hypothesis that FV-specific antibodies targeting its anticoagulant function may have potent procoagulant
effects in vivo. By investigating the structure of the B-domain, studying how it changes due to proteolysis and
understanding its interactions with other proteins, we aim to identify new ways to manipulate the procoagulant
and anticoagulant functions of FV for therapeutic purposes."
10768831,"Project 3-Abstract
The overall objectives of this project are A.) to generate and employ RNA aptamers as probes to develop a more
thorough understanding of the specific macromolecular interactions that control blood coagulation and B.) to
utilize this new knowledge to generate potent, yet rapidly reversible, agents to regulate this process for research
and clinical applications. Using high resolution X-ray crystal structure data to guide us, we will rationally generate
and evaluate bifunctional EXosite-ACTive site (EXACT) inhibitors based upon aptamers and small molecule
active site inhibitors. We hypothesize that such bifunctional agents will be particularly potent inhibitors of
coagulation factor activity as blood feeding animals have employed this approach to create/evolve extremely
potent inhibitors, such as hirudin and tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP), in nature. For such bioinspired, X-ray
structure guided studies, we will covalently link an aptamer that specifically binds a specific clotting factor to an
active site proteinase inhibitor to achieve potent and specific inhibition of proteinase function. Moreover, we
hypothesize that an antidote oligonucleotide can made against the aptamer portion of the conjugate to rapidly
and fully reverse such potent EXACT inhibitors.
Our three specific aims are:
Aim 1: Conduct proof-of-concept studies with thrombin to optimize an approach for potent and bivalent
specific inhibition wherein specificity for the proteinase is provided by an aptamer and inhibition of
active site function of thrombin arises from a small molecule ligand coupled through a linker to the
aptamer. We have termed such bifunctional agents “EXACT” inhibitors as they target both an EXosite
and the ACTive site on the same proteinase.
Aim 2: Evaluate the generalizability of the studies on thrombin by producing and characterizing bivalent
EXACT inhibitors for factor Xa (FXa), factor XIa (FXIa), activated protein C (APC) as well as a
prothrombinase-specific inhibitor which does not inhibit free factor Xa.
Aim 3: Characterize EXACT anticoagulant function in ex-vivo models of ECMO (extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation) and in vivo models of ECMO and CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass) that lead to
fulminant activation of coagulation."
10768832,"Project 4—Abstract
The intrinsic Xase enzyme complex, composed of the substrate factor (F) X, cofactor FVIIIa, and protease
FIXa, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of sustained coagulation. Deficiencies or dysfunction in these clotting
factors leads to the bleeding disorders FX-deficiency, hemophilia A (HA), and hemophilia B (HB), respectively.
The molecular details of the structure and function of FVIIIa, FIXa, and FX within the intrinsic Xase are
incompletely understood. Current treatments for these diseases have limited worldwide availability and are
highly burdensome. Our objectives in this proposal are to develop new therapeutic approaches for these
bleeding disorders and clarify the mechanisms that govern the assembly and function of the intrinsic Xase. To
this end, we have preliminary data indicating that FVIII-mimetics (a class of drugs approved for HA treatment)
can be repurposed for select HB genotypes. We have identified >40 HB-causing loss-of-function FIX variants
whose procoagulant activity is enhanced by FVIII-mimetics. We hypothesize that their loss-of-function is due
to disrupted interactions with FVIIIa or FX; these variants also provide a new experimental system where the
role of intrinsic Xase assembly of specific regions of FIXa can be biochemically and structurally interrogated.
We further hypothesize that there are disease-causing loss-of-function FX variants with disrupted FVIIIa
interactions whose activation could be rescued by the alternative FVIIImimetic/FIXa Xase complex.
Conversely, we have also identified a class of gain-of-function FVIII variants with high specific activity, which
we hypothesize is due to enhanced FVIIIa/FIXa interactions. Our experimental approach aims to 1) determine
the translation potential of FVIII-mimetics for select HB and FX-deficiency genotypes as well as the potential
for high-specific activity FVIII variants to address current limitations of HA gene therapy and 2) to clarify the
molecular assembly and function of the intrinsic Xase complex utilizing these clinically-relevant loss-of-function
and gain-of-function variants. In aim 1, using biochemical and structural approaches, we will determine the
mechanism of loss-of-function of FVIII-mimetic rescuable HB-causing FIX variants with amino acid
substitutions throughout the protein. In aim 2, we will develop a FVIII-mimetic adopted HB and FX-deficient
mouse model and determine the in vivo hemostatic potency of FVIII-mimetics for these disorders. In aim 3,
using biochemical and structural approaches, we will determine the mechanism of the high-specific activity of
our new gain-of-function FVIII variants. Further, we will determine their hemostatic potency over a range of
injury models in HA mice as well as their ability to enhanced gene therapy for HA. Together, these studies will
provide mechanistic insights into the regulation and activity of the intrinsic Xase as well as developing
alternative therapeutic approaches for these bleeding disorders."

10768567,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
KCNQ channels are key determinants of neuronal activity, and recent clinical evidence identifies mutations in
KCNQ2 as a cause of neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. Most variants associated with neonatal epileptic
encephalopathy are Loss-of-Function.However, recent work also identified a recurrent KCNQ2 Gain-of-Function
mutation (R201C) in patients with neonatal onset encephalopathy. Patients with both KCNQ2 Loss- and Gain-
of-Function mutations exhibit respiratory dysfunction including central hypoventilation syndrome, a condition
thought to result from loss of respiratory chemoreception, i.e., the mechanism by which the brain regulates
breathing in response to CO2/H+. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is an important chemoreceptor region, and
we have shown previously that KCNQ channels regulate basal activity and neurotransmitter modulation of RTN
chemoreceptors. Therefore, I hypothesize that KCNQ2 channels are the principal KCNQ subunits that control
activity of RTN chemoreceptors. Ipropose that KNCQ2 Gain-of-Functionwill hyperpolarize RTNchemoreceptors
and eliminate their contribution to the drive to breathe, whereas KCNQ2 Loss-of-Function mutations will
destabilize RTN chemoreceptor activity and disrupt modulation by neurotransmitters, thus also contributing to
unstable breathing. Additionally, I will also test whether KCNQ2 dysfunction affects not only the RTN but the
respiratory control circuit in general including other chemoreceptors, inspiratory rhythmogenic pre-Bötzinger
complex neurons, and output respiratory motor neurons. Objectives of this study are to investigate, from the
cellular to system level, contributions of KCNQ2 channels to chemoreceptorfunction and respiratory control. The
two Specific Aims of this project are: 1) determine cellular effects of KCNQ2 on respiratory chemoreception,
inspiratory rhythmgeneration and motor output and 2) determine the essential role of KCNQ2 channels in control
of breathing. The rationale for the proposed research is that by understandingwhether and howKCNQ2 channels
regulate neuronal activity across multiple levels of the respiratory circuit, and respiratory behavior, I will lay a
foundation for development of treatments for respiratory problems like apnea and central hypoventilation
syndrome."
10768569,"Membrane traffic in the endomembrane system is well characterized at the level of components, but crucial aspects of
the engineering logic of this system remain obscure. Definitions of endomembrane system compartments are often fuzzy,
and knowledge of the directionalities and functions of membrane traffic pathways is incomplete. A particularly enigmatic
organelle is the Golgi apparatus. Studies of yeast cells indicate that Golgi cisternae are transient, maturing structures, with
resident Golgi proteins distributing in a polarized manner across cisternae of different ages. The Golgi recycles components
internally and also communicates extensively with other endomembrane system organelles, but the links between
membrane traffic and Golgi organization are poorly understood. We propose that the Golgi can be productively viewed
as a set of maturing cisternae, with various membrane traffic pathways being switched on and off in an orderly way
during cisternal maturation. Our goal is to elucidate these Golgi-associated membrane traffic pathways and to dissect
the molecular logic circuit that controls them.
 We use budding yeasts as an experimental system. The secretory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an
unusual organization: non-stacked Golgi cisternae are scattered throughout the cytoplasm, and based on our recent work,
the trans-Golgi network (TGN) serves as an early endosome. These properties simplify the analysis of individual maturing
cisternae by 4D fluorescence microscopy. By determining the kinetic signatures of proteins as they arrive and depart
during cisternal maturation in wild-type or mutant cells, we can obtain novel insights. Recent discoveries include: (1) COPI
vesicles mediate recycling of early but not late Golgi proteins. (2) The AP-1 clathrin adaptor is restricted in yeast to the
TGN. This result, taken together with prior work from other groups, implies that AP-1 mediates intra-Golgi recycling
downstream of COPI. (3) As revealed by our development of a regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo that can be
visualized in maturing cisternae, AP-1 has an unexpected ability to promote intra-Golgi recycling of this secretory cargo.
(4) In unpublished work, AP-1 cooperates with the clathrin adaptor Ent5 to drive two sequential pathways of intra-Golgi
recycling. Transmembrane proteins that recycle by the various COPI- or AP-1-dependent pathways become concentrated
in different cisternae, thereby creating the polarized distribution of proteins across the Golgi.
 Our ongoing efforts with S. cerevisiae are aimed at a molecular characterization of these membrane traffic
pathways. We plan to assign roles in specific pathways to individual vesicle tethers, SNAREs, and lipid metabolism
processes. In addition, we will identify functional connections that coordinate the timing of the different pathways.
 A newer project employs cultured mammalian cells. We will use imaging and genome editing to revisit three
phenomena that are seemingly at odds with the cisternal maturation concept: nonlinear cargo exit from the Golgi,
exchange of secretory cargoes between Golgi ribbons, and retention of aberrant proteins in the TGN. Those phenomena
can potentially all be explained by a conserved pathway involving AP-1-dependent recycling of secretory cargoes. Our
ambition is to achieve a unified understanding of how the secretory pathway operates in both yeast and mammalian cells."
10768652,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in elderly veterans. It is well established that
post-stroke immune responses have a substantial impact on the progression of ischemic brain injury and brain
recovery, but there are no clinical treatments that successfully harness the restorative power of the immune
system while also tempering inflammation-induced secondary injuries. The reasons for this gap are multifactorial,
but include a preclinical overemphasis on young adult animals, which simply do not display the same
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying brain ischemia as the aged, including the dynamic inflammatory
dialogue between glia and neurons. We propose to fill the critical gap in elderly veteran care by focusing on aged
animals and repurposing an FDA-approved drug at low doses to correct hyperactive immune responses and tip
the balance in favor of sustained tissue healing and long-term recovery of neurological functions.
 To commence this goal, we have conducted pilot studies on proteins that are highly enriched in microglia
and brain-infiltrating macrophages (Mi/MΦ)—including the retinoid X receptor (RXR). RXR binds to peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) to govern the transcription of genes critically involved in redox status,
inflammation resolution, trophic factor production, and metabolism. Thus, RXR/PPARγ activation lies at the apex
of a decision tree for arbitrating between polymorphic, often-opposing immune responses in Mi and MΦ. To
engage this important biological target, we have chosen a selective RXR agonist, bexarotene, an FDA-approved
antineoplastic agent lacking in pan-immunosuppressive effects and with excellent safety profiles. The scientific
premise underlying the engagement of the RXR/PPARγ axis as a superior biological target for stroke is its ability
to titrate immune balance toward anti-inflammatory/pro-repair phenotypes, while avoiding indiscriminate
suppression of immune function in the vulnerable elderly.
 The premise of this proposal is also strengthened by our new preliminary discoveries: 1) Mi/MΦ-specific
conditional knockout (mKO) of RXR or PPARγ worsens long-term outcomes after permanent distal middle
cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in mice. 2) RXR or PPARγ mKO mice exhibit impairments in post-stroke
efferocytosis (Mi/MΦ phagocytosis of dying neurons) and resolution of neuroinflammation. 3) PPARγ mKO alters
the Mi/MΦ transcriptome, with heightened proinflammatory responses and impaired phagocytosis according to
RNA sequencing data. 4) Excitingly, intraperitoneal administration of low-dose bexarotene (10-20 times lower
than in clinical trials) improves long-term outcomes after dMCAO in aged mice (20 months old). Accordingly, our
research group is now in an excellent position to test the following core hypothesis: Activation of RXR improves
long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke by promoting efferocytosis and inflammation-resolving, pro-
repair microglial/macrophage responses. If funded, we will tackle three aims in a timely and efficient manner:
 Aim 1: Systematically test if bexarotene improves long-term histological and functional outcomes in aged
(20 months old) stroke mice of both sexes.
 Aim 2: Test the subhypothesis that bexarotene promotes efferocytosis in Mi/MΦ and attenuates acute
ischemic brain injury via activation of RXR.
 Aim 3: Test the subhypothesis that enhanced inflammation-resolving, pro-repair actions of Mi/MΦ contribute
to bexarotene-afforded, RXR-dependent long-term beneficial effects against stroke.
 We will use aged subjects of both sexes and deploy state-of-the-art tools, such as cell-specific, conditional
RXR knockout, electrophysiological measurements, stereological counting, and a battery of established behavior
tests to gain novel mechanistic insights into the role of Mi/MΦ in stroke evolution. A rigorously confirmed
beneficial effect of bexarotene on aged mice would facilitate its clinical translation into a potential stroke therapy
for military men and women as well as elderly civilians."

The exploration and interpretation of large, complex datasets is vital to discovery in genomics. However,
researchers now confront a fundamental limitation; unprecedented experiments are possible thanks to modern
DNA sequencing technologies, yet existing “genome arithmetic” algorithms and data formats for comparing
and dissecting the resulting datasets are incapable of keeping pace with inexorable growth in dataset size and
complexity. Genome arithmetic (GA) represents a powerful and widely used set of techniques that allow one to
explore relationships among sets of genome features (e.g., a gene, sequence alignment, ChIP-seq peak, or
anything that can be described with chromosome coordinates). GA is used for a broad spectrum of analyses
including: the detection of intersecting/overlapping features (e.g., sequence alignments and exons), describing
feature coverage among datasets, and the merging, subtraction, and complementation of feature datasets. GA
functionality is used by all genome browsers and data visualization tools, and by analysis software such as
GATK and SAMTOOLS. Our BEDTOOLS software has become a staple of genomics research and is used in
a broad range of genomic analyses. However, continuous support and development have also revealed key
limitations with its current functionality and crucial limitations that hinder analytical flexibility. We argue that
innovations in genome arithmetic algorithms, data formats and user-friendly software are needed to: (1)
empower researchers to conduct large-scale analyses with simple, flexible tools; (2) improve analysis tools to
keep pace with the scale of modern datasets; (3) visualize and quantify relationships among genome
datasets.
 Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to provide the genomics community with innovative
new algorithms and software that keep pace with modern genomics experiments and facilitate future
discoveries. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Develop a refined suite of genome arithmetic algorithms and
programming interface for scalable analysis with BEDTOOLS. (2) Create new algorithms and genome
interval sketching approaches to enable large-scale dataset comparisons. (3) Enable large-scale
visualization and statistical analyses grounded in our recent advances in devising scalable new data
formats. These innovations will yield with scalable new algorithms, data structures and formats that will
empower thousands of genomics researchers around the world."

 Aggression is a key aspect of animal social life, playing critical roles in territorial defense, resource
acquisition, and protection of offspring. Like other behaviors, aggression is reinforced through experience.
This reinforcement often serves beneficial purposes, improving territory defense and protection of offspring –
vital behaviors for individual and species survival. However, experience can also promote pathological levels
of persistent aggression. In humans, this can harm an individual’s mental health and put others at risk. Thus,
there is a need for improved treatment options based on an individual’s prior and on-going history with
aggression. Accordingly, my goal is to identify how aggressive experience alters neural circuit computations
to generate persistent aggressive behavior. Specifically, this work will probe how experience changes
synaptic connectivity and neural activity between two subcortical regions that play critical roles in social
behavior: the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and medial preoptic area (MPOA). The
VMHvl neural activity is necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior. The MPOA is an influential node
regulating many social behaviors and sends the largest source of GABAergic input to the VMHvl.
Nevertheless, the role of the MPOA in aggression is enigmatic, and it remains unknown if MPOA inhibitory
input to VMHvl can shut down, or gate, aggression or how social experience affects this circuit. To study the
MPOA VMHvl circuit, this proposal combines: (1) ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology for optogenetic-
assisted circuit mapping and quantification of experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength within the
MPOA VMHvl circuit; (2) cell-type and pathway specific calcium recordings in socially interacting mice ; (3)
novel algorithms for tracking animal posture dynamics and subsequent methods for unsupervised behavior
detection and quantification; and, (4) in vivo optogenetic manipulations to identify the changes in circuit
function that link aggressive experience to future persistent aggression. Aim 1 tests the ability of aggressive
experience to relax the strength of the synaptic connections between MPOA GABAergic (MPOAvgat) input to
distinct, genetically-identified populations of VMHvl neurons. Aim 2 determines if aggressive experience
increases in vivo aggression-related VMHvl population activity. Finally, Aim 3 tests the ability of MPOAvgat
neurons to gate aggression before and after aggressive experience. Taken together, these experiments will
achieve the long-term objective of identifying novel circuit and synaptic treatment targets for aggression-
related pathologies based on patients’ behavioral history. Completion of this fellowship will achieve Dr.
Guthman’s training goals, providing her with experimental expertise in systems neuroscience to complement
her current command of single neuron synaptic physiology. The proposed plan will provide her with the
training to tackle social neuroscience research questions from synapse to behavior."
10769542,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide and are
a significant cause of premature death, disability, and loss of quality-of-life. Novel technologies and
approaches to determine the mechanisms that cause or contribute to cardiovascular diseases have
become increasingly powerful, but these approaches have also become increasingly specialized.
Multidisciplinary efforts that bring together investigators with complementary knowledge, tools and skills
and integrate laboratory and patient-based research are essential for ongoing efforts to leverage
information about mechanisms of disease into rationale therapeutic approaches for treatment. Thus,
the need for broadly trained scientists who can adopt innovative technologies, assemble tools from
different disciplines, and bridge basic, translational, and clinical science is greater than ever. The
overall goal of the UCSF Training Program in the Molecular and Cellular Basis of Cardiovascular
Disease is to train a diverse group of investigators who will be at the forefront of cardiovascular
discovery and disease research. Toward this goal, this training program will: 1) attract talented
PhD-trained postdoctoral scientists from a broad national and international applicant pool and from an
outstanding group of MD- and MD/PhD-trained researchers from UCSF's Cardiology and other clinical
fellowships to postdoctoral training in cardiovascular research; and 2) leverage the strong
multidisciplinary research environment in UCSF’s Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) to provide
outstanding scientific training in the context of research programs focused on cardiovascular biology
and disease. The Program brings together a diverse and outstanding group of mentors with a
common interest in cardiovascular biology and a commitment to mentorship and training of a diverse
group of postdoctoral scientists. The heart of this training program is formulation and execution of a
substantial research project relevant to cardiovascular biology and development of professional skills
under the guidance of a faculty mentor. The Training Program includes state-of-the-art, cutting edge
research opportunities in laboratories that span basic, translational, and patient-based,
clinical research. Program trainees benefit from the cohesive, multidisciplinary training
environment in CVRI, and the robust intellectual and scientific environment in the CVRI and at UCSF
more generally. Trainees also benefit from co-mentoring, peer-mentoring, ready access to collaborators
and colleagues with overlapping but complementary interests and expertise, and extensive and robust
didactic training in the Responsible Conduct of Research, Training in Clinical Research, if
appropriate, and a strong emphasis on reproducibility and rigor in scientific examination."
10770672,"The rise in multidrug resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae, the third leading cause of hospital-acquired
pneumonia in adults, has resulted in limited treatment options for K. pneumoniae-related infections. Therefore,
development of alternative therapeutic strategies, such as those enhancing host immune responses, would
greatly benefit affected patient populations. Given sex differences observed in host responses to other bacterial
pathogens, consideration of such differences in K. pneumoniae infection is essential for developing broadly
effective immunotherapies targeting this pathogen. Our preliminary data indicate that in response to the MDR K.
pneumoniae strain ST258, female mice have a sixfold higher mortality rate compared to males upon infection.
In addition, the lungs of healthy female mice have more T cells compared to males, including CD4+ helper T
lymphocytes, which help coordinate the immune response by stimulating macrophages, B lymphocytes, and
CD8 T lymphocytes. Primary infection with K. pneumoniae is controlled via lymphoid activation, including natural
killer (NK) cells, gamma-delta T cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Given previous studies demonstrating
that females elicit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than males, it is possible that increases in
lymphoid populations (including T cells, NK cells, and ILCs) contribute to immune-induced pathologies and a
higher mortality rate from K. pneumoniae infection in female versus male mice. Defining the mechanisms
underlying sex differences in the immune response to MDR K. pneumoniae would enable development of
treatments with sex-based precision efficacy. The objectives of this Research Project are to elucidate the
mechanisms that contribute to greater susceptibility of female versus male mice to MDR ST258 K. pneumoniae
pathogenesis and characterize sex differences in immune response to a new K. pneumoniae vaccine. The
central hypothesis is that estrogen-dependent increases in lung lymphocytes (T cells, NK cells, and ILCs) in
healthy females lead to greater inflammation upon ST258 primary infection and more robust immune responses
to a tissue resident memory CD4+ T cell-eliciting vaccine. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that estrogens
mediate the inflammatory immune responses in K. pneumoniae-infected female mice. Specific Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that estrogens produce a stronger immune response to a mucosal K. pneumoniae vaccine in female
compared to male mice. Host immune responses to infection and vaccination will be evaluated using male,
female, and ovariectomized female mice. In addition, single-cell RNAseq will define estrogen-related genes and
pathways that contribute to sex differences in host response to infection. Completion of the proposed research,
which is aligned with the Tulane COBRE in Sex-Based Precision Medicine (SPM) focus, will elucidate the
pathways that drive sex differences in response to infection and vaccination, ultimately facilitating development
of sex-based precision therapies to treat K. pneumoniae infection in humans."
10771216,"Conventional chemotherapy has been thought to act through the direct killing of tumor cells. However,
accumulating evidence indicates that immune competence is crucially required for chemotherapy efficacy. It is
expected that loss of this immunity during chemotherapy has a negative effect on its efficacy. Therefore, the
impact of chemotherapy on anti-tumor immunity needs further investigation in order to rationally design
combinatorial regimens for conventional chemotherapy. In the preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that
repeated chemodrug gemcitabine (GEM) treatment promoted the expansion and differentiation of
immunosuppressive Ly6Chigh monocytic-MDSC (M-MDSC). Tumor-derived soluble factors, such as GM-CSF and
soluble ICAM-1(sICAM-1), were up-regulated upon chemo-drug treatment. In tumor-free naïve mice, GEM
treatment induced the immunosuppressive activity of Ly6Chigh myeloid cells in the bone marrow (BM). The
chemokine CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 expression levels were elevated in the BM. Higher levels of
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were also observed in tumor cells and BM stromal cells following
chemotherapy. Furthermore, chemotherapy induced NF-κB activation leading to the hyperproduction of GM-CSF
by tumor cells. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that chemotherapy enhances the production of
mtROS in tumor cells and BM stromal cells, which increases the expressions of GM-CSF and sICAM-1 as well
as CX3CL1 leading to the enhanced immunosuppression of M-MDSC in the TME. These hypotheses will be
addressed by two Specific Aims. Aim 1 defines the roles of GM-CSF and sICAM-1 in chemotherapy-induced
differentiation of immunosuppressive Ly6Chigh myeloid cells and the mechanisms underlying mtROS and
upregulation of GM-CSF and sICAM-1 in tumor cells; Aim 2 determines the mechanisms by which host cell-
derived chemokine CX3CL1 regulates the accumulation and immunosuppressive function of inflammatory
Ly6Chigh myeloid cells in the BM. The findings from these studies will allow us to gain a better understanding the
underlying mechanisms by which ongoing inflammation following multi-dose clinical regimens of chemotherapy
modulates anti-tumor immunity, and rationally design a novel therapeutic approach by combining chemotherapy
with mitochondria-targeted antioxidants for cancer treatment."
10771217,"ABSTRACT 
Despite having been approved as first and second line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anti-PD- 
1 antibodies still fail in a substantial proportion of lung cancer patients. The mechanism that underlies the failure 
of anti-PD-1 therapy in the majority of NSCLC patients is not yet fully understood. We have discovered that, in 
the anti-PD-1-resistant LSL-KrasG12D murine lung adenocarcinoma mouse model, treatment induces a T-cell 
activation profile that favors Th17/γδT17 reinvigoration over CD8+ T cell activation. In contrast, when 
administered in conjunction with an anti-IL-17 neutralizing antibody, anti-PD-1 treatment results in a dramatic 
enhancement of CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity with near-complete eradication of established disease. These findings 
provide the premise for our central hypothesis that in NSCLC, the failure of anti-PD-1 is, at least in part, due to 
reinvigoration of PD-1+ type 17 T cells (Th17/γδT17), which actively undermine anti-PD-1-mediated restoration 
of cytotoxic function in CD8+ T-cells. Based on additional murine data, we are also advancing the extended 
hypothesis that the severity of pre-existing T17 activity in the neoplastic lung is determined by commensal 
bacteria and that the lung microbiota signature can ultimately predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. The 
goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the relevance of these findings to human prior to initiating an R01 
application. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will establish whether intrinsic lung T17/CTL ratio is predictive of anti-PD- 
1 responsiveness in NSCLC patients independent of neoantigen burden. In Aim 2 we will determine whether 
specific human lung microbiota, individually or in defined combinations, drive the ontogeny of intrinsic T17 
immunity and ultimately resistance to ICI therapy. The proposed study is conceptually impactful as it addresses 
an important clinical conundrum; is mechanistically novel; and has translational relevance since it introduces 
therapeutic/prognostic approaches that can rapidly move to the clinic."
10771219,"Lung cancer is a prevalent disease and consumes many lives every year. Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs; e.g. anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic lung cancer, resulting in long-term complete responses for many patients. Nevertheless, there remains an urgent need for new strategies because not all patients respond to ICIs; moreover, resistance can occur in those that do. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), in particular, monocytic MDSCs (MMDSCs) are potent immunosuppressive innate immune cells that actively inhibit CD8+ T cell tumor homing and activation. Since M-MDSC levels are elevated in multiple human cancers and correlate with decreased patient survival, we postulate that these cells contribute to anti-PD-1 resistance. The purine nucleoside, adenosine, is produced in copious amounts within the tumor microenvironment (TME), where it serves to suppress the immune system and promote tumor growth. There is evidence to suggest that overproduction of adenosine can mediate resistance to ICIs. Immune suppressive adenosine is produced via the enzymatic conversion of extracellular AMP by the cell surface enzyme, CD73 (ecto-5’-nucleotidase; AMP → adenosine). Our preliminary studies demonstrate that tumor cell-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) maintains M-MDSC suppressive activity, in large part, by directly inducing cell surface CD73 expression via a novel PGE2→cAMP→CREB/STAT3 pathway leading to increased immune suppressive adenosine within the TME. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that tumor cell-derived PGE2 dictates CD73 expression in M-MDSCs leading to substantial increases in adenosine-dependent inhibition of anti-tumor CD8+ T cell activation resulting, ultimately, in anti-PD-1 immunotherapeutic resistance A major goal of this proposal is to test the antitumor efficacy of a novel cancer immunotherapy involving systemic administration of adenosine deaminase (ADA)—an enzyme that irreversibly converts adenosine into inosine, a non-immunosuppresive nucleoside. A pegylated version of bovine ADA (PEG-ADA) is already FDA-approved for use as an enzyme replacement therapy in children with ADA-associated severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). We hypothesize that depletion of adenosine-mediated T cell immune suppression by PEG-ADA sensitizes tumors to PD-1 inhibitor therapy and improves clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients. To fulfill the stated objectives, the following aims are proposed: 1) Delineate the signaling pathway and molecular mechanisms by which PGE2 induces CD73 expression in M-MDSCs; 2) Determine whether inhibition of the PGE2→cAMP→CREB/STAT3→CD73→adenosine pathway attenuates anti-PD-1 resistance in a mouse model of lung cancer; and 3) Validate PGE2 → CD73+ M-MDSC → adenosine mediated anti-PD-1 resistance pathway in lung cancer patients receiving pembrolizumab therapy. Our proposed study will provide important insights towards developing a safe and novel immunotherapy to attenuate ICI resistance in lung cancer patients."
10790184,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that affects social behavior and
cognitive flexibility. Sleep disruption is a common comorbidity in ASD, observed in more than 80% of affected
individuals. It has been debated whether sleep disruption in ASD is a consequence of altered brain function, or
whether sleep disruption is actually a core component of ASD and driver of altered brain function and behavior.
Sleep disruption is often seen in advance of ASD diagnosis, and the severity of sleep disruption can be
predicative of the severity of other ASD associated phenotypes, strongly suggesting that sleep disruption is an
early symptom in ASD and a potential driver of the condition. Multiple studies, including new work from our lab,
have shown in animal models (rodents and fruit flies) that a period of early life sleep disruption is causal in long-
lasting and sex-specific changes in social and cognitive behaviors in adults. Thus, developmental sleep
disruption is emerging as an important contributor to ASD susceptibility. Alterations in synapse number,
structure, and function have been documented repeatedly in ASD models and patient samples, leading many to
describe ASD as a “synaptophathy”: a dysfunction of synapse function. Consistent with this assertion, gene
sequencing efforts have identified hundreds of risk genes associated with ASD, many of which encode proteins
with known synaptic functions, such as the excitatory synaptic scaffold protein SHANK3. Another important
cluster of ASD risk genes encode for proteins with nuclear functions such as CHD8. Sleep has been shown to
be critical for synapse formation, maturation and elimination in the developing brain. Therefore, we hypothesize
that synapse maturation is a critical vulnerability to the consequences of developmental sleep disruption. We
have recently published that early life sleep disruption (ELSD) can cause long-lasting and sex-specific changes
in behavior in the genetically vulnerable Shank3(+/C) heterozygous mice, whereas wild type littermates were
found to be resilient (Lord et al., 2022, Molecular Autism). To determine if developmental sleep disruption is
broadly relevant in ASD we must test whether ELSD similarly interacts with distinct genetic vulnerabilities. CHD8
is a high-confidence ASD risk gene that encodes a nuclear chromatin remodeling enzyme. CHD8 is believed to
play an important role in brain development during embryogenesis, but whether CHD8 mutation also confers
vulnerability to postnatal sleep disruption has not been tested. We will determine whether ELSD drives lasting
changes in behavior in genetically vulnerable Chd8(+/V986*) ASD model mice, similarly to what we have recently
demonstrated with heterozygous Shank3 ASD model mice. We will also examine whether postnatal synapse
maturation is a convergent node of vulnerability to developmental sleep disruption. Our goals in this R21 proposal
is to establish developmental sleep disruption as an important risk factor contributing to ASD susceptibility by
interacting with diverse underlying genetic etiologies, and to develop methodologies to pursue the developing
synapse as a convergent node of vulnerability to the effects of sleep disruption in ASD."
10777564,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Statins reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. However, providers fail to
prescribe statin therapy for about half of patients meeting guideline criteria for initiation. The electronic health
record (EHR) creates opportunities to develop clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to support
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk recognition, assessment, and management. However, low provider adoption
has limited the clinical impact of CDSSs designed to improve guideline-concordant statin prescribing.
Integrating insights from behavioral economics into CDSS design represents a novel approach to improving
adoption by minimizing key barriers - provider time and cognitive load burden. Behavioral economics studies
the effects of psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors on the decisions of individuals and uses
nudges to influence behavior at a largely unconscious level. Nudges are defined as positive reinforcement and
indirect suggestions which have a non-forced effect on decision-making. For example, “opt-out” options for
organ donation consent lead to striking differences in enrollment. Nudges represent an exciting and novel
approach to developing CDSSs that minimize provider burden and are, therefore, more efficient, scalable, and
impactful (i.e., optimized). The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and optimize a CDSS, including
several nudges, to increase guideline-concordant statin prescribing for CVD risk (Nudge-CVD-CDSS). We use
an innovative, engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to arrive at an
intervention that is not just efficacious or effective but efficient and scalable. Several potential intervention
components (EHR-nudges) will be developed, usability tested, revised, and evaluated. A randomized trial
using a specialized design will evaluate the individual and combined effects of nudges. We will seek the
combination of nudges that maximizes impact on guideline-concordant statin prescribing while minimizing
provider time and cognitive load burden. Specific Aims: 1) To develop, based on a conceptual model of the
prescribing process, a set of potential intervention components (EHR-nudges) to promote and support
AHA/ACC guideline-concordant statin prescribing, 2) To revise potential intervention components through
iterative usability testing, including real-time measures of provider time and cognitive load burden and 3) To
use a randomized trial with a specialized design to identify which EHR-nudges, or combinations of nudges,
contribute most efficiently to AHA/ACC guideline-concordant statin prescribing. The proposed work is
significant in its efforts to develop an effective, efficient, and scalable intervention to improve guideline-
concordant care for CVD risk management. It is innovative in its use of insights from behavioral economics and
the MOST framework to optimize a CDSS by balancing clinical impact with provider time and cognitive load
burden. Achieving the project’s objectives will advance the science of CDSS design and development."

Luis A. Rodriguez, PhD, MPH, RD is a diabetes epidemiologist and Research Scientist I (equivalent to
Assistant Professor) at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research. His long-term goal is
to become an independent researcher with a focus on addressing disparities in type 2 diabetes, particularly
among the US Latino population (defined as persons whose origins are in Latin America). Approximately 22%
of Latino adults are affected by type 2 diabetes compared to 12% of White adults. An additional 38% of Latino
adults have prediabetes, a state of increased diabetes risk, and may face more barriers to participation in
effective type 2 diabetes prevention interventions. Engagement in evidenced-based diabetes prevention
programs has historically been low, particularly in Latino populations. Developing prediction tools specific to
this population using readily available data from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the highest-risk
patients, along with stakeholder engagement to identify how these tools can be used to improve participation in
diabetes prevention programs, is a promising approach towards improving diabetes health equity. The
proposed research aims to build a large cohort of Latino patients at risk for type 2 diabetes and: 1) develop and
validate type 2 diabetes risk prediction models using EHR data that uniquely incorporate non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), social determinants of health factors, and their interaction; 2) evaluate social
determinants of health and other clinical factors important for type 2 diabetes prevention program enrollment
and engagement; and 3) identify how these models can be used by patients, clinicians and healthcare systems
to reduce incident diabetes. A major strength of the proposed research is that model development and
application will be conducted in an integrated healthcare system serving over 4.5 million members with a
strong record of successfully implementing EHR-based clinical support tools. This will be followed by validation
in an external cohort of Latino adults to assess generalizability. To support the proposed research and Dr.
Rodriguez’s goal of future independent research in type 2 diabetes disparities, this K01 proposal includes a
formal, mentored training program to: 1) acquire specialized training in advanced predictive modeling (machine
learning) using EHR data; 2) develop content expertise in the social determinants of prediabetes and NAFLD;
and 3) train in implementation science to gain expertise in translation and adoption of research into clinical
practice. The evidence generated from this work will form the foundation for an R01 application to test
strategies that will increase engagement in type 2 diabetes prevention programs and reduce diabetes
incidence in the Latino population. In summary, the proposed K01 award will advance diabetes prevention
health equity for Latino patients and provide vital support for the career development of Dr. Rodriguez by
helping him acquire the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator."

Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury and subsequent reconstruction result in disrupted neuromuscular
pathways which have been linked to protracted quadriceps weakness and atrophy. There is a significant gap in
knowledge concerning the signaling cascades that precipitate peripheral quadriceps deficits, limiting progress
in the field to address the inceptive events underlying poor functional recovery. Lacking mechanistic evidence
hinders the development of targeted rehabilitation protocols to address quadriceps atrophy and weakness that
often persist far beyond return to activity. Pilot data in this proposal has identified a molecular signature of
quadriceps neuromuscular dysfunction that appears following the initial ACL injury and is further exacerbated
by reconstruction. Early molecular changes following ACL reconstruction culminate in local quadriceps
denervation and weakness. Additionally, provided data show this molecular signature to be responsive to
neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), providing a heretofore previously unknown mechanistic target of
NMES. Conflicting results from studies lacking rigor and mechanistic insight have limited the efficacy and
utilization of NMES following ACL injury, hindering its therapeutic potential. The overarching hypothesis of this
proposal is that ACL injury results in rapid quadriceps neuromuscular remodeling and local denervation, which
results in subsequent quadriceps atrophy and weakness. Further, NMES is hypothesized to mitigate
denervation-induced molecular signaling within the quadriceps, providing critical mechanistic insight. Three
interconnected but independent aims will address the overarching hypothesis. Specifically, innovative pre-
clinical gain and loss of function experiments will establish causative roles for specific signaling cascades
within the quadriceps that are critical for responsiveness to NMES. Additionally, a rigorous and targeted clinical
trial will address gaps in knowledge surrounding NMES that have previously limited acceptance and utilization.
Results of the current study will provide necessary mechanistic insight to overcome a critical barrier in the
development of evidence-based guidelines. Results from this work will directly lead to new testable treatments
to advance the care of individuals with ACL injuries that will remedy the pervasive issue of protracted
quadriceps weakness."
10922730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke typically have significant upper extremity motor impairments. These
impairments include “associated reactions” and abnormal “muscle synergies”, characterized by inter- and intra-
limb muscle coactivation patterns, respectively. It has been postulated that these motor impairments are due to
an upregulation of the contralesional cortico-reticulospinal tract (CRST), after stroke-inflicted damage to
corticofugal pathways. Neuroimaging in the brain, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electromyography (EMG) studies, have widely substantiated this hypothesis, while leaving a tangible gap
between measures of cortical neural function and skeletal muscle coactivation patterns. To our knowledge,
neural activity in the spinal cord has not been investigated in the context of post-stroke motor impairments.
Therefore, it is critical to integrate advanced fMRI methods in the human spinal cord with EMG techniques to
investigate an increased reliance on the CRST in chronic hemiparetic stroke.
The objectives of this research proposal are to investigate the neural mechanisms of post-stroke motor
impairment and long-term to inform development of more targeted therapeutic interventions. If upregulation of
the CRST is responsible for force generation in the paretic upper extremity, its characteristic bilateral and
unilateral projections would be expected to drive associated reactions when activating the non-paretic hand, and
muscle synergies in the paretic limb when activating the paretic hand. Spinal cord fMRI can provide direct insight
into neural activation and motor pathway use in the human cervical spinal cord. In the proposed project,
participants will perform unilateral isometric hand-grasping tasks; muscle activation will be measured with EMG
and spinal cord neural activity will be measured with fMRI. Aim 1 will investigate the relationship of associated
reactions and the lateralization of spinal cord neural activity. CRST-driven associated reactions are expected to
elicit increased inter-limb muscle coactivation and more bilateral spinal cord neural activation when performing
the task with the non-paretic hand. Aim 2 will investigate the relationship of abnormal motor synergies and the
longitudinal extent of motor activation. Synergies driven by diffuse unilateral CRST projections are expected to
elicit increased intra-limb muscle coactivation and an increased longitudinal extent of spinal cord activation.
To execute this research project, the applicant will gain expertise in the neuropathophysiology of stroke and
EMG, receive mentorship from experts in neuroscience and magnetic resonance imaging, and train in scientific
communication, mentorship, and leadership. Northwestern University’s collaborative medical campus, with
neuroimaging experts and state-of-the art research-dedicated MRI scanners, fosters a complete environment for
scientific training and innovative research. The novel implementation of advanced spinal cord fMRI techniques
will inform our understanding and treatment of stereotypical movement patterns in chronic hemiparetic stroke."
10938613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Understanding the general rules of adaptation has implications for treating diseases caused by evolving
entities such as cancer and drug-resistant infections. In attempts to uncover these general rules, previous
research has revealed a seemingly paradoxical phenomenon. On the one hand, under selective pressure,
adaptive mutations arise quickly, have large fitness effects, localize to a few functionally similar genes, and
likely exploit the same adaptive strategy. On the other hand, laboratory-evolved organisms show a wide range
of diverse physiological changes. This means that directional selection increases rather than decreases
phenotypic diversity. This phenomenon likely explains our limited ability to predict the effectiveness of
anticancer therapies, because even genetically similar cancers can have highly diverse physiologies. In this
project, I will use a collection of several hundred well-studied adaptive S. cerevisiae mutants, isolated from a
single evolution experiment, to test two mechanistic hypotheses of how selection might generate diversity. My
working hypothesis is that selection generates diversity through combinatorial loss of plastic responses. The
alternative hypothesis is that selection generates diversity through the gain of novel responses.
 To distinguish between these two hypotheses, I will measure the molecular phenotypes of the adaptive
mutants with two RNA sequencing technologies. In Aim 1, I will use bulk RNA sequencing on 10 carefully
selected mutants, grown in the environment in which they evolved, in order to gain the first insight into the
molecular mechanism of their adaptive strategy. In Aim 2, I will use a state-of-the-art, high-throughput,
barcode-aware RNA sequencing approach called Split-Seq to measure the full scope of the adaptive mutants'
phenotypes which are most prominent in various extreme environments. This will reveal if the adaptive mutants
achieve high fitness in the evolution environment and high diversity in other environments through loss of
plasticity or by creating novel responses. Uncovering the mechanism of how selection generates diversity will
contribute to our general understanding of adaptation and have implications for treating diseases driven by
evolutionary adaptation, such as cancer and drug-resistant infections.
 During my PhD, I received strong training in molecular genetics and learned basic wet lab skills but had
little exposure to evolutionary theory or genomics. Undertaking this project will greatly expand my conceptual
and technological toolkit, as I will learn molecular evolution and population genetics, as well as genomics
methods like barcode tracking and RNA sequencing. I will receive formal and informal training in evolutionary
theory, programming, genomics data analysis, grant writing, and professional leadership. This will prepare me
to become an independent researcher and leader in the interdisciplinary field of molecular and evolutionary
biology."

Despite their high prevalence, the underlying neurobiology of substance use disorders is still not understood,
limiting effective pharmacological treatment options. Characterized by disruptions in learning processes,
substance use disorders are thought to develop with the transition from being motivated by the positive
reinforcing effects of the substance, to negative reinforcement where use occurs to avoid or alleviate an aversive
state during abstinence. It is hypothesized that substance-induced upregulations in kappa opioid receptor (KOR)
signaling play a causal role in the dysphoria that drives negative reinforcement. In support of this idea, KOR
antagonists decrease drug intake in models of chronic use or dependence and the nucleus accumbens, a region
critical to reinforcement learning and motivated behaviors, is one of the regions in which substance use has been
shown to upregulate the KOR system. Despite this evidence of a causal role for KOR signaling in substance use
disorders, this system’s function in adaptive reinforcement processes and the sufficiency of its upregulation in
driving maladaptive learning remains unknown. Here, we aim to address these issues through direct investigation
of the role of the KOR system in positive and negative reinforcement learning through pharmacological
manipulation, sub-second measurement of in vivo dynorphin dynamics, and optogenetic activation of the KOR
system. In aim 1, I will pair systemic antagonism of the KOR system with positive and negative reinforcement
operant conditioning tasks to elucidate the role of KOR signaling in adaptive learning. In aim 2, I will conduct
sub-second resolution, in vivo optical imaging of dynorphin release in the nucleus accumbens to uncover the
role of endogenous KOR system activity in encoding information during reinforcement learning processes.
Finally, in aim 3, I will optogenetically evoke accumbal dynorphin release to determine the sufficiency of
augmentation of the KOR system in driving the maladaptive learning that underlies addiction. Through the
completion of this proposal, I will receive well-rounded training in conducting independent research and
contribute to the field of addiction neuroscience’s understanding of the mechanism by which the KOR system is
involved in adaptive and maladaptive reinforcement learning processes."

Neutrophils are the most abundant and predominantly-infected cell type in the sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid, and caseum contents from resected lung tissue of active tuberculosis (TB) patients. Studies of TB in
mice, non-human primates, and humans have identified a correlation between neutrophil abundance and
increased disease severity. Although there is a growing appreciation for the association of increased neutrophil
abundance with active TB disease, it was still unknown if the presence of neutrophils in the lungs of active TB
patients is consequential, or if the neutrophils are bystanders reacting to an uncontrolled infection. In particular,
the details on how specific neutrophil responses and effector functions impact TB disease have remained
elusive. In response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, neutrophils deploy a number of defenses
including the extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) via a process of cell death termed NETosis.
NETosis usually follows the general steps of 1) histone citrullination, 2) chromatin decondensation, and 3)
release of web-like chromatin structures decorated with antimicrobial granule proteins with the potential to
bind, trap, and kill pathogens. We have recently discovered that NETosis directly promotes Mtb
replication, where genetic or chemical inhibition of NETosis mediates better control of Mtb infection in vitro and
in vivo, thus validating NETosis as a potential target for host-directed therapies to treat TB. We have used
genetic and chemical approaches to mechanistically dissect the process of NETosis during Mtb infection,
which has identified a number of regulatory nodes that can be manipulated to lead to better control of Mtb
pathogenesis. We find that in response to Mtb infection in neutrophils, protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)
citrullinates histones to decondense chromatin that gets packaged into vesicles for release as NETs in a
manner that promotes Mtb replication. We discovered that type I interferon (IFN), which has been associated
with NETosis in numerous contexts but without a known mechanism, promotes the formation of
chromatin-containing vesicles and NET release. In addition, we discovered a new autophagy-independent
role for the ATG5 protein in suppressing NETosis by blocking type I IFN-dependent induction of PAD4 activity
during Mtb infection, where increased NETosis in the absence of ATG5 expression in neutrophils leads to
susceptibility to Mtb. Multiple studies have linked increased levels of type I IFN signaling with TB pathology in
mice and humans. Based on our data that NETosis promotes Mtb replication and pathogenesis, NETosis
could contribute to the ways that type I IFN signaling impedes control of Mtb infection. In this proposal, we
will dissect how NETosis is regulated during Mtb infection (Aim 1), how NETosis contributes to Mtb replication
(Aim 2), and how NETosis contributes to loss of control of infection (Aim 3). By pursuing our Aims, we will
identify regulatory mechanisms to be targeted by HDTs aimed at blocking NETosis during Mtb infection as well
as determine what consequences result from blocking NETosis during Mtb infection."

Cigarettes are used by over 34 million U.S. adults and cause more than 480,000 deaths annually due to
smoking and smoke exposure. Despite smoking at similar rates and consuming less cigarettes per day, African
Americans are more likely to die from several tobacco-caused cancers compared to Whites. Quitting smoking
reduces the risk of premature death and adds years to life expectancy; however, a disparity exists in annual
quit rates between African Americans and Whites (4.9% vs. 7.1%). This disparity is due to several social
determinants. Thus, it is critical to investigate scalable, evidence-based strategies to increase smoking
cessation among African Americans. African Americans are twice as likely to use quitlines compared to
Whites. However, little is known about the impact of mHealth interventions among African Americans using
quitlines. In preliminary studies conducted by Penn State investigators, we found that automated text
messaging was feasible for monitoring smoking status and providing smoking cessation support. However,
these studies were not designed to assess the impact of interventions in minority populations. A recent study
compared engagement and abstinence rates between Black and White smokers in a national texting cessation
program and found that Blacks were just as likely as Whites to enroll and remain in the program; yet Blacks
were less likely to respond to abstinence assessments and report cessation. Few studies have focused on the
behaviors and perceptions of quitline texting services among African Americans. The current project proposes
to assess data from the Pennsylvania quitline to inform a tailored mHealth smoking cessation intervention. The
overall goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to build on the candidate’s advanced
postdoctoral training by developing her expertise to investigate and alleviate disparities in tobacco-related
disease for racial minorities through the use of technology interventions. Career development objectives are to
develop expertise in: 1) mHealth applications for smoking cessation, 2) qualitative data analysis, and 3) clinical
research skills in ecological momentary assessment. The central hypothesis is that social determinants will
explain differences in smoking abstinence between African Americans and White smokers using technology as
a cessation aid. The specific aims for this study will be to 1) conduct a secondary analysis of the PA quitline
texting program data and provide an overview of service engagement and smoking rates during enrollment and
at 6-month follow-up; 2) to conduct qualitative interviews with African Americans who enrolled in the PA quitline
texting program to better understand the factors that serve as barriers to engagement and abstinence; 3) To
conduct a pilot EMA study to inform a tailored mHealth smoking cessation intervention for African Americans.
The research environment is an academic medical center with the facilities, technology, resources, and
advanced equipment to support the research and training proposed in this award."
10748377,"Summary: Approximately 1.5% of individuals have a Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) that can result in insufficient
blood flow and organ damage (1, 2). A BAV is also an independent risk factor for ascending aortic wall
complications that can lead to rupture and sudden death. However, the cell and molecular basis for the BAV is
unknown. Even basic aspects of BAV formation are undefined due to contributions from multiple cell lineages
and a lack of highly penetrant viable BAV mouse models. Dysfunctional aortic valves exhibit massive
accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans versican (Vcan) and aggrecan (Acan) (3-7) but the
origin and consequence of excess proteoglycans is largely unknown. Since proteoglycans are highly stable,
abundance is regulated primarily by proteolytic degradation which led us to investigate a role for proteoglycan
cleavage. We discovered that loss of a single ECM proteoglycanase, Adamts5, results in enlarged aortic valves
with ascending aortopathies (100%). These defects co-localize with substantial increases in Vcan and Acan in
the affected tissues (8-10) that mirror the human condition. Mechanistically, in Adamts5-/- aortic valve primordia
with excess Vcan there is a reduction of pSmad2, and when Smad2 is reduced further by generating Adamts5-/-
;Smad2+/- mice, there is a high penetrance of BAV (75%), much higher than seen in other mouse BAV models.
The objective of this proposal is to utilize the viable Adamts5-/-;Smad2+/- mice that exhibit a high percentage of
BAV, to define morphological events, cell behaviors and factors that when disrupted contribute to BAV formation.
Since excess Vcan is a hallmark of dysfunctional and diseased valves, use of a model with mutations that impact
the control of Vcan content, may shed light on how proteoglycan metabolism is regulated in development and
may also give insight into disease. Experiments test the hypothesis that ECM Vcan cleavage coordinates
mesenchymal cell behaviors and myocardial cell contributions that are required for the tricuspid morphology of
aortic valves. The hypothesis is tested in two aims: Aim 1 tests the impact of altered Vcan cleavage on
mesenchymal cell lineage behaviors that are required for aortic valve formation. Our preliminary data show that
loss of Vcan cleaved fragments and excess intact Vcan, disrupted lineage-specific patterning in the developing
aortic valves of the BAV Adamts5-/-;Smad2+/-mice. A combination of ex vivo, and in vivo approaches will decipher
the lineage-specific cell behaviors, and guidance factors that are dependent on Vcan cleavage and to prevent
BAV. Although dogma states that valve cusps arise from mesenchymal cells, Aim 2 investigates the
consequence of excess Vcan on the myocardial cell lineage contributions to the developing aortic valve in
Adamts5-/-;Smad2+/- mice and other murine models of BAV. Our preliminary data show myocardial lineage
expression of Adamts5 is required to clear Vcan-rich ECM and to form the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
Due to the emerging prevalence of excess Vcan in BAV, the investigation into ECM turnover will allow insight
into the molecular and cellular origins of aortic valve diseases, which may lead to therapeutic advances."
10747631,"Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by impaired patency of the
upper airway during sleep, resulting in numerous brief arousals from sleep and causing significant
disability, lost quality of life and premature mortality1. OSA affects approximately 4-6% of the
population nationwide 2, with higher rates among military Veterans 3, and an increase in
prevalence of nearly twofold between 2005 and 2014 among VA patients4. OSA has direct effects
on quality of life, health-care resources consumption and costs 5. Military Veterans who have been
diagnosed with OSA have greater risk of developing depressive and anxiety disorders 6 possibly
mediated by daytime consequences of poor sleep, such as fatigue and excessive daytime
sleepiness7. While effective at treating respiratory disturbances and providing symptoms
resolutions, treatment with Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) is not universally successful and a
non-negligible proportion of patients who are correctly using PAP do not experience symptomatic
relief from sleepiness and depression, suggesting that mechanisms beyond the respiratory
disturbances may be involved in the pathogenesis of symptoms leading to disability. A growing
body of literature in animal and human models suggests that the sleep and respiratory
disturbances commonly seen in OSA, namely sleep fragmentation, partial sleep deprivation,
intermittent hypoxia, can promote shifts in circadian rhythms ultimately leading to misalignment
between sleep-wake rhythms and the internal clock. Targeting the circadian disturbance with
chronotherapeutic interventions may improve symptoms that most affect daily functioning and
quality of life, ultimately preventing the downstream effects of OSA leading to disability.
Supplementary exposure to bright light has beneficial effects on sleep, daytime vigilance and
mood and it has been increasingly applied in a variety of sleep and neuropsychiatric conditions11
12. Our study is the first to use bright light therapy to improve sleep related functioning by reducing
the residual daytime symptoms most strongly linked to disability in patients with sleep apnea. We
will conduct a within-subjects crossover trial intervention to test the effects of BLT on and CPAP-
resistant symptoms of sleepiness and depression and sleep, sleep-related functional impairment
and quality of life in patients with OSA on CPAP therapy. We will also explore whether the
circadian phase shifting moderates the degree of changes in daytime symptoms and functional
impairment."
10925356,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) have a high HIV incidence and poor outcomes
along the entire HIV prevention and care cascades compared to adults. Despite the high HIV burden, both uptake
of oral PrEP (HIV negatives) and achieving viral suppression (HIV positives) are sub-optimal among youth in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Among youth in Uganda, uptake and persistence on oral PrEP is low, with reasons for
discontinuation including: pill burden, low perceived severity of HIV, need for partner or parental approval, HIV-
related stigma, fear of side-effects and health facility barriers.
Cabotegravir, a is new long-acting antiretroviral
(CAB-LA)
and highly efficacious PrEP choice that can mitigate barriers to use of daily oral PrEP. We propose to
evaluate evidence-based HIV prevention and care interventions to improve implementation outcomes among
high-risk AYA (15-24 years) in Uganda. The study covers the continuum of care, will use novel screening
methods for HIV risk, will involve teams that are highly experienced in youth-focused clinical trials and
implementation science (ImS), will implement MOH approved community differentiated service delivery models
for delivery CAB-LA, will evaluate the implementation of the SEARCH-Youth (SY), a multi-component
intervention comprising of life-stage based assessment and support to increase viral suppression in high-risk
AYA with HIV, and will use hybrid effectiveness implementation designs to assess these evidence-based
interventions. Our aims include: Aim 1: Using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR),
we will identify determinants of potential implementation success of two innovations: CAB-LA and SY
implementation at the community, clinic, provider, and patient levels in 5 geographically distinct sites in Uganda.
Aim 2a: Using a hybrid effectiveness implementation type II design, we will assess the uptake and persistence
of CAB-LA. We will conduct a randomized prospective study to assess effectiveness for the provision of CAB-
LA among high risk AYA. Effectiveness outcome will be proportion of study subjects who have initiated CAB-LA
and persisted at 18 months of follow-up comparing facility and community delivery options. Implementation
outcomes will be feasibility, acceptability, adoption and maintenance using RE-AIM. Aim 2b: Using a hybrid
effectiveness implementation type III design we will assess implementation (feasibility, adoption, fidelity, and
sustainment) and effectiveness of the SY intervention in increasing long-term virologic suppression (<200 c/mL)
at 18 months of follow-up in 5 CRPS using RE-AIM. Aim 3: We will use platforms in aims 1 and 2 to strengthen
capacity of ImS and to translate findings into policy and guidelines. Our study involves solid community and
institutional partnerships and builds on a strong multi-disciplinary team highly experienced in innovative methods
and implementation science in sub-Saharan Africa. The project, building on PATC3H and AHISA, is responsive
to WHO’s, Uganda’s MoH priorities regarding the gap in HIV services for highly vulnerable AYA. It will test a
novel, scalable and integrated approach to initiate and sustain support for high-risk AYA in LMIC."
10891720,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Tendon injury is a common problem characterized by slow recovery and high recurrence. Improving
tendon healing to a functionally effective state is therefore a crucial research priority, however the basic
biological mechanisms remain unknown. Our overall objective is therefore to identify the cellular and
molecular events that distinguish healing mechanisms to improve adult tendon healing.
 One key feature in all wound healing is the immune environment. Injury initially induces an inflammatory
type 1 response, followed by transition to an anti-inflammatory type 2 response. Imbalanced type 1 or
type 2 responses are often associated with fibrotic healing or degeneration. To date, T cells have
rarely been investigated, even though T cell subpopulations regulate type 1 and type 2 immune
responses, macrophage polarization, and in some cases can directly active tissue-resident stem cells. Due
to this gap in research, the mechanisms by which specific immune cell populations create
permissive environments for effective and poor healing are not known, especially for poor healing
tissues such as tendon.
 We previously established novel models of effective tendon healing (neonatal mouse) and
fibrosis (adult mouse), and identified cellular mechanisms that distinguish these. Based on rigorous pilot data,
we now hypothesize that T cell subpopulations mediate tendon healing through direct and indirect
interactions with tenocytes and by mediating effective tendon healing or chronic inflammation via IL33-
dependent mechanisms. To test these hypotheses, we will define the role of neonatal vs adult T cell
populations and T cell-tenocyte interactions after tendon injury (Aim 1), elucidate the mechanisms of Treg-
mediated resolution of IL33 in tendon healing (Aim 2), and determine the pathological consequences of
chronic IL33 inflammation in tendon healing (Aim 3)"
10908612,"SPECIFIC AIMS (Overall). The goal of the proposed Multilevel Interventions to Advance Maternal Health Equity
(MIRACLE) Center is to reduce pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated maternal morbidity and mortality
(PRAMM) disparities in African American, Hispanic, and rural populations through innovative and culturally rel-
evant community-partnered effectiveness and implementation research. This Center will address the need for
multilevel, community-centered, equity-focused interventions developed and tested with an emphasis on scala-
bility and sustainment to address PRAMM disparities. The proposed MIRACLE Center is innovative because it:
(1) tests complementary, multilevel pregnancy-to-postpartum interventions operating across multiple health sys-
tems and settings; (2) addresses and measures a wide range of PRAMM conditions (including non-severe mor-
bidity and pregnancy-associated mortality, which are less commonly measured), as well as severe maternal
morbidity (SMM) and pregnancy-related mortality; (3) analyzes main effects within each project and synergistic
effects across projects, which target different levels and sources of disparities; (4) uses a statewide linked Med-
icaid dataset (claims, vital records, screening data) to evaluate common outcomes, allowing for data harmoni-
zation across projects and with other Centers nationally; and (5) focuses on the understudied implementation
science concepts of scale-up and sustainment. The Center is significant because it: (1) develops and tests novel
approaches to addressing determinants of inequities at multiple levels and in multiple systems, (2) tests these
population-level equity-focused interventions in 20 Michigan counties, covering a population of >7 million; and
(3) uses an equitably partnered Center structure, with academic and health system or community PIs of the
Center and of each component. All these features enhance utility and impact of the proposed work. Through
three R01-scope projects implementing and testing multilevel interventions, and Community Partnership and
Training Components the Center will accomplish the following Aims: (1) Evaluate effectiveness, cost-effective-
ness, implementation, and population-wide impact of innovative and culturally relevant multilevel interventions
to eliminate PRAMM disparities through three R01-scope projects; (2) Generate and scale innovative ap-
proaches & partnerships for eliminating PRAMM disparities; (3) Maximize scalability, sustainability, cultural rel-
evance, and broad dissemination of identified approaches; (4) Increase research, practice, and policy capacity
for eliminating PRAMM disparities. This Center is rooted in a culturally informed multi-disciplinary Research
Community with involvement of longstanding community, health, and policy partners in all phases of the Center’s
work, and partnership with Black and Hispanic Medicaid-eligible mothers and their families in urban and rural
settings. With in-kind financial support from academic and health institutions, the Center will generate scalable
and sustainable approaches for saving maternal lives and ending preventable and unequal maternal suffering."

developed with our partners in these counties, including NHB and Hispanic pregnant persons, community lead-
ers, providers, and health system representatives. Community level intervention. We will enhance a commu-
nity health worker (CHW)-inclusive home visiting model by increasing pre- and postnatal focus on maternal
health and by designing and implementing specific CHW interventions to directly address PRAMM equity in
Black and Hispanic Medicaid birthing persons. This approach takes advantage of existing statewide infrastruc-
tures in MI and many other states to expand the reach of maternal health disparities interventions. The pro-
vider/practice level intervention will address patient-provider interactions through actionable, experiential pro-
vider trainings focused on communication (e.g. listening to birthing persons), provider and practice racism, bias,
cultural relevance, and awareness of and referrals to community care services including CHWs and home visit-
ing, for both clinical and community settings. The study is innovative in that (i) it is the first large-scale test of a
scalable and integrated CHW – home visiting program specifically designed for reducing PRAMM and disparities
among NHB and Hispanic birthing persons; (ii) will include interventions for specific comorbid conditions relevant
to PRAMM and disparities, including multimorbidity; (iii) will be one of the first to address patient-provider inter-
actions both from the provider and patient perspective and will incorporate innovative upstream provider training
methods such as community health detailing; (iv) and will enhance the coordination of clinical and community
care at multiple levels. The study will use a quasi-experimental, stepped wedge design. Participants will be
Medicaid insured persons in Wayne, Kent, and Genesee counties observed during pregnancy, at birth, and up
to 1 year postpartum, who deliver a birth between 2021-2028 (~101,000 births, including ~39,000 NHB and
Hispanic). Analyses will use a statewide linked data system including all Medicaid birth and death records, Med-
icaid claims, and other program data. In the context of Michigan extending pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage
to 12 months postpartum starting in 2022, the study will be able to evaluate the impact of the proposed multilevel
intervention vs usual care from early pregnancy through 12 months postpartum. Specific aims are to: (1) Assess
the effectiveness of the intervention (vs usual care) in reducing NHB and Hispanic PRAMM (up to 1-year post-
partum; overall & relative to NHW persons) and NHB and Hispanic severe maternal morbidity and pregnancy-
associated (which includes pregnancy-related) mortality (overall & relative to NHW persons); (2) Test access to
care, quality, and social conditions as mechanisms of the effect of the multilevel intervention on NHB and His-
panic PRAMM disparities; (3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the multilevel intervention."

any other high-income country, particularly in rural areas and among non-Hispanic (NH) Black birthing people.
Technology has clear potential for reduction of PRAMM by providing screening, tailored digital content,
and connection to live assistance. Digital approaches also provide tremendous scalability and potential for
long-term optimization. Finally, technology that is sufficiently flexible and easy to use—as is the platform used in
this project—can also support deep community input through direct content creation. The proposed study builds
upon an existing app (the Pregnancy Checkup) developed by project PI Ondersma, already integrated with
antenatal services throughout Michigan, that provides universal digital screening for health risks, a brief
motivational intervention, and referral to services. The proposed project will create the Pregnancy Checkup-
PRAMM (PC-PRAMM) by extending the Pregnancy Checkup in two ways: (1) adding elements to address key
determinants of PRAMM risks at four distinct levels (individual, support system, provider, and community), with
further optimization to address the needs of Black pregnant people and those residing in underserved rural areas;
and (2) providing pregnant participants with immediate and secure “live chat” text access to a Community Health
Worker who can facilitate warm handoffs to local services. Development of PC-PRAMM will use an innovative
community partnered approach to co-creating app content. The PC-PRAMM will target known preventable
determinants of PRAMM at four levels throughout pregnancy and the first year postpartum. Our first specific
aim is to collaborate with pregnant and postpartum people (including people of color and those from
rural areas), healthcare providers, family members, and researchers to develop the PC-PRAMM, including
a manual for CHWs providing live chat assistance and facilitating engagement in services. Our second specific
aim is to evaluate PC-PRAMM effects using a cluster randomized design in 10 geographically and
demographically diverse antenatal care clinics throughout Michigan (N = 500 participants receiving Medicaid
and enrolled at less than 20 weeks gestation). We will measure change on an index of PRAMM risk factors
directly targeted by the PC-PRAMM (e.g., substance use, treatment-seeking, partner violence, early warning
sign awareness, mental health); total PRAMM among trial participants through 1 year postpartum as measured
using a pre-existing linked dataset of Medicaid claims, deaths, birth records, and primary care program data,
and disparities in both measures. This innovative community-engaged trial will translate key findings from
PRAMM research into a technology-driven intervention with strong potential for cost-effective dissemination. If
supported, this approach could provide a highly scalable approach to PRAMM reduction, particularly among
Black people and in rural areas. Further, the novel open-source platform on which the PC-PRAMM is built would
allow long-term optimization and adaptation based on new findings, quality improvement, and regional needs."
10755687,"ABSTRACT
 Cancer metastases to the leptomeninges (LM) are difficult to treat, create significant morbidity, and
predict extremely poor survival. There are currently no molecularly targeted approaches to prevent LM disease
involvement. LM metastases are frequent in hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL), and the incidence in solid tumors is rising. We recently reported a novel mechanism whereby ALL cells
invade the central nervous system (CNS) LM by migrating along the abluminal surface of emissary blood
vessels that bridge the vertebral and calvarial bone marrow and subarachnoid spaces. ALL cells hijack a
neural stem cell developmental migration pathway involving α6 integrin receptor and laminin binding
interactions in order to crawl along the laminin-rich basement membrane of this unique vasculature. These
vessels pass from the bone marrow through apertures in the vertebral or calvarial bone to directly enter the
LM. Malignant cells expressing the laminin receptor, α6, invade along the external surface of this bridging
vasculature in an integrin-dependent fashion, bypassing the peripheral circulation and the blood brain barrier to
efficiently metastasize to the LM. This finding explains the clinical observation that LM metastases frequently
occur in the absence of brain parenchymal disease involvement. In this proposal, we will define the signaling
events that are activated in leukemic cells upon α6 integrin-laminin engagement, determine the role of α6
integrin-laminin interactions in breast cancer leptomeningeal metastasis, and test the efficacy of downstream
PI3K inhibition to target this pathway in mouse models of ALL and breast cancer LM metastasis. These studies
will provide new mechanistic insight into a poorly understood biologic phenomenon and a therapeutic approach
to an area of high unmet clinical need."
10757428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
“Metabolomics” largely consists of metabolic profiling, which is the process of identification and quantification of
a large number of metabolites of many different biochemical classes, from diverse biological samples, including
cells, culture media, tissue and biofluids. However, to understand the metabolic underpinning of diseases such
as cancer, biochemical mechanism(s) must be elucidated, in which case it is necessary to introduce appropriate
stable isotope tracers. Although this greatly increases the number of analytes to be quantified, it also enables
the retrieval of much more biologically relevant information. This Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM)
approach is a unique specialty of the Metabolism Core, led by PIs with over 40 years of combined expertise in
SIRM. The goals of the Metabolism Core are to provide services for a wide coverage of the metabolome with
isotopomer and isotopologue analysis, and high throughput protein analysis. To achieve this, we make use of
four major analytical platforms, namely (1) high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), (2) ultra-high
resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS), with or without chromatography, (3) ultra-trace
elemental analyses by inductively-coupled plasma MS (ICPMS), and (4) Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA).
The Metabolism Core personnel will advise on analytical methods and SIRM-based experimental design with
development of additional techniques to address specific issues of identification and quantification and biological
interpretation relevant to the COBRE Projects. Because experimental design and sample preparation are integral
to the data acquisition and interpretation, the Metabolism Core provides expertise in these and informatics
relevant to the SIRM approach. These goals will be achieved according to the following Specific Aims. Specific
Aim 1. To provide access and expertise across a wide range of NMR, MS and RPPA technologies to
investigators. Specific Aim 2. To provide experimental design, sample processing, and support to the
investigators for data reduction, metabolic pathway, and biochemical mechanism analyses. Specific Aim
3. To develop and implement new methods to enhance metabolic capabilities relevant to the COBRE
Projects. This Core will support the young investigators by providing advanced analytical technologies and
expertise in the metabolic requirements for cancer development and behavior."

The Imaging Core of the Center for Cancer and Metabolism (CCM) is the technical service and support core
for CCM project research laboratories and pilot project recipients. The integrated services of the Core range
from the imaging capabilities of simple microscopes to imaging analysis by sophisticated and advanced
imaging methodologies. The Imaging Core personnel assist users to operate the instruments and analyze
imaging data. The Core provides advice for the current PIs in this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence
(COBRE) application to use the Imaging Core for their specific studies. The Imaging Core has provided
tremendous help to the projects in Phase I of COBRE support and will continue to make its services readily
available and easily accessible to all COBRE laboratories in order to generate high quality data. Toward the
goals of providing efficient and high-quality imaging services and of establishing a robust imaging infrastructure
within the CCM, we have added new features and new imaging systems to the Core. Our specific aims are: 1)
to provide project-specific training and consultation for COBRE investigators; 2) to develop and adapt state-of-
the art imaging techniques to enhance the research of early-stage and pilot project investigators; and 3) to
develop and implement new methods, to enhance CCM imaging services and make such services available to
COBRE and non-COBRE users. This Core will provide an easily accessible facility where investigators can
evaluate their tissue and/or cellular samples using various types of imaging systems. Dr. Jianhang Jia, the
Director of the Imaging Core, is a highly productive investigator who has successfully obtained substantial
extramural research support including an NIGMS Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) (R35)
award for established investigators that relies extensively on sophisticated imaging capabilities. He has worked
closely with all graduated COBRE PIs, making significant contributions to their successes in obtaining
independent research support. Dr. Jia has guided the development of the four CCM research projects in this
Phase II application, and he will continue to advise CCM investigators on the design of experiments that use
imaging modalities."
10757434,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in men. The mainstay treatment for metastatic PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the disease will inevitably return in an incurable form termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Importantly, aberrant androgen receptor (AR) activation in the milieu of low androgen is the main driver of CRPC. Molecular characterization of CRPC paves the way for discovery of novel therapeutic targets, and my previous studies showed that TRIM28 is aberrantly upregulated in advanced PCa. High TRIM28 levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes, which suggests that TRIM28 could serve as a promising target for PCa therapy. It is known that TRIM28 in a complex with trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3)-specific methyltransferase (SETDB1) possesses transcriptional co-repressor activity but its genomic targets remain largely unexplored in PCa. Moreover, the TRIM28 downstream oncogenic pathway has not been comprehensively investigated in PCa. By molecular gene signature analysis, I found that the steroid hormone metabolic pathway is regulated by TRIM28. In particular, I found that the androgen eliminating enzymes UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 are the key TRIM28-repressed genes. It is known that genomic targeting of the TRIM28 complex is facilitated by transcription factors that bind to specific DNA recognition motifs. My data revealed that TRIM28 interacts with AR. In addition, my preliminary results indicated there is co-occupancy of TRIM28, AR and H3K9me3 deposition at UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 gene loci. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that TRIM28 acts together with AR to epigenetically silence the expression of androgen metabolic enzymes through SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3. I propose to test this hypothesis in Aim1. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 are known to inactivate androgen through glucuronidation using UDPGlucA as the sugar-donor. Given that the overexpression of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 correlate to more UDP-GlucA consumption, I hypothesize that levels of UDP-GlucA will decrease in TRIM28 knockdown cells or with treatment of the SETDB1 inhibitor, Mit, in CRPC cells. I propose to test this hypothesis in Aim2. The results from this proposal will not only reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism for regulating androgen glucuronidation, but also have significant implications for the development of SETDB1-targeted therapy for CRPC treatment."
10757437,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. MYCN-amplification is present in ~25% of NBs and nearly half of all high-risk NBs. N-MYC is a proto-oncogene that drives cancer cell growth, angiogenesis, and metabolism. Aberrant glutamine metabolism is a hallmark of MYC-driven cancers. N-MYC enhances expression of the glutamine transporter, ASCT2. ASCT2 has been shown to be critical for MYCN-amplified NB cell survival in vitro and in subcutaneous xenograft formation in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant glutamine uptake via ASCT2 is critical for MYCN-amplified NB primary tumor growth and metastasis. We will define the critical role of ASCT2 in NB utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and V-9302, a small molecule ASCT2 inhibitor, in 3-D organoid and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of MYCN-amplified NB. Stable-isotope resolved metabolomics will be used to define aberrant metabolic pathways activated to sustain NB survival in the presence of ASCT2 blockade. We will also seek to define metabolic vulnerabilities uncovered by ASCT2 inhibition utilizing an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 lineage dropout screen to assess for dual synthetic lethality in MYCN-amplified NB cells."
10763517,"The long-term goal of the PI Zhang’s laboratory is to decipher intertwined regulatory layers and
mechanisms that control RNA silencing and processing, and to eventually manipulate the regulatory
components and pathways in biotechnological applications. Here this proposal is to describe how the PI Zhang
will investigate unknown mechanisms and regulations of several newly identified components within two
master regulatory hubs centered on Serrate (SE) and Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3 (SGS3) for RNA
silencing in Arabidopsis. RNA silencing clears endogenous and invasive transcripts, and this process is
directed by microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in eukaryotes. MicroRNAs are
produced from hairpin-structured primary miRNA substrates (pri-miRNAs) by microprocessor that comprises of
Dicer-like protein 1 (DCL1), dsRNA binding protein 1 (DRB1), and SE. By contrast, siRNA production entails
the initial conversion of single-stranded (ss) RNA to double-stranded (ds) RNA via a complex composed of
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) and SGS3 before its entry into DCL4/DRB4 complex. Since levels
of miRNAs and siRNAs are critical for their proper functionality in biology, the processing and accumulation of
small RNAs need to be tightly controlled. In research area 1, the PI Zhang will study how the components in
the SE-centered hub regulate miRNA production. Briefly, the PI Zhang laboratory has recently discovered that
RNA secondary structure (RSS) of pri-miRNAs can be remodeled to regulate DCL1/HYL1 activity. Importantly,
several RNA helicases (RHs) have been newly recovered from the hub, but how they sensor and re-wire RSS
of pri-miRNAs to control miRNA production is unknown. Furthermore, extensive preliminary data also identify
key connections between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and microprocessor components that modulate
miRNA production. Thus, the PI Zhang will systematically investigate the novel functions and mechanisms of
the RHs and catalases from SE hub in miRNA biogenesis in Area 1. In research Area 2, the PI Zhang
focuses on the major gap in the siRNA production that is how ssRNA substrates are specified and loaded onto
SGS3/RDR6 for dsRNA synthesis. Through a newly developed genetic screening, numerous novel
components exemplified by U1-70K and BICE1 among others have been recovered to be engaged in siRNA-
mediated RNA silencing. Remarkably, the components interact with RNA polymerases in nucleus and
ribosomes in cytoplasm as well as the shared SGS3 protein. In this setting, the PI Zhang would
comprehensively study how these factors help SGS3 to fetch the nascent transcripts from chromatin, and to
set up the platform for SGS3/RDR6 nearby ribosomes to synthesize dsRNAs. The proposed study will not only
reveal new regulatory layers and mechanisms of RNA silencing, but also enable us to explore the highly
conserved components to control small RNA production and activities in biological processes, and to
eventually to cure physiological disorders that arise from dysfunctions of RNA processing in biotechnology."
10783676,"Project Summary/Abstract
Fibroblasts are key aggressors in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they mediate cartilage and bone destruction,
yet treatments that directly target these cells are lacking. Recent studies from our group and others have
shown that the expansion of an inflammatory subset of fibroblasts are critical to perpetuating the chronic
inflammation in RA, but mechanisms responsible for their inflammatory potentiation are not well-defined. Our
preliminary studies have revealed that synovial fibroblasts are uniquely poised to signal through the Wnt
pathway and further demonstrate that Wnt induces a strong inflammatory response in these cells. Notably,
there is a striking transcriptional gradient demarcated by a Wnt enhancer, R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), and a
putative Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3), that correlates with Wnt pathway enrichment. We find
that synovial fibroblasts derived from active RA patients show enrichment of gene signatures associated with
Wnt activation and Rspo3 expression, suggesting relevance to arthritis manifestation. We hypothesize that Wnt
signaling through this gradient is critical for mediating inflammatory fibroblast pathogenicity and that Wnt
inhibition can ameliorate joint damage in RA. We develop our hypothesis in three independent aims. In Aim 1,
we define the role of Rspo3 and Dkk3 in regulating Wnt-induced synovial fibroblast activation in vitro using
ligand stimulation and knockdown techniques. In Aim 2, we assess Rspo3 and Dkk3 regulation of Wnt
signaling in synovial fibroblasts of distinct RA patient clinical and histologic phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3, we
evaluate the clinical utility of targeting stromal Wnt signaling therapeutically in mouse models of inflammatory
arthritis. We anticipate that the significance of these studies will be to elucidate a molecular mechanism
contributing to fibroblast pathogenicity in RA and to address the unmet need for fibroblast-specific therapeutics.
These studies will provide training in immunology, bioinformatics, and murine models of inflammatory arthritis
that that will build a foundation for the PI to develop an independent lab studying the role of stromal cells in
autoimmune disease."
10777343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Smart devices (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches) and other wearables are increasingly used to deliver
personalized, digital interventions to patients in real time to assist with management of chronic diseases.
Digital interventions provide accessible, low-cost intervention delivery in unlimited amount and duration
whenever and wherever needed, even for reticent or difficult-to-reach populations. Mobile health
systems are excellent tools for the delivery of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), a general
intervention design that aims to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting
to an individual’s changing context. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical
evidence. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are an increasingly common experimental design that are the
main source for data-driven evidence of JITAI effectiveness. Causal moderation analysis is the cornerstone
data analytic method for building effective JITAIs, allowing investigators to answer scientific questions
about when and how to deliver digital interventions.
Current data analytic methods for moderation analysis of MRT data require investigators to pre-specify
features of the intensively collected longitudinal data (ILD) and high frequency sensor and mobile data
(SMD) that are used in a linear model for outcome prediction. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are
better suited to generate these outcome predictions but their use to estimate causal effects can lead to
bias under model misspecification and do not allow for proper uncertainty quantification of treatment
effect estimates. Moreover, current methods are designed to handle data coming from a single MRT;
however, it is increasingly common for researchers to employ designs in which only a subset of study
participants are included in the MRT or to have access to summary-statistics from external mHealth
studies. Combining information from participants in other study arms or external studies with information
from a smaller but more detailed MRT may significantly improve health scientists’ ability to answer
important scientific questions about how intervention effectiveness may change over time or may be
moderated by individual characteristics, time-varying context, or past responses. We propose to combine
ML algorithms and data integration techniques with the standard statistical tools used to assess causal
effect moderation to improve tailoring strategies for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. At its
conclusion, the proposal will provide comprehensive statistical tools for efficient inference of time-varying
causal effects. These methods are essential for building effective intervention packages to improve health
outcomes in populations managing chronic diseases."
10782515,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major public health problem with devastating perioperative outcomes,
affecting as many as 1 in 20 patients undergoing instrumented spine surgery. Procedures such as spinal fusion
comprise the largest overall category of US spending on surgical care and are frequently performed for
patients with pain or disability arising from a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions, such as congenital or
degenerative disease, trauma, and neoplastic disorders. However, SSI rates in instrumented spine surgery are
among the highest of any procedure involving a clean skin incision and they have not substantially decreased
in decades. The development of more effective strategies for SSI prevention in spine surgery is significantly
limited by a lack of fundamental understanding about the origins of causative bacteria, the basic pathogenesis
of spinal wound infection, the microbiome of the back, and the role of antimicrobial resistance to surgical
prophylaxis. We recently demonstrated that the microbiologic causes of spine SSI may vary by operative level
and patient sex, and that most infections are resistant to the surgical antibiotic prophylaxis administered.
 The objectives of this K23 proposal are to build upon this foundation through training in translational
microbiome sciences and by prospectively characterizing the role of the patient microbiome in spine SSI. The
central hypothesis is that most spine SSIs arise from strains colonizing the patient prior to surgery (rather
than acquired in the hospital environment) and that clinically actionable features of the preoperative patient
microbiome strongly influence individual, modifiable risk. The long-term objective of this work is to use novel
bacterial genomic techniques and large clinical datasets to identify the fundamental mechanisms by which
spinal wound infection occurs, enabling the development of more effective prevention strategies. The specific
aims of this proposal are to: 1) define preoperative bacterial genetic features of Staphylococcus aureus
associated with spine SSI, allowing development of improved screening and decolonization measures, 2)
identify sources of endogenous gram-negative spine SSI and associated resistance to surgical antibiotic
prophylaxis, enabling prevention strategies for this important class of infection that may disproportionately
affect specific groups (e.g., women undergoing lumbosacral procedures), and 3) determine clinical risk factors
for resistance to surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery to inform tailored approaches to selection of
antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery for diverse patient populations.
 These research activities are closely aligned with my career development plans. Through the team of
expert mentors assembled from anesthesiology, surgery, and molecular microbiology, I will receive training in
cutting-edge translational microbiome research and career development toward independence. This award will
prepare me for my first R01 submission on tailored SSI prevention tools/strategies for clinical use in spine
surgery and for an independent translational research career in perioperative infection prevention."

10757406,"Epilepsy is a common neurological that will affect 1 in 26 Americans during their lifetime. Mutations in SCN1A,
encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1, are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy.
Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity, ranging from
mild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome, a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused by
heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure types,
developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable
expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation, suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic
modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndrome
phenotypes, including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced
sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitory
imbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/-
mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast,
Scn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality, with
50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes.
GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current density
compared to wildtype littermates, while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from
129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the
loss of Nav1.1, while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at the
whole animal and cellular levels, we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity
due to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygous
deletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality of
Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal, we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First, we will perform fine
mapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second, we will perform
single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cell
subpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant
129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third, we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptional
modulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifier
genes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes that
influence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggest
novel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients."
10757393,"Project Summary/Abstract
Checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy treatment, but many tumors remain
unresponsive due to lack of effector T cell infiltration and activation in the tumor microenvironment. Innate
immune priming of these “cold” tumors has emerged as a therapeutic strategy for increasing the efficacy of
checkpoint blockade through stimulated type I interferon (IFN) production and downstream adaptive response.
Recent efforts and ongoing clinical trials have focused on activation of the STING-dependent antiviral pathway
to promote IFN production in the tumor microenvironment. However, many tumors downregulate STING
signaling, and the therapeutic effects of STING agonists are thought to be mediated by their effects on tumor-
infiltrating host myeloid cells.
 Our lab recently discovered that the DNA damage sensor DNA-PK triggers a STING-independent DNA
sensing pathway (SIDSP) in human cells that potently activates IFN production in response to foreign DNA.
We have developed synthetic superagonists of DNA-PK-dependent antiviral immunity that trigger potent
antiviral responses in human melanoma cells that are unresponsive to STING agonists. We hypothesize that
activation of the SIDSP within tumor cells will provide a unique signal to enhance inflammation within tumors
and will stimulate potent immune responses.
 The goal of this proposal is to assess DNA-PK-SIDSP activation as a therapeutic strategy in human
cancer. We will determine how DNA-PK directs distinct outcomes to DNA damage versus foreign DNA, and we
will evaluate the therapeutic potential of triggering the DNA-PK-SIDSP in human tumors, in vitro and in vivo
using cutting edge humanized mouse models. Our studies will uncover fundamental new aspects of the biology
of the SIDSP, together with the first pre-clinical evaluation of DNA-PK activation as a novel cancer
immunotherapy."
10872174,"Extracellular adenosine (ADO) is a potent immunoregulatory nucleoside that limits tissue damage due to
inflammation. ADO is produced by the action of cell surface ectoenzymes (CD39/CD73) that metabolize
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) and then into ADO. Our NHP studies showed that, upon SIV infection, the levels of ADO in the gut tissues
are lower in models of pathogenic infection (pigtailed macaques, PTMs; which develops severe gut dysfunction
and systemic INFL upon the SIV infection) than in models of nonpathogenic infection (African green monkeys,
AGMs; which maintain an intact gut barrier and baseline levels of IA/INFL upon SIV infection). The different
CD39/CD73 expression on mucosal Tregs and contrasting ADO levels in these species with divergent
inflammatory responses to SIV support a key role of ADO in controlling IA/INFL in nonpathogenic SIV infections.
Changes in ADO levels predominately occurred in the gut, suggesting that the ADO pathway may be involved
in sparing the AGMs from developing SIV-related gut dysfunction. These findings strongly support a significant
involvement of the ADO pathway in the pathogenesis of SIV/HIV related gut dysfunction and indicate that more
focused studies aimed to harness the ADO pathway at mucosal sites of viral replication are needed. In this
project, we will directly test the hypothesis that the ADO signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in modulating the
inflammatory gut mucosal environment after SIV/HIV infection, through an intervention aimed at increasing ADO
production in a model of pathogenic SIV infection. We will administer the HIF-1α prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor
Roxadustat to chronically SIV-infected NHPs and assess its impact on the gut integrity and on key parameters
of SIV pathogenesis. Our objectives are to assess the impact of increasing ADO signaling on (i) alleviating gut
dysfunction and systemic INFL and (ii) virus reservoirs. These innovative experiments will directly probe a new
regulatory inflammatory pathway, enabling us to decipher the mechanisms responsible for the HIV/SIV-related
gut dysfunction. As such, our studies will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at preservation of gut integrity
and control of residual IA/INFL that are the root causes of multiple comorbidities. Finally, if successful, our
experiments may be directly translated as a new therapeutic strategy to alleviate SIV/HIV-related gut dysfunction."

define the natural history of KAND based on a rapidly increasing patient database and correlate clinical
severity and rate of progression with KIF1A genotype. Aim 2 will be to use advanced single molecule
biophysical and in vivo axonal transport approaches to determine the molecular and cellular consequences of

They will provide extensive new information on the progression of the disease and the relationship of mutation
site to prognosis. And, they will take advantage of our new molecular and physiological insights into gene

 Otitis media (OM) is a spectrum of clinical entities that presents a tremendous global health burden; in fact,
OM is the most common infectious bacterial disease in children. Sequelae of OM include hearing impairment,
developmental and language delays, and even death, with nearly $5B spent annually in the US alone for
medical/surgical management and lost wages for working parents. The primary causative agents of OM are
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and Moraxella catarrhalis
(Mcat). Spn was once the leading cause of acute OM (AOM); however, the introduction of pneumococcal
conjugate vaccines (PVCs) has significantly reduced Spn-associated AOM, thereby paving the way for NTHI
and non-vaccine Spn serotypes to dominate. Vaccination remains the most impactful and cost-effective way to
prevent OM, yet the ever-changing bacteriology of OM requires non-traditional approaches to resolve, and
ideally prevent, this global pediatric disease. Clarametyx Biosciences has developed the CMTX-301 vaccine
candidate to address all-pathogen OM. Immunization with CMTX-301 focuses the host immune response on
specific protective epitopes within components of the bacterial biofilm responsible for its structural stability.
When exposed to these antibodies, biofilms rapidly collapse with release of biofilm-resident bacteria. Given
that biofilms are the greatest defense mechanism against disease resolution, collapse of these protective
fortresses has proven to augment disease resolution in multiple diverse models of experimental disease,
including models of OM. By rapidly collapsing bacterial biofilms, vaccination with CMTX-301 allows the host’s
natural immune response to clear infection in a pathogen-agnostic manner. Data to date have demonstrated
the ability of CMTX-301 to induce collapse of biofilms formed by over 22 bacterial species (both Gram-negative
and -positive), including the high priority ESKAPEE pathogens and all three predominant otopathogens.
Preliminary evaluation of CMTX-301 has demonstrated its ability to prevent disease in a chinchilla viral-
bacterial superinfection model of ascending NTHI-induced OM. The program proposed herein will support
studies needed to optimize the research and development precursor of CMTX-301 into a clinically-viable
vaccine candidate. We have included studies designed to first evaluate formulations of CMTX-301 with FDA
approved adjuvants. Then, based on multiple characteristics and strengths of the induced immune response,
the lead and a backup formulation will be tested for relative protective efficacy in a chinchilla model of
experimental NTHI-induced OM model with expanded confirmatory evaluation in a rat model of Spn-induced
OM. We include evaluation of dose regimen and schedule as part of our program. Additionally, the lead
candidate will undergo safety evaluation and GMP manufacturing, as needed to support an Investigational
New Drug application with the FDA. This project will position CMTX-301 for advanced development to clinical
trials and subsequent commercialization for pediatric use."
10762347,"Project Summary
Ambient air pollution is a global environmental threat, contributing to millions of deaths and hundreds of
millions of disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) annually. However, the major limitation of air pollution health
studies remains exposure assessment. Although there have been great advances in air pollution assessment
and several sophisticated spatio-temporal models have been developed to predict daily air pollution levels at
the residential addresses of study participants, the performance of these models varies in space and time.
Even the best on average performing prediction model, however, will have limited predictive ability in certain
space and time points. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with use of a single prediction model has been
consistently ignored in health studies, which could lead to invalid inferences of the health effect estimates, and
inconsistent findings across studies. We propose to address this critical gap by developing a novel ensemble
model framework for exposure assessment in air pollution health studies, integrating information across
multiple existing prediction models. With this approach, we will for the first time be able to comprehensively
quantify any inter- and intra-model uncertainty associated with ambient air pollution exposures. We will develop
ensemble methods both for single- and multi-pollutant settings. We propose to apply the developed methods
and fully propagate exposure uncertainty in health effect estimation using two nationwide open cohorts, mainly
Medicare and Medicaid, as well as an open cohort of hospital admissions in New York State (Statewide
Planning and Research Cooperative System, SPARCS). These datasets provide information on approximately
all elderly, low-income and disabled Americans across the United States (Medicare and Medicaid,
respectively), with residential information the zip-code level, as well as 98% of all hospitalizations in NY State,
with information available at the residential address. Specifically we will assess the long- and short-term impact
of air pollution exposure on mortality (Medicare and Medicaid), and cardiorespiratory morbidity (all three
cohorts).We communicate the air pollution predictions, the spatio-temporal uncertainty of air pollution exposure
assessment and related health effect estimates to the public and regulatory agencies. The proposed novel
paradigm to assess air pollution exposures in health studies will greatly improve communication of exposure
uncertainty in the health effect estimates both to policy makers and the public, exactly responding to one of
NIH's priority research areas. Our tools can be easily extended and will benefit integration of information and
uncertainty characterization at different locations and at a global scale, as well as for other environmental
exposures."

engagement of faculty and ESIs with resources to support collaborations, grant preparations, publications, and
networking. (2) Identify and foster the growth of diverse trainees for a career in cancer research and health
disparities. We will support the recruitment and development of trainees from diverse backgrounds across the
career continuum with an emphasis on H/L. (3) Support novel research projects that will contribute to the
identification and elimination of cancer health disparities in H/L. We will foster the development of projects
that investigate the biological basis, psychological and social factors of cancer disparities through a rigorous
evaluation of research projects that have the potential to reduce specific disparity gaps. (4) Increase community
engagement in cancer health disparities research. This will be accomplished by fostering community
engagement, including bi-directional activities, education, increased social media presence, and dialogue with
the research component and activities of our Community Health Educator."
10929482,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – TALENT SHARED RESOURCES CORE
The TALENT (Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT for Equity) Shared Resource within the Cancer Research
and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership will provide a coordinated array of resources
that will support the scientific and professional development of early-stage investigators (ESIs). TALENT will
contribute to systemic change by focusing on the experiences of faculty poised to diversify leadership within
the cancer research community. TALENT uses an approach that optimizes the positive affect and intrinsic
motivation for faculty to thrive in their careers, contextualizing leadership positions as both attractive and
attainable. While the Shared Resource will use traditional faculty development models as a starting point, its
novelty comes from the primary focus of maintaining an environment that allows faculty innate excellence to
emerge. Using evidence-based strategies, TALENT will 1) reduce perceptions of isolation and promotion-
based stress that affect excellence, impact, and productivity; 2) adapt multi-mentor approaches to amplify
active sponsorship activities; 3) reduce administrative and non-research-related burdens by providing timely,
thoughtful services and resources to accelerate scholarly success; and 4) interrogate institutional policies and
practices that may obstruct faculty productivity. TALENT will support ESIs, including PhD and MD faculty from
racial or ethnic backgrounds considered underrepresented in health-related sciences who focus on cancer
research. Additionally, TALENT will support ESI faculty of any racial or ethnic background who have a primary
academic focus on cancer health disparities research. The Shared Resource includes the following Specific
Aims: 1) Reduce feelings of isolation and advancement-related stress for TALENT ESI faculty to enable
success in developing competitive extramural research grants focused on cancer and cancer disparities; 2)
Provide targeted resources to eliminate barriers to research proposal development and scholarly success; and
3) Collectively interrogate and advocate for change within existing institutional structures to optimize the
institutional environment for TALENT ESI success. The Shared Resource stands to impact CREATE ESI
faculty, and it will be integrated with other components of the Partnership. CREATE undergraduate, medical,
and graduate students supported through the Research Education Core will have the opportunity to work under
the mentorship of TALENT ESIs, who are ideally positioned to provide near-peer mentorship to these younger
trainees. TALENT ESIs will be able to take part in a Field Experience in Cancer Health Disparities through the
Outreach Core. Finally, the Outreach Core will collaborate with TALENT to assist ESIs focused on conducting
community-engaged research with underserved communities. Overall, the multifaceted support provided by
TALENT will help guide ESI faculty towards successful academic careers, placing them in optimal positions to
become future leaders in cancer research."

The first step of vision takes place in the retina where light is captured by the outer segment organelle of
rod and cone photoreceptors. The outer segment is a modified primary cilium that contains a stack of flat
disc-shaped membranes. This structural arrangement maximizes light detection by forcing photons to
pass through hundreds of membrane layers densely packed with the light absorbing protein, opsin. A
byproduct of light absorption is photooxidative damage, which the photoreceptor overcomes by
continuously replacing its entire membrane-rich outer segment with new protein and lipid material.
Defects in outer segment trafficking, formation, and function ultimately result in photoreceptor cell loss
and cause a broad spectrum of inherited retinal dystrophies including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod
dystrophy and Stargardt disease. It is now well established that photoreceptors utilize multiple trafficking
pathways to deliver structural and signaling proteins to the light-sensitive outer segment organelle;
however, how these pathways are coordinated, the molecular processes regulating delivery, why a cargo
chooses a specific route remains largely unknown. The goals of our proposal are to investigate the
trafficking pathways of outer segment membrane cargos that reside within the discs (rhodopsin), the disc
rims (peripherin-2 and ABCA4) and the plasma membrane surrounding the discs (CNG channel). This
comprehensive approach will allow us to understand shared and divergent features between specific
trafficking pathways as well as build a complete overview of intracellular routes to the outer segment. Our
aims utilize proximity labeling approaches to uncover transport partners in vivo as well as gene delivery
techniques to rapidly screen candidates for targeting defects and uncover signals governing conventional
and unconventional delivery to the outer segment in mouse rods. Completion of our aims will provide
insight into how outer segment trafficking pathways cooperate to deliver the structural and functional
proteins necessary to form the light-sensing outer segment organelle as well as how these processes fail
during disease. Looking forward, our proposal aims to provide fundamental knowledge about membrane
trafficking to sensory cilia in general as well as help to inform future therapeutic strategies for patients
suffering from inherited blindness."
10763421,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cells of the innate immune system such as monocytes and macrophages can be reprogrammed by their
environmental context. Stimuli in the environment, such as cytokines and pathogen-associated molecules, can
dramatically alter cellular phenotype. This phenomenon, termed “trained immunity,” is driven by epigenetic
changes to the enhancer repertoire. Upon stimulation, transcription factors such as NFκB can bind to closed
chromatin regions, open the chromatin, and facilitate histone modification, activating previously silent regulatory
DNA elements called latent enhancers. These epigenetically reprogrammed innate immune cells respond
differently to subsequent stimulation and alter host responses to infectious diseases.
Interestingly, the effects of trained immunity are variable. In some cases, trained immunity primes the host to
produce an increased inflammatory response upon secondary stimulation, but in other cases it diminishes the
inflammatory response. Whether reprogrammed monocytes produce increased or diminished inflammatory
responses depends on what stimulus forms the memory. That is, the effects of trained immunity are stimulus-
specific. However, the mechanisms that account for this stimulus-specificity are unclear, and understanding
these mechanisms will be critical for harnessing the therapeutic potential of trained immunity.
The central hypothesis of this grant is that different dynamic features of NFκB activity contribute to the stimulus-
specificity of trained immunity. NFκB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is considered the master regulator
of inflammatory gene expression. Although nearly all pathogens and cytokines activate NFκB, they do so with
varying dynamics. In particular, some stimuli induce an oscillatory pattern of activity, while others induce a non-
oscillatory pattern of activity. We have shown that non-oscillatory NFκB results in more de novo enhancers than
oscillatory NFκB using a mouse model in which NFκB oscillations are perturbed. Aim 1 of this proposal
characterizes the stimulus-specificity of training in vivo and tests the hypothesis that trained immunity produced
by different NFκB dynamics differentially alters host response to secondary infection with Candida albicans. Aim
2 investigates the mechanisms by which NFκB dynamics-dependent enhancers regulate gene expression.
This mentored career development award will support the training of a promising junior faculty member at UCLA.
The specific training objectives are to acquire expertise in 1) bioinformatics, 2) mouse models of infection, 3)
immune profiling of tissue samples, and 4) the field of innate immune memory. Training will occur through
mentorship by senior faculty members, coursework, seminars, and international conferences. The goal of this
career development award is to establish the principal investigator as an independent physician-scientist,
ultimately producing diagnostic and therapeutic tools for immune-mediated complications of infectious diseases."
10915022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are highly prevalent among adolescents and young adults in
sub-Saharan Africa, who are also at the highest risk of acquiring HIV. Untreated STIs, such as gonorrhea,
chlamydia, and trichomoniasis, increase HIV acquisition and transmission risks and can lead to significant
morbidity for women, including pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, and pregnancy complications.
Faced by constraints in diagnostic capacity, many countries rely on syndromic management, which has poor
sensitivity and specificity, particularly because the majority of curable STIs are asymptomatic. As accurate
diagnostic tests for STIs are developed, effective screening strategies to reach populations at high risk for STIs
and HIV, such as adolescents and young adults in rural South Africa, need to be rigorously evaluated to inform
the future implementation of STI screening programs. I am an Infectious Disease physician with a background
in clinical epidemiology and an interest in decreasing the burden of STIs and their contribution to HIV
transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. I am motivated to pursue training to apply new methods to the design and
evaluation of STI screening strategies in rural South Africa. The NIH K23 Mentored Research Career
Development Award will afford me the opportunity to gain the necessary skills to become an independent
clinician investigator. I will pursue training in (1) qualitative research methods, (2) discrete choice analysis and
clinical trial design, and (3) implementation science methods and frameworks. I have designed a didactic
curriculum to address each of these training aims and assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team. My
primary mentor is Dr. Ingrid Bassett, an expert in cohort studies and implementation research to evaluate HIV
and tuberculosis linkage to care in South Africa. My mentorship team additionally includes experts in
community-based, peer-led interventions for sexual health and HIV prevention in South Africa (Dr. Maryam
Shahmanesh), qualitative research (Dr. Christina Psaros), and biostatistics (Dr. Robert Parker). With their
guidance, I will assess young people’s preferences for STI screening and design and evaluate a community-
based STI screening strategy in rural South Africa through the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate motivation
and preferences for STI screening among adolescents and young adults using qualitative methods, 2) Conduct
a Discrete Choice Experiment to quantify young people’s preferences for community-based STI screening, and
3) Evaluate the implementation of a new community-based STI screening strategy among adolescents and
young adults. I will deepen an existing collaboration with the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI),
leveraging the infrastructure of a funded clinical trial. The proposed training and research aims will inform
future efforts to expand STI screening in South Africa, and will provide a strong foundation for my career as an
independent clinician investigator focused at the intersection of STIs and HIV prevention."
10768815,"As DNA sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, utilization of whole exome sequencing (ES) and whole
genome sequencing (GS) as a diagnostic tool has become widespread. It is essential that physicians understand
when these tests should be ordered, how to interpret and use the test results including variants of uncertain
significance and secondary findings, and understand the ethical, legal and social issues generated by these
results. Recent surveys of medical students at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM) revealed
a desire to learn more about genetic testing and its broad application to clinical medicine. To this end, we
developed the Genomic Medicine Translational Science course (Genomic Medicine TS course) for the 3rd and
4th year JHUSOM medical students. This active learning course consists of three 5-hour days during
intersession of the academic years with the objectives of improving the medical students’ understanding of ES
and GS. From 2017 to 2022, 296 students took the Genomic Medicine elective. To achieve the course objectives,
we developed (and made freely available) the PhenoDB Teaching Tool with accompanying phenotypic and ES
data to be analyzed as proband only, in a family setting or cohorts of patients with a particular phenotype. Since
2015, we have used the Genomic Medicine TS course curriculum, tools and resources to teach in the annual
McKusick Short Course offered collaboratively by the Jackson Laboratory and JHUSOM. In 2021, with the
Brazilian Society of Medical Genetics, we used these materials to teach >350 participants from South America
and Europe. In 2022, we guided the faculty at UNIFESP on implementing the Genomic Medicine course
curriculum to teach 36 medical and graduate students and postdocs in that Institution.
 A much more in-depth Genomic Medicine education, as provided by a M.S. degree, would prepare the
trainees for careers analyzing the human genome in academic research centers, government, and industry,
including biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical companies, and clinical laboratories. It would also help clinical
guideline developers provide evidence-based genetic/genomic interpretation to properly use genomic
information for patient health care decision-making. Thus, there is a great need for master’s education programs
that provide health professional and related trainees with the knowledge and skills required to manipulate,
annotate, and interpret human genome data, and a foundation for pursuing genomics research. To address this
need, we will leverage our evolving expertise in analysis of genomic data and education (Nara Sobreira, Joann
Bodurtha, David Valle, Weiyi Mu, Nancy Hueppchen, Kim Doheny, Winston Timp, Xiao Peng, Jim Stevenson,
Dane Witmer, Carolyn Applegate) and the unique tools and resources available at JHUSOM such as the ones
offered by the Office of Online Education (Robert Kearns), by the Johns Hopkins Advanced Academic Programs
(Robert Lessick), and PhenoDB Teaching Tool to develop a Genomic Medicine M.S. program that will address
the expanding need for genomic literacy and create opportunities for these individuals to train others."

proposal, named “Improving Primary Care Understanding of Resources and Screening for Urinary
Incontinence to Enhance Treatment (PURSUIT)” as part of the Improving Nonsurgical Treatment of Urinary
Incontinence among women in Primary Care (INTUIT-PC). Our overarching goal is to improve access to
evidence-based nonsurgical UI treatment for women Veterans using the most effective remote delivery
modality in the Southeast region of the U.S. In our first aim, we will compare two models: our mHealth UI
modality alone and our mHealth UI model combined with clinician expertise delivered via clinical video
telehealth (CVT) to improve UI symptoms at the patient level. With leverage from our current clinical trial
infrastructure that utilizes these two models, our proposed study will incorporate a sequential, multiple
assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to determine the optimal model for remote delivery of
nonsurgical UI treatment for UI symptom improvement. In our second aim, we propose an implementation
strategy of practice facilitation, to improve awareness and adherence to evidence-based guidelines on
nonsurgical UI treatments at the practice level. We will employ a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation
design to assess the effectiveness of our mHealth intervention, while using the Reach, Efficacy/effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our practice level implementation
approach. For our third mixed-methodology aim, we seek to explore women Veterans’ and providers’
perceptions of key factors that may influence future remote UI treatment scalability for local, regional, and
national dissemination. PURSUIT aims to target 62 primary care practices that treat over 50,000 women
Veterans. Practices will be randomized in clusters to receive the interactive mHealth UI application non-
surgical UI treatment modality with or without additional clinical UI expertise delivered via telehealth. All
primary care practices will receive practice facilitation with a PURSUIT toolkit that includes (1) 1-2 visits with a
practice facilitator engaging practices through virtual group sessions and one on-site visit (if allowed); (2)
Mobile-health or mHealth Application Training (MAT) training: MAT training will be offered through in-person
academic detailing, online resources, and ongoing support via email or office hours with project staff and
experts; 3) Online Resource Hub: The online resource hub will be available throughout project implementation,
and e-learning modules will serve as the structural base for virtual practice facilitation sessions; and (4) Health
information technology (HIT) assistance: Project staff will offer support in developing UI registries for
population management, quality improvement, and data reporting through the mHealth nonsurgical UI
application. Our future goal is to disseminate the most effective modality for delivering nonsurgical UI treatment
for women Veterans nationally within the Veterans Healthcare Administration."

A plethora of research exists highlighting the disproportionate disparities faced by sexual and gender
minorities (SGM) of all ages, such as increased levels of homelessness, lack of access to healthcare, and
negative physical and psychological outcomes. While there have been significant efforts to address
systemic racism and social determinants of health (SDOHs) at the community level throughout the US
(such as improving access to safe, affordable housing, improved healthcare, etc.), these efforts tend to
neglect to properly integrate the experiences of SGM. There is also a severe lack of data, particularly
across that lifespan, that examines the intersectionality of sexual orientation, gender identity, and health.
This project addresses how the SDOHs impact structural inequities across the intergenerational SGM
community of Miami-Dade County, FL, and will provide place-based structural interventions and
development of a shared data system to improve health outcomes. Using the NIH Sexual & Gender
Minority Health Disparities Research Framework as a foundation, place-based structural interventions
will be co-designed with the target population and local Health Equity Research Assembly; longitudinal
data will be collected using a mixed-methods approach; and a sustainable shared data system will be
developed, including a data dashboard that includes SGM demographic indicators across all indicators
and improvement to existing data collection tools.
This project aims to produce positive health outcomes across the lifespan and improvements on social
determinants of health impacting MDC's SGM population and a sustainable, replicable model
generalizable not only to SGM populations in other geographic locations, but to other vulnerable
populations."
10776357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by intense cortical activation, giving rise to its wake-like
electroencephalogram (EEG). Disturbances in REM sleep are symptomatic of mood disorders including major
depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, to
what extent altered cortical activity in mood disorders may directly cause changes in REM sleep remains largely
unknown. Particularly, because REM sleep is thought to be primarily controlled by subcortical nuclei, the
mechanisms by which the PFC may regulate REM sleep are unknown. A prominent biomarker for depression is
an increase in phasic REM sleep, reflected in an increased density (frequency) of rapid eye movements during
REM sleep. However, despite its clinical relevance, the mechanisms and brain structures underlying the
regulation of phasic REM sleep are still largely unknown.
Our preliminary results show that pyramidal neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) promote REM sleep in mice
through their projections to the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In addition, we found that activation of mPFC
pyramidal neurons enhances the density of rapid eye movements during REM sleep. The central objective of
this proposal is to identify the neural mechanisms by which the mPFC regulates the induction and maintenance
of REM sleep and rapid eye movement density. This will be accomplished in two aims. First, we will combine in
vivo calcium imaging, optogenetics, optrode recordings, and viral tracing to identify the activity, connectivity, and
functional role in brain state regulation of the LH neurons innervated by the mPFC. Second, we will investigate
the mechanisms by which the mPFC regulates rapid eye movements during REM sleep. We will combine
pupillometry with optogenetic manipulation, in vivo calcium, and optrode recordings to examine whether the
axonal projections from the mPFC to the pons induce rapid eye movements and test whether mPFC neurons
and their postsynaptic pontine neurons are recruited during rapid eye movements. Unraveling the mechanisms
by which the mPFC controls REM sleep and the rapid eye movement density is a critical precursor to resolving
the causal relationship between changes in prefrontal circuits associated with depression and REM sleep
disturbances. Our results have the potential to develop more refined biomarkers to infer from disturbances in the
regulation of REM sleep and rapid eye movements information about the integrity of prefrontal circuits in health
and disease."
10776563,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Peripheral nervous system (PNS) injuries impact millions of Americans each year with
approximately 20 million people currently living with the effects of such injury. In the case of
severe injuries, nerve pathways, connections, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding
the nerve that lead to the distal innervation targets are disrupted. If the injury gap is large
enough, functional recovery is extremely limited and adequate clinical therapies don’t exist. A
key reason for poor functional recovery is that neurons lack the proper guidance, alignment, and
signaling from the damaged ECM to allow for targeted growth across injured tissue. Therefore,
our overarching goal is to develop an ultrashock-mediated, bioactive scaffold to address
traumatic PNS injury. The scaffold will possess controllable electrical, physical, and chemical
signaling capabilities to address guidance, alignment, and cell-ECM communication.
Piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene)(PVDF-TrFE) is integrated with
decellularized ECM and capable of producing controllable electrical stimulation in response to
remote ultrashock activation without the need for electrodes due to its piezoelectric capacity.
The studies proposed will focus on quantitatively determining and controlling the electric
potential of the scaffolds due to ultrashock and mechanical stimulation (Aim 1), analysis of the
integration and phenotypic response of Schwann cells to PVDF-TrFE scaffolds (Aim 2), and the
ability of the scaffold to minimize immune response while evaluating the ability to repair critical
sized nerve gaps in vivo (Aim 3)."

Abstract
Few modifiable factors have been identified that improve neurodevelopmental (ND) outcomes. One such factor,
supplemental folic acid (SFA), taken before and during the first weeks post-conception, reduced risk for neural
tube defects (NTDs) by up to 70% in randomized trials, initiating mandatory food grain fortification and guidelines
for SFA intake for people who could or had become pregnant, with subsequent increases in blood folate
concentrations and reduced NTD prevalence. While generally regarded as a public health success, the impacts
have not been evenly distributed across sub-populations within the US, with Hispanic populations at higher risk
for NTDs, more likely to have suboptimal folate status, and less likely to take SFA. Further, the biologic
mechanisms behind this protection remain unclear. Prenatal SFA and adequate folate status has since been
associated with improved behavioral and language outcomes, higher executive functioning, and reduced risk for
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and associated traits. High
folate/SFA has also been shown to attenuate increased risks associated with several contaminant exposures
that are more prevalent in groups that are under-represented in research and/or more likely to have sub-optimal
folate status and less likely to meet SFA intake recommendations. One example includes plasticizers in personal
care products that are more prevalent in Hispanic populations and are linked to increased ND risk which is
attenuated with prenatal SFA. Many gaps in understanding and implementation of SFA measures need to be
addressed to increase the public health impact of SFA interventions to their fullest potential: 1) How does the
timing of SFA initiation and its association with blood folate differ across subpopulations? 2) What other child
health outcomes are associated with prenatal SFA and blood folate? 3) How do these associations differ by the
timing and dose of SFA intake? 4) How do doses and timing of SFA and folate concentrations linked with
improved child outcomes differ across people with different genetic, environmental, and nutritional backgrounds?
5) Does periconceptional SFA/folate status modify associations between environmental contaminants, including
novel chemicals, and ND outcomes including behavioral problems and high autistic traits? 6) What biologic
pathways are modified in utero by periconceptional SFA and suboptimal folate status? 7) How do those biologic
pathways relate to known ND pathways? 8) How does the conceiving partner's preconception folate status relate
to placenta epigenetics and the child's outcomes? Our strong team with relevant expertise in reproductive,
environmental and nutritional epidemiology, interactions, epigenetics and ND assessment, plus ample
experience engaging community partners, will recruit 740 expecting families in Northern California representing
diverse racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, genetic and environmental backgrounds to enrich the ECHO cohort with
participants traditionally underrepresented in research to address these gaps and produce findings that will
substantially inform public health policies for more effective improvement of child developmental outcomes."
10885150,"19F MRI, has shown promising success in clinical trials for monitoring cell therapy, where small groups of
cells, showing poor contrast in 1H-MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), are easily tracked using 19F-MRI.1
Contrast is provided by nanoemulsions of perfluorocarbon (PFC) oils pre-loaded into cells. A major advantage
of 19F-MRI is that lack of natural fluorine in the body allows for very high contrast-to-noise for 19F-MRI
compared to 1H-MRI.2 Use of 19F-MRI in molecular imaging, by targeting specific biomarkers, is of great
interest, but the development of probes for these applications has been an elusive goal. Typical synthetic
methods produce relatively large particles, > 150 nm, which induce nonspecific uptake by phagocytic cells.
While avid nonspecific uptake is advantageous for labeling T cells and other immune cells ex vivo, it is a
decided limitation for imaging of biomarkers as it can create high background signal in the inflamed tissues
characteristic in many diseases. 19F MRI should be an excellent platform for biomarker detection but there is a
critical unmet need for suitable 19F MRI contrast agents that avoid nonspecific immune cell surveillance.
Ideally, contrast agents need to be<100 nm to avoid nonspecific uptake. We propose exploratory studies to
develop innovative new 19F MRI contrast agents based on nanodiscs. Nanodiscs are < 50 nm in size, avoid
liver clearance, and escape immune surveillance. We hypothesize that nanodiscs, which are structurally similar
to high density lipoproteins that carry cholesterol in a hydrophobic core, may be ideal for carrying hydrophobic
perfluorocarbons. Our aims are to explore synthetic parameters in benchtop (Aim 1) and microfluidic (Aim 2)
approaches to optimize loading of perfluorocarbons into nanodiscs. In each aim we will systematically
investigate variables that influence nanodisc size and perfluorocarbon loading. New nanodiscs will be
characterized for physical properties such composition and dimensions, and the top 3 products from each Aim
will be evaluated for lack of toxicity and biodistribution in a mouse model. The leading nanodiscs will be
modified for targeting CD204, a biomarker for tumor associated macrophages, and tested in a mouse breast
cancer model. We are team composed of contrast agent (UCD) and nanodisc (LLNL) experts who are ideally
positioned and well-equipped to carry out the proposed aims. The success of this project would add novel
nanodiscs materials with the potential not only for targeted 19F MR molecular imaging, but for applications in
photoacoustic, and radiotherapy, and tracking drug delivery."
10914651,"Project Summary
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer and despite aggressive treatment strategies that include
medical therapy, surgical resection, and radiation therapy, 5-year survival rates for patients with lung cancer
remain dismal. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several immune checkpoint
inhibitor-based therapies for the treatment of NSCLC, establishing immunotherapy as an effective therapeutic
option and standard-of-care treatment for NSCLC. Despite this, many patients fail to respond to immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) and the subgroup of patients with KRAS and STK11 commutations (KL) has
emerged as a particularly aggressive, immunosuppressive form of NSCLC resistant to ICB. Our group has
recently discovered that by treating KL-mutated NSCLC with epigenetic de-repressing agents, expression of a
key protein in the immune response against lung cancer, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), is restored.
When stimulus for the STING pathway is subsequently provided through pulsed inhibition of a spindle
assembly checkpoint protein, monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1), potent anti-tumor responses occur, restoring
sensitivity to ICB. While these findings have yet to be validated in clinical samples of KL-mutated NSCLC,
these samples are now available to use for study. Validation of this therapeutic strategy will show that it is
possible to overcome KL-mutation induced immunosuppression, though, it does not generate neoantigens to
drive durable anti-neoplastic immune responses. Fortunately, MPS1 shares kinase homology with CDC2-like
kinase (CLK2), a key regulator of mRNA splicing, and dual MPS1/CLK2 inhibitors have been developed. This
provides the unique opportunity to additionally dive durable anti-tumor immune responses through
simultaneous pharmacological disruption of mRNA splicing. Indeed, pharmacological modulation of splicing
was recently demonstrated as a definitive, untapped method to generate neoantigens that elicit anti-tumor
immune responses. The overall goal of this fellowship proposal is, therefore, to provide advanced post-doctoral
training in translational cancer immunotherapy research while evaluating a novel approach to enhance
immunogenicity in a highly aggressive and resistant form of NSCLC. We will accomplish this by (1) validating
the effect of epigenetic de-repression of STING and pulsed MPS1 inhibition in clinical samples of ICB-resistant,
KL-mutated NSCLC and (2) examining mRNA splice disruption and neoantigen generation in dual MPS1/CLK2
inhibitor treated KL-mutated NSCLC. Together these aims will seek to improve therapeutic outcomes for
patients with NSCLC while enhancing the pool of highly trained physician-scientists."
10931616,"ABSTRACT
In the United States, cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease in those <20 years of age, and
approximately 80% of survivors have at least one chronic health condition by 45 years of age. One of the
strongest risk factors for cancer in children and adolescents is being born with a congenital anomaly—this is
true both for chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome) and non-chromosomal birth defects (e.g., non-
syndromic congenital heart defects), as recently validated in our registry linkage study of over 10 million live
births. By linking data from population-based birth defects and cancer registries in four states included in the
Genetic Overlap Between Anomalies and Cancer in Kids (GOBACK) Study, we identified multiple novel
congenital anomaly-cancer associations that are not part of known cancer predisposition syndromes, including
choanal atresia-acute leukemia (HR=9.2, 95% CI: 3.8-22.1) and CHD-neuroblastoma (HR=3.4, 95%: 2.6-4.5).
Furthermore, consistent with our epidemiologic findings, our genomic assessments have led to the
identification of a novel leukemia predisposition disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies
(including choanal atresia) and pathogenic germline variants in USP9X. In this application, we propose to
expand our integrated epidemiologic and genomic approach to address our central hypothesis that
pleiotropic genetic variation generates specific congenital anomaly-pediatric cancer (CA-PC) patterns
with increased risk conferred to each co-occurring phenotype. Our overall objective is to elucidate the
overlap between congenital anomalies and pediatric cancer by leveraging and integrating existing datasets,
including 1) the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program with 44 congenital anomaly and
pediatric cancer cohorts, representing 20,000 patients and 48,000 genomes; 2) the All of Us Research
Program with WGS data on >90,000 individuals; and 3) the GOBACK Registry Linkage Birth Cohort, which
includes population-based data on >25 million live births. In Aim 1, we will analyze an expanded population-
based cohort of >25 million children to identify new CA-PC patterns and confirm previously reported patterns.
In Aim 2, we will analyze germline whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 2,000 children with both
congenital anomalies and pediatric cancer and over 20,000 children with either congenital anomalies or
pediatric cancer to identify novel pleiotropic genes harboring rare, pathogenic variants responsible for specific
CA-PC patterns. In Aim 3, we will describe the landscape of somatic alterations in pediatric cancers that result
from pathogenic CA-PC variants through the analysis of tumor-normal WGS and RNA-Seq data in 2,000
children. This work will generate novel insights into cancer predisposition and subsequently lead to improved
care for children with congenital anomalies, who comprise 120,000 births every year in the United States. In
addition, insights into cancer development among at-risk populations could provide clinical utility (e.g., genetic
counseling or therapeutic targets) for children and adults with cancer in the general population."
10912044,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One million individuals in the United States identify as transgender (0.39% of population), of which 90% are
either on gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or considering starting GAHT. Understanding how
feminizing GAHT (estradiol) and masculinizing GAHT (testosterone) influence immune function is imperative,
considering that (i) transgender women have a significantly increased prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) infection worldwide and (ii) little is known about how GAHT influences immune function or
susceptibility to infections.
To address this gap in knowledge, our team will combine established state-of-the-art systems immunology
approaches to a completed longitudinal cohort of transgender women before and during GAHT. We previously
used this longitudinal model to show that both feminizing and masculinizing GAHT induced DNA methylation
changes at specific genomic loci in whole peripheral blood, some of which were previously associated with
puberty or pregnancy.
In the first three aims of this project, we will use viably stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
transgender women at baseline, and 3 and 6 months following GAHT. By applying a systems immunology
approach, we first seek to establish how GAHT changes the circulating immune profile and plasma metabolites,
both of which are predictors of response to infection and vaccines. Next, innate, and adaptive immune function
will be assessed through in vitro stimulation with a range of microbial and viral microbes, specifically HIV,
followed by cytokine assays. Finally, in Aim 3 we will map the underlying epigenomic profile of specific immune
cell types, by profiling active histone modifications and open chromatin at single cell level. Together, the above
approach will identify the key molecular drivers of altered immune function in response to GAHT and generate
new hypotheses for further study. Ultimately, understanding how GAHT alters the molecular biology of immune
cells will open new avenues to therapeutic intervention in cases where immune function is compromised
because of GAHT.
In aim 4, we will use our established longitudinal GAHT recruitment strategy to establish a cohort of transgender
individuals with extensive biospecimen collection. This will allow us to explore the effects of GAHT on the vaginal
and fecal microbiota and stress, which are known modulators of immunity. Once established, this longitudinal
cohort will provide opportunities to apply a range of state-of-the-art molecular and immunophenotyping
techniques to understand if and how GAHT affects susceptibility to HIV infection."
10748380,"Candidate: I am an Assistant Professor in UAB’s Department of Psychiatry with a background in molecular
methods used in preclinical models and the role of intracellular pH dysregulation in neurodevelopmental
illnesses. Additionally, I have expertise in diagnosis and treatment of psychopathology having received my MD-
PhD from LSU Health Shreveport and completed a Psyhciatry Residency at Brown University.
Career Goals and Development: I hope to gain expertise in assessing schizophrenia (SZ)-associated
molecular disruptions in postmortem brain, in generating SZ patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) and differentiating them into disease relevant cell types, and in measuring cellular trafficking and
luminal pH through the use of fluorescently-tagged protein constructs. By acquiring these skills and completing
the studies laid out in this proposal, I will be well positioned and competitive for independent funding.
Research Project: Deficits in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) and trafficking are reported in
schizophrenia (SZ) brain, but the underlying cause is unknown. The function of organelles involved in PTM and
trafficking is greatly impacted by pH disruptions, and Na+/H+ Exchangers (NHE) 6-9 are major regulators of
organelle pH. In cancer cells, hypoxia causes altered energy metabolism and redistribution of NHE6 from
endosomes to the plasma membrane. Similar metabolic alterations are reported in SZ brain suggesting that
NHE6-9 intracellular distribution may also be affected, which could contribute to disrupted protein PTM and
trafficking. So far, I have found that NHE7/8 expression is decreased in SZ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC) while NHE6/9 is unchanged. Still, NHE6/9 show increased expression in a tissue fraction enriched for
synapses suggesting altered distribution of these proteins. Here, I propose to more extensively determine the
expression and distribution of NHE6-9 first in SZ postmortem DLPFC and then in excitatory cortical neurons
and astrocytes differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs. I will also determine how the introduction and
removal of an acute stressor (hypoxia) affects the distribution of these proteins in these cells. Finally, I will
transfect cells with fluorescently-tagged protein constructs to measure NHE6-9 and neurotransmitter receptor
trafficking as well as organelle pH in live cells. These studies could help identify novel treatment targets for SZ
and lead to high throughput assays to identify drugs that reverse SZ-associated molecular disruptions.
Mentorship: The primary mentorship team for this proposal consists of Dr. James Meador-Woodruff, a world
renowned expert in molecular disruptions in schizophrenia brain and analysis of postmortem brain tissue, Dr.
Marek Napierala, an expert on molecular mechanisms of repeat expansion disorders and of modeling these
illnesses using iPSCs differentiated into a variety of cell types including cortical neurons, and Dr. Vladimir
Parpura, an expert in glial biology and visualization of vesicular trafficking in live cells through the use of
fluorescently-tagged protein constructs."
10748381,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanistic basis for mutational processes that drive very rapid
evolution of cancer genomes. One process causing mutation bursts is chromothripsis, massive rearrangement
of one or a few chromosomes occurring within a single cell division. Under this grant, my group established a
general mechanism for chromothripsis. This work was enabled by our development of a novel technical
approach, the ability to combine live cell imaging, same cell isolation, and single cell whole genome sequencing
(Look-Seq). Chromothripsis originates from abnormal structures of the nucleus—micronuclei (MN) or
chromosome bridges. We identified a defect in nuclear envelope assembly on chromatin that lags within the
mitotic spindle. This results in nuclear envelope (NE) fragility and spontaneous NE rupture. Exposure of MN
chromatin to the interphase cytoplasm leads to extensive DNA damage, which is followed by a second wave of
DNA damage upon entry into mitosis. The first two aims of this proposal address the mechanisms leading to
chromosome fragmentation that is the basis for chromothripsis. First, building on preliminary data we will test
the hypothesis that exposure of MN chromatin to the interphase cytoplasm causes DNA damage via an aberrant
pathway of DNA base excision repair. Second, we propose hypothesis driven and unbiased approaches to
identify the mechanism of MN chromosome fragmentation in mitosis. Finally, we address the mechanism of
another poorly understood, common cancer genome catastrophe termed chromoplexy."
10984446,"ABSTRACT
 Alternative splicing wields extraordinary power in controlling protein function, cell development, and
tissue identity. Alternative splicing is a co- and post-transcriptional RNA processing mechanism that enables
a single gene to generate more than one transcript, thereby expanding the diversity of a cell’s proteome.
This ubiquitous mechanism of gene regulation occurs in more than 95% of multiexonic genes in humans.
The heart exhibits one of the most tissue specific and highly conserved alternative splicing programs, and
the reprogramming of these splicing patterns is a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases.
 In the heart, genes encoding membrane trafficking proteins are alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific
manner; however, how these events are regulated and the functional roles of these isoforms within
cardiomyocytes remains elusive. This proposal will investigate one specific membrane trafficking splicing
event that takes place in the gene encoding the clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) protein. CLTC classically
functions during clathrin-mediated endocytosis but plays unconventional structural roles as well. Cltc exon
31 alternative splicing occurs in the heart, and we have previously observed that deletion of Cltc exon 31
using CRISPR editing in mice impedes the progression of hypertrophy and heart failure after pressure
overload. I hypothesize that the regulation of Cltc exon 31 splicing in the heart modulates the endocytic and
structural functions of clathrin, which impacts cardiomyocyte cell growth. I will address this hypothesis with
two aims. In Aim 1, I will determine the physiological consequences of Cltc splicing in the heart by assessing
the impact of CLTC isoform expression on cardiomyocyte cell signaling, cytoskeleton architecture, and
protein-protein interactions (immunoblotting, confocal microscopy, and proteomics). In Aim 2, I will identify
the regulatory mechanism governing Cltc exon 31 splicing in the heart. I will demonstrate that the quaking
(QKI) and polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) RNA-binding proteins control Cltc exon 31 splicing
and that these RBPs bind with high affinity to consensus motifs located within the Cltc pre-mRNA transcript
(protein knockdowns, in vitro reconstitutions, and minigene reporter expression paired with motif deletions).
 My long-term goal is to have a research-intensive career and become an independent leader in
cardiovascular biology. The training that I will receive during this fellowship period will facilitate my scientific,
professional, and personal growth by providing opportunities to expand my experimental toolkit, network
with esteemed researchers, and increase my confidence as a strong scientist. Importantly, the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers a rich research community of RNA, cardiovascular, genetic, and
molecular cell biologists, and I have recruited mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these
fields. All of them are committed to educating and supporting me throughout my fellowship, which will set
me up for success with both my research proposal and my future scientific career."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, affecting approximately 6 million adults
in the United States, for which there is no cure or treatments which effectively slow progression of the disease.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have illuminated 75 loci associated with AD, but the causal variants
underlying the disease-associations remain to be identified, along with the genes or pathways through which
they act to regulate higher-order phenotypes. The integration of genomics with transcriptomics can inform the
influence of common genetic variation on molecular phenotypes consequential to cellular function. My lab has
shown that AD susceptibility loci are enriched for genetic variants which alter RNA levels and/or splicing, and
these variants often lie in cis-regulatory elements enriched in myeloid cells. However, causal variants or genes
remain elusive for most loci associated with AD. This proposal will contribute a valuable resource for research
seeking to describe causal variants at GWAS risk loci and connect them to altered cellular function.
Intricate pre- and post-transcriptional processing of awards vast functional diversity to RNA molecules, and
among the most abundant post-transcriptional modifications is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. In
protein-coding regions, these base-specific changes “recode” amino acid sequences, and in non-coding
regions, A-to-I editing fine-tunes genes by influencing the splicing, stability, and subcellular localization of RNA
transcripts, along with their ability to bind micro-RNAs (miRNAs). Disrupted RNA editing activity has been
widely reported in AD patients, but whether this is a consequence of the disease, or cause is not clear. This
proposal will address the contributions of RNA editing to AD pathophysiology by testing the hypothesis that
AD-associated genetic variants modulate A-to-I editing. I will use quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to relate
common genetic variation to level of RNA editing at A-to-I events genome-wide in the brain and myeloid cells.
Then, I will apply advanced statistical approaches to determine whether the genetic regulators of A-to-I editing
reside in GWAS risk loci for AD. Importantly, I will implement appropriate methodology probing mediation, to
parse bona fide causal gene regulatory pathways apart from pleiotropy or spurious effects of genetic
associations. By prioritizing A-to-I editing sites which are subject to tight genetic regulation and resolving the
molecular and cellular processes they help to orchestrate, the results from this work lay critical foundation for
follow-up functional studies which can harness the power of RNA based therapeutics to develop treatments for
AD."
10903700,"Project Summary
The reported two-fold excess risk of thyroid cancer in multiple World Trade Center (WTC) cohorts
is not solely explained by overdiagnosis due to surveillance or physician bias. Endocrine
disruptors (EDs), known to disrupt thyroid function and associated with thyroid carcinogenesis
and cancer aggressiveness, have been found in WC dust samples. WTC dust-associated EDs’
exposure may potentially be associated with thyroid carcinogenesis and thyroid cancer
aggressiveness via multiple pathways, in particular in children and adolescents exposed to the
WTC dust during these critical developmental windows.
Thyroid cancer in the WTC survivors’ population is largely unstudied and no study to date has
investigated the potential impact of early life exposure to the WTC dust cloud on thyroid
carcinogenesis and cancer aggressiveness. Using the WTC Environmental Health Center
survivor population, including individuals who were <18 years at the time of WTC exposure, we
aim to investigate the clinical, mutational, pathological, and inflammatory thyroid cancer profiles,
hypothesizing that (early life) WTC exposure is associated with more aggressive thyroid cancer.
First, we will perform an in-depth assessment comparing the clinical and mutational
characteristics of WTC thyroid cancer to non-exposed controls (aim 1). Additionally, we will
compare WTC thyroid cancer cases in the survivor population with unexposed control cancer
cases to investigate the pathological features using computational modelling approaches (aim 2)
and the gene expression profiles using Spatial Gene Expression (aim 3). We will perform a
subgroup analysis of the individuals < 18 years at the time of WTC exposure.
This study would be the first in-depth study to investigate thyroid cancer in the WTC survivor
population, including an assessment of thyroid cancer in patients exposed as children or
adolescents, integreting novel techniques including computational pathology modelling and
Spatial Gene Expression. The proposed methods can easily be transposed to other solid cancers
with increased risk in the WTC survivor population and to other environmentally exposed
populations with increased cancer risk. Furthermore, identifying phenotypes and biomarkers
associated with increased risk of more aggressive thyroid cancer will help identify patients
needing more aggressive thyroid cancer screening and management and may lead to more
effective health care delivery for this population."
10908620,"This project will develop and test a scale-up focused implementation approach for addressing pregnancy-related
and -associated morbidity and mortality (PRAMM) disparities. Previous efforts have shown that use of hospital-
focused maternal safety bundles are an important part of successful efforts to reduce PRAMM. However, overall
quality of obstetric care improved in these efforts without any effect on disparities. Thus, unlike previous efforts,
the proposed project will implement quality improvement bundles that: (1) focus on PRAMM disparities; and (2)
focus on community care (i.e., care provided outside the hospital in outpatient and other community settings)
and coordination among care settings. Given that 83% of U.S. pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated
deaths occur during pregnancy or postpartum (rather than around the time of delivery), outpatient and
community efforts are vital. Bundles (the evidence-based practices to be implemented) are developed by the
national Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health Community Care Initiative (AIM-CCI), and include
“Community care for postpartum safety and wellness,” and “Community care for maternal mental health,”
“Chronic conditions,” and “Intimate partner violence” bundles. All bundles target PRAMM disparities.
 • Aim 1 of the proposed project will analyze bundle implementation experiences in 2 counties to develop a
 county-wide scale-up focused implementation approach for the bundles in partnership with stakeholders date
 to create and manualize a scale-up implementation intervention.
 • Aim 2 will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the scale-up implementation intervention
 using a stepped wedge design in 12 Michigan counties with a total population of nearly 6 million people.
 PRAMM outcomes (individual level) will be extracted from a pre-existing statewide linked dataset. The
sample for these analyses will include all Medicaid insured individuals in the 12 counties observed during
pregnancy, at birth, and up to 1 year postpartum during the project period (~151,920 births, including ~49,110
births to African American and/or Hispanic mothers). Implementation outcomes (provider-level) include
 scale-up (penetration, reach, control for delivery, and intervention effectiveness at scale) and sustainment
 (maintenance of fidelity to core elements, health benefits, and capacity to deliver core elements over time).
This project is innovative because it: (1) is the first controlled implementation trial to test approaches to
implementing quality improvement bundles that: (a) specifically target PRAMM disparities; and (b) focus on
community care; (2) advances the science of scale-up (it is the first study of which we are aware to test scale-
up or sustainment implementation approaches to addressing maternal morbidity/mortality disparities); and (3)
works to improve services across many (vs. a single) health systems. The project is significant because we
need to reach pregnant people at scale, and scale-up is an understudied aspect of implementation science."

(1) Contribute to the thematic focus of the Center; (2) Create cooperative and equitable partnerships between
the Center and the community partners in each stage of the research process (concept, implementation,
evaluation, and dissemination); (3) Use a novel, theory-based approach to dissemination that coordinates
dissemination activities among community members, partner organizations, and policymakers; and (4) Translate
findings into sustainable community and system-level changes locally, statewide, and nationally. The CPC will
create an action-oriented, inclusive, broad-based stakeholders’ consortium to act as full partners in increasing
the relevance and reach of Center activities. The CPC will engage members in promoting the utility, uptake,
dissemination, scalability, and sustainability of Center findings, and building maternal health equity research and

Michigan State University with extensive experience in community engaged research and building successful
community-academic partnerships, including for NIH Centers and national organizations. In addition, the CPC
brings national dissemination and implementation science expertise to the tasks of disseminating and translating
Center findings, including a novel, theory-based approach to dissemination and an entire Center Project (Project
3) dedicated to advancing the science of scale-up. Our group of CPC partners is uncommonly dedicated, skilled,
and connected. All of the CPC partners have expertise in or and understanding of the health equity framework.
Each has developed local and national partnerships and some degree of experience in health disparities
research, practice, and policy. The CPC will increase capacity to build collaborations and partnerships to
advance equity in maternal health. We will seek to build upon each of the partners’ networks to add relevant
partners to the CPC, creating a network of networks for the Center. Center projects and public policy connections

derstand and address multilevel factors causing PRAMM disparities. As our projects address PRAMM disparities
at the patient, community, provider, and systems levels, so too will our training program. The overall goal of the
Center’s Training Component is to engage and prepare junior investigators, with a focus on early-stage investi-
gators from backgrounds or identities currently underrepresented in the health sciences, to conduct research
that addresses the biological, behavioral, environmental, and structural determinants of PRAMM and disparities.
 The Training Component will leverage the expertise and networks of Center investigators and community

multilevel interventions, dissemination and implementation science, analysis of population-level data, random-
ized trial designs, factorial designs, quasi-experimental studies, and analysis of claims data. Center investigators
also bring expertise on using mobile health to reduce disparities and substantive knowledge and experience
testing interventions for understudied causes of PRAMM disparities, including partner violence, suicide, sub-

10755329,"This K01 application is for Dr. Samaneh Farsijani to establish a research career in Nutritional Epidemiology and
acquire skills to integrate omics (gut microbiome) and non-omics (dietary intake) data towards her long-term goal
in “Precision Nutrition” to develop age-specific dietary recommendations, replacing the current one-size-fits-all
approach, to promote healthy aging. The proposal is derived from the candidate’s extensive training in nutrition
and interdisciplinary research background in biology and epidemiology. The proposed training goals are directed
to advance candidate’s skills in 1) aging & nutritional epidemiology; 2) advanced biostatistics; 3) gut microbiome;
and 4) career development. Acquired skills will be applied toward the proposed scientific goal to determine the
relationships between protein intake, gut microbiome, inflammation, and mobility loss in older adults. Aging is
associated with inefficient utilization of dietary proteins, due to anabolic resistance, which potentially leads to
functional losses. Also, up to 50% of US older adults fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
for protein (0.8 g/kg body weight/d). Therefore, a higher protein intake, above the RDA (1.0-1.2 g/kg/d), has been
suggested to compensate for changes in protein metabolism and to maintain muscle health in aging. However,
this strategy has not been incorporated into dietary guidelines due to inconclusive evidence from small and short-
term studies, which were unable to show the underlying mechanisms and causal relationships between protein
intake and mobility function in older adults. Gut dysbiosis (i.e., changes in gut microbiome) and inflammaging
(i.e., low-grade chronic inflammation in aging) have been linked to frailty in older adults. Since diet plays a key
role in shaping the gut microbiome and inflammation, it may be speculated that the effects of protein intake on
mobility function are mediated through alterations of dysbiosis and inflammaging. Our central hypotheses are:
i) high protein intake reduces the risk of mobility limitation by ameliorating inflammaging; ii) different protein
intake metrics are independently associated with gut microbiome and inflammaging; and iii) gut dysbiosis is
associated with mobility impairment in older adults. This proposal will leverage data from Health, Aging & Body
Composition (Health ABC), and Study of Muscle, Mobility & Aging (SOMMA) cohorts to address three Aims:
Aim 1: To simulate a pragmatic clinical trial using the Health ABC cohort to determine i) the effect of protein
intake on the risk of mobility limitation, and ii) its causal mediation by amelioration of inflammaging. Aim 2: a)
To characterize the associations between different metrics of protein intake (i.e., quantity, source and within-day
distribution pattern), gut microbiome composition, and fecal metabolites; and b) to determine the association
between gut dysbiosis and inflammaging in SOMMA. Aim 3: To determine the cross-sectional associations
between gut microbial composition and fecal metabolites with mobility (i.e., gait speed) in older adults from
SOMMA. This project will broaden our insights into the influence of protein intake, as a modifiable factor, on gut
microbiome, inflammaging, and muscle health in aging with the ultimate goal to drive age-specific dietary advice."

 Project Summary: This proposal describes a 5-year research training program that will develop Dr. Patrick
Hume into an independent basic and translational physician-scientist investigator. His long-term career goal is
to advance the fields of COPD and macrophage biology through the elucidation targets to block or repair the
development of small-airways disease in cigarette smokers. During this K08 Award, Dr. Hume will gain specific
career development training and mentorship closely aligned with an innovative research plan. He proposes to
study the role of Lyve-1 positive interstitial macrophages in the development of small airway pathology induced
by chronic cigarette smoke. Given the broad applicability to COPD, this work is directly relevant to the NHLBI.
 Candidate: Patrick Human MD, PhD is a board-certified Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine physician-
scientist at National Jewish Health in Denver, CO. His record of basic science research, Ph.D. training and
scientific publications demonstrates a firm commitment to a career as an academic clinician-scientist.
 Training: The proposed career development plan augments Dr. Hume’s prior mentored research during his
undergraduate, doctoral, medical residency and fellowship training. He proposes to meet his short-term
objectives through an integrated combination of intensive mentoring by internationally renowned experts in
macrophage biology and COPD pathogenesis with didactic and hands-on experiences in (i) data analysis, (ii)
cell biology, (iii) hyaluronic acid signaling, (iv) scientific writing and presentation, and (v) laboratory leadership.
 Mentor / Environment: Dr. Hume has close working relationships with highly experienced mentors and
collaborators who contribute expertise in macrophage and lung biology (Drs. Janssen and Petrache), COPD
pathogenesis and hyaluronic acid signaling (Dr. Petrache), matrix metalloproteinase biology and tissue
remodeling (Dr. Redente), creation of transgenic mouse models (Dr. Matsuda) and design-based stereology
(Dr. Smith). The proposed activities will be based at National Jewish Health, a top-ranked research institution.
 Research Project: The primary objective of this proposal is to identify the mechanism by which peribronchial
interstitial macrophages (PBIMs) mediate airway wall remodeling and pathogenesis in response to chronic
cigarette smoke exposure. Specifically, our studies will test the hypothesis that Lyve-1 expressed on a subset
of PBIMs binds to hyaluronic acid resulting in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) production, leading to airway
wall remodeling and fibrosis. This will be tested in human and murine lung tissue using quantitative
morphometry and immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, in vitro models of hyaluronic acid signaling, and
transgenic animal models. In doing so, the specific relationships between Lyve-1+ PBIM recruitment, MMP-9
production, and airway wall remodeling will be elucidated."
10755333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Shortage of organs for transplantation is one of the largest unmet medical needs. Researchers are currently
working on a variety of ways to increase the number of organs available. Recently, the prospect of producing
human organs in animals via interspecies blastocyst complementation has raised important attention and may
constitute an innovative approach to overcome the worldwide shortage of donor organs. Interspecies blastocyst
complementation works by injecting donor pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from one species into the
organogenesis-disabled blastocyst of a different species. The growing host embryo can provide an emptied
developmental organ niche for donor cells to occupy. Despite the potential, however, recent work revealed that
although donor PSCs can initially engraft to inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts from distantly related host
species, their chimeric contribution to early post-implantation stages is low. These results suggest the existence
of embryonic xenogeneic barriers between evolutionarily distant species. Unlike chimera formation within the
same species, a multitude of factors can differ significantly between species, which preclude robust chimerism.
Cell competition, a conserved fitness-sensing process during which fitter cells eliminate neighboring less-fit but
viable cells, has been proposed as a surveillance mechanism to ensure normal development and tissue
homeostasis, and has also been suggested to act as a barrier to interspecies chimerism. During chimera
formation, xenogeneic donor PSCs may be treated as unfit or aberrant cells and targeted for elimination. Most
recently, we developed an interspecies PSC co-culture strategy and discovered a previously unknown mode of
cell competition between species. Interspecies competition between PSCs occurred in primed but not naive
pluripotent cells, and between evolutionarily distant species. By comparative transcriptome analysis, we found
that genes related to the NF-κB and p53 signaling pathways, among others, were upregulated in less-fit ‘loser’
human cells. Genetic inactivation of TP53, a core component (P65, also known as RELA) and an upstream
regulator (MYD88) of the NF-κB complex in human PSCs could overcome their competitive elimination by co-
cultured mouse PSCs, thereby improving the survival and chimerism of human cells in early mouse embryos.
Based on extensive preliminary results, in this proposal, we will further dissect the mechanisms underlying
interspecies primed PSC competition in both loser and winner cells. And, by suppressing interspecies PSC
competition, we aim to improve chimerism and provide the proof-of-concept of interspecies blastocyst
complementation from donor PSCs of rhesus monkey, our close kin, in distantly related mouse host."

screening uptake, improve management of screen positives, facilitate precancer treatment access and optimize
precancer treatments for cervical cancer prevention for WLWH.
Through partnership with LVCT Health Dhibiti HIV/TB CDC/PEPFAR funded care program and leveraging on-
going implementation science studies conducted in the selected public health facilities, we propose in Aim 1, to
provide infrastructure to recruit, enroll and retain WLWH to the UG1 network studies. The three
selected facilities have an estimate of 4,000 WLWH enrolled in the HIV/TB care clinics, with the option to
expand to 10,000 by incorporating the ten TIBA study clinics. In Aim 2, we propose to interface with the UG1
Research Bases and U24 Network Coordinating Center during concept and protocol development to provide
insights and input on issues pertaining to clinical significance, study feasibility, implementation
and contribute towards raising up relevant priority research questions. KEMRI-CCR-PHRD co-PIs
have participated in multiple multisite clinical trials and have been protocol chairs on network studies. In Aim
3, we propose to provide on-site operational leadership for the successful conduct of the network clinical trials.

This application is responsive to RFA-ES-18-009: Maintain and Enrich Resource Infrastructure for
Existing Environmental Epidemiology Cohorts
Project Viva is a Boston-area cohort of 2,128 mother-child pairs from whom we have collected information on
numerous environmental exposures and health outcomes beginning in early pregnancy in 1999-2002. Our
almost two decades of data thus traverse numerous sensitive periods of the lifecourse: from gestation though
adolescence for index participants, and from pregnancy into the perimenopausal period for their mothers. Our
rich database comprises detailed information on a wealth of environmental exposures including daily air
pollution exposure estimates from satellites, local monitors, and geographic information systems; measures of
built and natural environments; biomarkers of toxicants including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
and metals; and maternal and child diet. Existing research-quality outcomes include measures of
cardiometabolic health for both mothers and children (anthropometry, body composition, blood pressure, and
biomarkers of glycemia, lipids, and adipokines); child cognition and behavior; child lung function and atopy; as
well as genetic variants and epigenetic markers.
The overall goals of the current proposal are to 1) bolster retention of Project Viva index participants through
adolescence into the young adult transition, 2) build infrastructure for future science through development and
implementation of remote data collection methods using modern technology, with a focus on environmental
exposures, and 3) enhance our data management infrastructure to facilitate data sharing with the broader
scientific community. These activities will complement our existing active grants supporting data collection and
analysis, including participation in the NIH’s Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO)
Program.
The wealth of data and biosamples already available in Project Viva provide a unique opportunity to continue
to advance the research priorities of NIEHS, including examining the influence of early-life environmental
exposures, alone and in combination with other exposures and genetics, on development of chronic disease.
The proposed infrastructure activities will improve the availability of Project Viva data to the wider research
community, while simultaneously supporting our efforts to maintain this valuable resource and position our
cohort to examine novel scientific questions in the future. The enhanced infrastructure will also provide a
scalable foundation to support ongoing enrichment of the Project Viva protocols and datasets."
10764333,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Hoarding disorder (HD) is a chronic, progressive, and debilitating psychiatric condition that leads to
devastating personal and community consequences, particularly for older adults. HD is defined by persistent
difficulty discarding or parting with possessions due to distress associated with discarding, urges to save,
and/or difficulty making decisions about what to keep and what to discard. As a result, clutter accumulates and
fills active living areas, preventing the normal use of space and resulting in distress and disability. Community
epidemiological reports estimate the prevalence of clinically significant hoarding symptoms at 7% in individuals
over age 60 and even higher rates in those over age 70. HD is the only neuropsychiatric condition that
progresses in severity and population prevalence with age apart from dementia.
 Inhibition and cognitive switching have been identified as key deficits in older adults with HD. These
executive functioning areas are consistent with the RDoC cognitive control domain and particularly the goal
selection, updating, representation, and maintenance subconstruct. Findings suggest that these deficits may
contribute to the symptomatic expression of HD, degree of functional impairment, and modest responses to HD
treatment. Furthermore, anticipatory and experiential fear and anxiety, consistent with the RDoC constructs of
acute and potential threat, lead to sustained problems with discarding items and clutter accumulation. When
these constructs are targeted, our group has produced clinically and statistically significant outcomes.
 Consistent with NIMH strategic goal 3.1, to arrive at effective treatment approaches for unmet therapeutic
domains in behavioral science, this project seeks to conduct the first confirmatory efficacy trial for older adults
with HD. We propose a RCT comparing CREST to a case management control condition for 150 adults age 50
and older with HD. We are examining age as a moderator and will therefore include both midlife and late life
participants. An evaluation of treatment outcome, including hoarding severity and functional outcomes, will be
conducted at baseline (0 months), mid-treatment (3 months), end of treatment (6 months), 3-month (9 months)
and 6-month follow-up (12 months). Participants will receive 26 weekly 60-minute individual sessions over the
course of 32 weeks maximum (6-7.5 months). They will receive 50% in home and 50% office visits. We will
examine factors that mediate improvement in CREST (improved inhibition/cognitive switching and reduction in
fear/anxiety of discarding items) through physiological, behavioral, self-report, and paradigm assessments.
Individual factors (e.g., age and other demographic factors, baseline cognitive control, baseline hoarding
severity) and treatment factors (e.g., session attendance) will be evaluated as moderators. The specific aims
include determining confirmatory efficacy of CREST, mechanisms of CREST effects, and moderators of
CREST. If successful, this project would lead to an effectiveness trial in a real world setting."

Food insecurity is a significant public health concern and is defined as limited or uncertain access to enough
food for an active and healthy lifestyle. Food insecurity impacts 15.7% of households with children in the U.S.,
but its effects on child growth and developmental trajectories are not well documented. In this K99/R00 Pathway
to Independence Award project, I propose research aims to better understand the impact of early life food
insecurity on child growth and development. I will utilize data from two ongoing birth cohort studies at the
Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) to assess the effects of food insecurity during
pregnancy and intermittent and persistent food insecurity during early childhood on 1) maternal obesity and
cognitive function, and 2) childhood growth and cognitive development trajectories from early childhood to age
18. This will be the first study to simultaneously examine the role of food insecurity trajectories in child and
adolescent cognitive development and obesity. This research will combine cutting edge body composition
measurement, cognitive assessment and epidemiologic methods and will contribute important substantive
knowledge on the food insecurity-obesity and the food insecurity-cognitive function associations within children
and adolescents. This work will also provide novel insight to inform evidence-based recommendations and
interventions around child and adolescent obesity. During the K99 phase, my work will be situated within the top-
tier research environments of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, the CCCEH and the NY Obesity
Research Center, all of which have a strong focus on policy translation and community partnerships. Situating
my K99/R00 work in a research environment focused on policy translation and analysis will provide me with
experience and training in how research findings and data can contribute to policy debates and to the generation
of new data driven policies. The training goals of this K99/R00 are to become skilled in complex longitudinal data
analyses, body composition assessment in children and adolescents using bio-impedance and magnetic
resonance imaging, child cognitive development assessment using diagnostic tests, and collection and analysis
of quantitative data within a birth cohort. As part of the R00 phase, I will gain field experience in collecting
anthropometric and cognitive data from children. This work is a logical extension of my prior and ongoing
research in obesity, nutrition and food insecurity, and will fill gaps in training that I need to launch my career as
an independent scientist working at the intersection of epidemiology, urban health and social policy."
10763149,"Project Summary
 The pluripotent potential of a cell is generally assumed to be a product of its nucleus, regulated by gene
expression and chromatin state. This view informs most approaches to drug discovery, where an ideal
therapeutic would target nuclear processes to induce pluripotency and proliferation to heal a wound or inhibit
pluripotency and proliferation in cancer. Often overlooked are somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments that
definitively show cellular potential is also a product of the cytoplasm, specifically, the cytoplasm of germ cells.
The long-term objectives of this research are to understand how cellular pluripotency and regenerative capacity
are retained in germ cells through their specialized cytoplasm. We expect these findings to inform and expand
approaches to drug discovery and lead to therapeutics that function by targeting the cytoplasmic milieu.
 Cytoplasmic processes unique to germ cells often occur in protein/RNA assemblies that reside on or near
the nuclear periphery. These assemblies are collectively called germ granules. Because core germ-granule
composition is conserved from nematodes to humans, we can use C. elegans nematodes to visualize germ
granules in vivo and to expedite studies into their function. Mutations that displace or severely disrupt germ
granules in C. elegans cause sterility and germline-to-somatic reprogramming. In this proposal, we look at the
earliest events of somatic reprogramming to determine how processes within germ granules antagonize this fate.
We investigate the contribution of glycine-rich repeat motifs to the specialized germ-granule microenvironment.
We then describe two novel interactions with a core germ-granule protein called GLH-1 (DDX4 in humans). One
of these interactions with GLH-1 likely facilitates the hand-off of mRNAs from germ granules to initiate translation.
The other is a dynamic interaction with GLH-1 that activates a conserved cellular pathway to trigger engulfment
by surrounding soma. Lastly, we follow up on another core germ-granule protein that we named LOTR-1
(TDRD5/7 in humans) and its LOTUS-domain-dependent interaction with a 3’UTR binding complex. Together,
these findings will provide an understanding of cytoplasmic processes within germ granules that ensure the
pluripotent potential of germ cells."
10764239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This project aims to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for the higher prevalence of hypertension and
cardiovascular disease in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Although it has been suggested that
individuals with ASD may have sympathetic hyperactivity, limited studies using indirect measures have been
performed. To date, direct measures of resting sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) have not been made in
individuals with ASD. An exaggerated blood pressure response to acute exercise is typically seen in individuals
with hypertension and other chronic conditions, and such changes in blood pressure are also associated with an
increased risk of future stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Identifying neural and vascular mechanisms of
elevated blood pressure in the ASD population is an essential first step to inform future research on the efficacy
of clinical intervention to lower blood pressure in ASD; thus, it could reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality.
 The pressor response evoked during exercise is a result of neural inputs including activation of the
exercise pressor reflex to cause sympatho-excitation and activation of arterial baroreflex to cause sympatho-
inhibition. We aim to identify whether heightened SNA is a major contributor to augmented blood pressure during
exercise in ASD caused by augmented exercise pressor reflex activation (Aim 1). Further, we aim to determine
how sympathetically mediated vascular responses contribute to the blood pressure increase during exercise in
ASD (Aim 2), and whether impaired arterial baroreflex function contributes to augmented SNA and blood
pressure responses in ASD compared to controls (Aim 3). In these studies, we will directly measure muscle
SNA, skeletal muscle blood flow, and continuous blood pressure in both young adults with ASD and healthy
controls at rest and while they perform exercise. This study will be the first to investigate neural control
mechanisms of the cardiovascular system in an ASD population using state-of-the-art techniques. Thus far only
indirect measures (e.g., resting heart rate and blood pressure variability) have been employed to understand
autonomic dysfunction in ASD population. We will measure muscle SNA directly from the peroneal nerve using
microneurography technique for the first time in ASD population both at rest and during exercise. Identifying
sympathetic overactivity in ASD is important because it not only contributes to the hypertension but also may
accelerate the progression of other health complications including heart disease independent of any rise in blood
pressure. In addition, by using the unique noninvasive variable pressure neck chamber technique, we will identify
not only arterial baroreflex control of muscle SNA, but also control of blood pressure as an outcome both at rest
and during exercise.
 Collectively, with guidance from SC2 mentors who have expertise in clinical applications of autonomic
function and exercise testing and training in health and disease, this study will begin to identify pathophysiology
of early hypertension and cardiovascular disease in individuals with ASD. The findings will form the basis for
future experimental and clinical studies to determine an effective therapeutic target, enable improved patient
care, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for individuals with ASD."
10764240,"Fundamental and applied studies of nucleic acids
For 30 years the Maher laboratory has been investigating unresolved problems in nucleic acids biology and
biophysics. We will continue our collaborative efforts related to two major challenges in the ﬁeld. These
challenges are deliberately diverse and multidisciplinary, spanning fundamental and applied aspects of nucleic
acid structure and function. This work brings unique opportunities for synergy and creates an exceptional
training environment.
Challenge 1: Can principles learned from studies of bacterial DNA looping be applied to artiﬁcial DNA
looping for gene regulation?
Hypothesis 1.1: We hypothesize that small DNA loops form more easily in vivo than in vitro because a)
proteins bridge DNA loops to reduce required DNA bending, b) DNA supercoiling pre-bends DNA, and c)
architectural DNA binding proteins kink DNA. Molecular biology experiments will be performed in vitro and
using elements of the lac operon in living E. coli cells.
Hypothesis 1.2: We hypothesize that designed sequence-speciﬁc DNA binding proteins can be used to create
artiﬁcial gene regulatory loops in bacterial and eukaryotic systems. Our studies will implement novel
Transcription Activator-like Effector (TALE) proteins controlled by chemically-induced heterodimerization to
regulate model and endogenous genes by creating tight DNA loops that exclude RNA polymerase from gene
promoters. This work will impact synthetic biology efforts.
Challenge 2: Can we identify naked DNA aptamers that home to sub-cellular compartments?
Hypothesis 2.1: We hypothesize that the mechanism of nucleus-homing DNA aptamers we previously
identiﬁed using Ligase Proximity Selection can be understood by proteomics and this selection concept
extended to discover naked DNA aptamers that exhibit tissue-speciﬁc nuclear homing in mice.
Hypothesis 2.2: We hypothesize that our new Peroxidase Proximity Selection will identify homing DNA
aptamers speciﬁc for different sub-cellular compartments of interest. We will study peroxidase biotinylation
reward chemistry, undertake selections in live cultured cells, and explore the mechanism of discovered homing
aptamers as possible delivery agents for proteins and drugs.
Support for this proposal will sustain the Maher laboratory's productive research program addressing these two
important and unresolved challenges. The laboratory's track record shows that this investment will trigger
further innovations with impact beyond these two problems."
10764262,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Superficial fibrotic diatheses affect up to 7-12% of the United States male population. These conditions include
Peyronie’s Disease (PD), which results in penile plaques and resulting curvature during erection, and
Dupuytren’s Disease (DD), resulting in nodules of the palmar fasciae and hand contracture. While considered
benign, these conditions cause physical impairment and negatively affect relationships, and have been linked to
significant psychological ramifications, including clinical depression. These superficial fibrotic diatheses can be
heritable, co-existing in 15-22% of patients, and may be linked to other genetic conditions, including malignancy.
Current treatments are incompletely effective, in part due to a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of, and
molecular and genetic contributions to, these diatheses.
Previous work by our group identified microdeletions in several genes implicated in inflammation that may
predispose to fibrotic plaque formation. The proposed work will seek to understand the roles of these candidate
genes, NELL1, CTDSPL, and ZNF277 in fibrosis and inflammation contributing to PD and DD using in vitro
assays and animal models. Specifically, this basic research investigation addresses the hypothesis that NELL1,
CTDSPL, and ZNF277 modulate signaling pathways involved in fibrosis and inflammation, and that alterations
in gene dosage or function can predispose to aberrant collagen deposition and fibrotic plaque formation. The
proposed work will define the impact of alterations in expression and function of NELL1, CTDSPL, and ZNF277
on the TGF-β pathway in fibroblasts derived from patients with PD and/or DD and from genetically altered mice,
as well as the impact on collagen deposition and fibrosis in vitro. We will also investigate the impact of deficiency
of these genes on systemic and penile fibrosis using genetically altered mouse models to more definitively
establish causality in the setting of genetic defects in these genes.
The second aim of our project will utilize the Utah Population Database (UPDB) to identify familial cases of PD
and DD and to determine associated comorbid conditions in these patients. An exploratory analysis to identify
causal genetic alterations in familial PD and DD cases, with a focus on genes involved in the TGF-β pathway,
will also be performed.
The data obtained from this work will provide a detailed understanding of how NELL1, CTDSPL, and ZNF277
influence the formation of aberrant fibrosis on a molecular level and will also result in an understanding of the
spectrum of genetically influenced conditions that are associated with PD and DD. Together, these data will
provide the groundwork for improving patient diagnosis, risk stratification, and targeted treatment."
10764265,"For over 30 years the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS) has focused on examining the potential
developmental risks associated with low-level methylmercury (MeHg) exposure stemming from daily ocean fish
consumption during pregnancy, an issue of high public health significance. Our studies of over 3,000
participants have shown that nutrients, genetics, and maternal immune function play an important role. These
findings provide important clues towards better understanding mechanisms of low-level MeHg toxicity and
factors that may influence susceptibility. Our international research consortium includes four key partners with
expertise in toxicology, epidemiology, biostatistics, nutritional biochemistry, and human genetics. The SCDS is
a unique source of longitudinal data with extensive information on biomarkers and population characteristics. It
is imperative that this resource is preserved, thoroughly documented, and enriched to realize its long-term
scientific potential. The proposed study will lay the foundation for continued, integrative and translational
science examining MeHg toxicity mechanisms and the long-term dynamics of low-level MeHg exposure. The
current proposal has three specific aims. First, we will enrich the biorepository and outcomes database of
the NC2 cohort for future studies of underlying mechanisms of MeHg toxicity and clinically-relevant
phenotypes. We will re-examine 1,457 Nutrition Cohort 2 (NC2) participants who were recruited in 2008-2011
and are currently undergoing a 7-year examination. We will obtain hair and blood samples for future studies
focusing on mechanisms of MeHg metabolism and toxicity. We will also collect data on medical history,
sociodemographic factors, anthropometrics measures, health behaviors, and fish consumption, and we will link
our study records with school examination records. Second, we will enrich the biorepository and outcome
database of Main cohort study participants and their mothers to establish baseline data for novel
prospective studies of MeHg toxicity across the life course. We will re-enroll the Main cohort (n=615;
recruited in 1989-1990 and followed for 24 years) and their mothers (n=622, recruited in 1989-1990 and re-
enrolled in 2013) and update data on health behaviors, sociodemographic factors, medical history,
anthropometric measures, and fish consumption. We will collect hair and blood samples, and measure hair
MeHg levels to estimate exposure across 30 years of follow up. In the Main cohort we will examine markers of
autoimmune responses and correlate them with life course MeHg exposure estimates. Mothers will complete a
brief assessment of physical and cognitive functioning. Finally, we will facilitate data access and sharing
through improved data harmonization and discovery. We will develop an online Data Access Request and
Visualization Application that will consist of a standardized data dictionary across all SCDS cohorts. It will allow
users to explore our data through the visualization of descriptive statistics, and to request data and samples."
10764276,"In this competing renewal, we propose to continue the largest cohort study of young men who have sex
with men (YMSM) ever conducted. The RADAR study was launched in 2014 to provide critical insights into risk
and protective factors for HIV and drug use, and to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of an
effective strategy to end the epidemic. RADAR is reflective of the US HIV epidemic; it focuses on the ages with
the highest HIV incidence, has exceptional representation of minority HIV disparity groups (38% black, 30%
Latino), and is located in Chicago, an urban epicenter of the HIV and drug epidemics (i.e., Cook County was
4th in HIV incidence-2017). During our initial grant period, we were extremely productive in recruitment
(N>1,200), retention (>80%), scientific outputs (40+ publications), training future scholars, and serving as a
platform for innovative research (25+ connected studies; 7 concepts via NIDA C3PNO consortium).
 YMSM account for nearly 70% of all new HIV diagnoses among adolescents and young adults each
year in the U.S. While all other risk groups have declining incidence, dramatic increases continue among
YMSM of color. In an era of evolving prevention and treatment options, YMSM still show insufficient PrEP
utilization and fall off the HIV care cascade at high rates. Substance use and minority stressors, with
associated social, structural, and biological processes, are key factors that drive disparities. In response to
RFA-DA-20-005 we propose a sophisticated multilevel research design, in which we will enhance the cohort in
2020 with 300 new 16-20 year olds and continue to follow existing cohort members. In this renewal, we will
answer critical new questions about the HIV and substance use epidemics in YMSM. First (Aim 1), we will
keep a pulse on emerging trends in drug use, HIV risk/preventive behaviors, and care continuum engagement.
We will chart YMSM developmental trajectories of drug use into adulthood, with a novel focus on how use
trajectories and transitions are associated with drug consequences. Further, enrollment of multiple samples of
16-20 year olds (2008, 2011, 2015, 2020) allows us to disentangle historical (e.g., advent of PrEP; marijuana
legalization) and developmental changes in substance use, HIV risk and care. Next (Aim 2), we will continue to
enroll cohort members’ new serious partners. We will extend our prior work by longitudinally examining the key
role that dyadic processes play in the development of substance use problems and HIV risk behaviors and
transmission among coupled YMSM. Third (Aim 3), we will build on our provocative findings of high levels of
systemic inflammation in the RADAR cohort regardless of HIV status by collecting pathogenic biomarkers of
substance use to begin forecasting later-life morbidities for HIV+ and HIV- YMSM. Finally (Aim 4), RADAR will
continue to add specimens and data to our well-characterized biobehavioral repository to provide a platform for
high-impact science. RADAR is a unique multilevel and longitudinal study of diverse YMSM—its continuation
will provide critical data to inform strategies to end the HIV epidemic."

This Liquid Biopsy Research Laboratory (LBRL) will address specific unmet clinical needs in the early
assessment of cancer by developing and validating multi-analyte liquid biopsy (LBx) technologies in distinct
clinical contexts to maximize patient benefit by bringing together clinical, research, and industry experts. The
LBRL proposed research is motivated by preliminary work published by us and others that indicate tumors leak
detectable levels of multiple analytes, potentially early in tumor evolution, into the circulatory system. Here we
propose three research projects that will address current clinical gaps in the early assessment of cancer using
LBx technologies to maximally leverage resources toward gaining sufficient evidence for clinical implementation
of at least one project by the end of the initial period. Clinical utilities will be explored in both screening and
diagnostic workup in the early assessment of cancer with a focus on refining and validating technologies,
methods, and assays for LBx and a particular emphasis on integrating the genomics and proteomics of single
cells, as well as oncosomes, along with plasma genomics and proteomics to configure a final, clinically impactful
assay. Aim 1 will focus on developing a comprehensive LBx-based companion to mammography for the early
assessment of breast cancer (BC) with a focus on the `intent to treat' population of patients undergoing screening.
Subaims include technology refinement for (1) a fit for purpose test consisting of previously validated
immunofluorescence (IF) assays to characterize rare epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells as
well as oncosomes; and (2) existing comprehensive tests adapted for the requirements of low disease burden
using multi-omic, multi-analyte approach for diagnostic workup following a positive mammogram or following a
positive LBx screening test. Aim 2 will focus on developing enhanced screening and diagnostic workup for
pancreatic cancer (PANC) through multi-omic capabilities on cells and plasma to create a multi-modal LBx aimed
at a fit for purpose test appropriate as a screening tool prior to diagnostic imaging or an information-rich adjunct
to an EUS procedure. Aim 3 is focused on the development of a PB LBx as a substitute to bone marrow aspirate
(BMA) to diagnosed myeloma precursor states (MGUS and SMM) and detect the transition to multiple myeloma
to easily identify candidates for early treatment intervention. The overall partnership team of the LBRL is
leveraging established collaborations with a track record of identifying the clinical gap, designing studies that
have a high likelihood of timely recruitment of patients and successful procurement of samples, technological
innovation and refinement, compliant and scalable commercial solution development, and deployment into
clinical care."

Michael Combs, MD, MS is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician at the University of Michigan. This K23
proposal outlines the mentored research and training required for Dr. Combs to achieve his long-term goal of
becoming an independent physician-scientist and a leader in understanding the factors which cause and
perpetuate chronic rejection after lung transplantation.
The leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality after lung transplant is chronic rejection, also called
chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Currently, no effective prediction models exist either for 1) the
development of CLAD among healthy lung transplant recipients and 2) survival after CLAD development. This
key research gap limits both clinicians’ ability to personalize care and researchers’ ability to design, power, and
stratify clinical trials. CLAD develops and evolves within a complex interplay of 1) altered lung microbiota, 2)
recipient-derived immune responses, and 3) fibrotic remodeling orchestrated by activated allograft-derived
mesenchymal cells. In previously published studies, Dr. Combs has demonstrated that signals in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from across these biological domains represent novel risk factors for CLAD
with plausible roles in disease pathogenesis.
In this proposal, Dr. Combs will develop clinical risk prediction models for CLAD development and post-CLAD
survival which integrate patient-specific clinical data and the biological signals in BAL fluid. By completing
these Aims, Dr. Combs will develop new experience and expertise in patient-oriented clinical research,
microbiome-focused computational biology, advanced statistical analysis (including machine learning
approaches), and transplant-focused lung immunology. His training will be supervised by his co-mentors,
Robert Dickson, MD, and Vibha Lama, MD, MS, who have decades of experience and expertise in clinical
research, mentorship of aspiring physician-scientists, and the translational study of lung transplantation, the
lung microbiome (Dr. Dickson), and mesenchymal cell biology (Dr. Lama). His training will further be supported
by an advisory committee with expertise in advanced computational biology and statistical modeling/machine
learning approaches (Susan Murray, ScD) and pulmonary immunology (Bethany Moore, PhD).
Completion of this progressively independent research project will lead to subsequent R03 and R01
applications validating these prediction models of CLAD development and post-CLAD survival in prospective,
multi-center cohorts."
10783323,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need for novel therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The
over-production of longer, aggregation-prone β-amyloid (Aβ) fragments (including Aβ42 and 43) relative to
shorter, non-aggregating fragments (including Aβ37 and 38) are likely critical drivers of disease in both late-
onset, sporadic AD (LOAD) and autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). The balance between production of
aggregating and non-aggregating forms of Aβ is a direct result of the kinetics by which the γ-secretase
complex sequentially cleaves amyloid precursor protein. Alterations in γ-secretase function can have profound
neurodegenerative and cognitive consequences, while modulation of γ-secretase has therapeutic potential in
LOAD and ADAD. Pathogenic variants in Presenilin-1 (PSEN1), the key catalytic subunit in the γ-secretase
complex, are the most common cause of ADAD. There is substantial heterogeneity in Age of Symptom Onset
(a range of >30 years) and biomarker progression across PSEN1 variants. The proposed K01 project will
characterize differences in γ-secretase function across ~250 unique ADAD-causing PSEN1 variants in the
presence and absence of two structurally distinct γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), measured in a cell-based
model system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, variant-specific characteristics will be combined with cross-sectional cognitive
and biomarker measures from carriers of corresponding PSEN1 variants participating in the Dominantly
Inherited Alzheimer’s Network Observational Study (DIAN-Obs), a large international study in which over 80
unique PSEN1 pathogenic variants are represented. This translational dataset will be used to examine whether
differences in γ-secretase function between PSEN1 mutations can account for the heterogeneity in Age of
Symptom Onset, cognition, and AD biomarkers. Aim 3 will utilize longitudinal data from DIAN-Obs to examine
whether mutation-specific characteristics 1) predict change in biomarkers and cognition and 2) increase power
to detect estimated treatment effects for relevant trial outcomes. Leveraging available data from DIAN Trials
Unit, exploratory analyses will assess whether inclusion of variant-dependent characteristics can improve
stratification approaches for future clinical trials. This K01 will elucidate mechanisms underlying AD, facilitate
ongoing ADAD clinical trials, and support the development of GSMs as possible therapeutics. To help Dr.
Stephanie Schultz achieve these aims, a multidisciplinary mentorship team has been assembled from the
Harvard Medical School community and DIAN Leadership team to complement coursework in protein
characterization, translational research, advanced statistical analysis, and clinical trials. Dr. Jasmeer Chhatwal
will be the primary mentor overseeing research and career progress. Dr. Schultz will receive mentoring from
Dr. Dennis Selkoe on the mechanisms underlying AD, Drs. Reisa Sperling and Eric McDade on translational
and clinical trial design, and Dr. Chengjie Xiong on advanced statistical methods for translational research.
This comprehensive training plan will enable Dr. Schultz to become an independent translational scientist."
10783411,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
This application seeks a career development award for an academic vitreoretinal surgeon with an interest in high
myopia, a condition which predisposes patients to potentially blinding complications including retinal tears (RTs)
and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRDs). This proposal is a 5-year curriculum and research plan to
transition Dr. Cassie Ludwig to independence. The candidate is an accomplished early career physician-scientist
who will undergo all training and execute the research noted herein during this period.
Myopia affects one third of the world's population today and has been predicted to affect 50% of the world's
population by 2050.1,2 Worse, this prediction is likely an underestimate as myopigenic behaviors have been
further compounded by the COVID pandemic and digital remote learning.3–8 This increasing prevalence has
significant consequences as each diopter of myopia increases the risk of retinal tears and detachments, myopic
macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, myopic traction maculopathy, strabismus, glaucoma, and
cataracts. Slowing myopia progression even minimally can help prevent blindness. Using combined data from
five large population-based studies, Bullimore et al. found that slowing myopia by one diopter should reduce the
likelihood of a patient developing an RRD by 30%.2
Electronic health records (EHRs) and ophthalmic imaging databases contain enormous quantities of systemic
and ocular data generated by clinical practice which can be used to better understand the relationship between
systemic and ophthalmic risk factors, myopia and RTs and RRDs. EHR and imaging data can be fused into
predictive models that employ machine learning to risk-stratify patients.
In this proposal, Dr. Ludwig aims to achieve the following: 1. Develop and validate a structured EHR deep
learning framework to predict RT and RRD risk in myopes and non-myopes 2. Develop and validate an
unstructured EHR transformer-based deep learning model to predict RT and RRD risk in myopes and
non-myopes, and 3. Develop and validate an ultra-widefield photography convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based deep learning model to predict RT and RRD risk in myopes and non-myopes. The central
hypothesis is that modeling of attributes from EHR data and images can predict risk of RTs and RRDs.
The principal investigator, Cassie A. Ludwig, MD, MS, will perform this research as part of a larger effort to obtain
additional training and mentorship in biomedical informatics, artificial intelligence, biodesign, and myopia. Dr.
Ludwig’s career development plan includes a PhD program with didactic coursework, conferences, workshops,
and frequent communication and interaction with a network of mentors with an impressive abundance of their
own NIH funding and prior mentorship experiences. This experience will guide Dr. Ludwig into a career as an
independent clinician-scientist with expertise in artificial intelligence and a focus on myopia and its sequelae."
10783589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this career development award is to provide me with the training necessary to develop an
independent aging research program focusing on neuroimaging biomarkers and socioeconomic risk factors
associated with differential aging trajectories and vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with the long-term
goal of informing and improving risk prediction for AD and potential interventions and treatment to reduce AD
risk. To achieve these goals, I propose to examine how alterations of brain functional and structural
connectomes underlie cognitive aging and its longitudinal trajectories, and contribute to individual vulnerability
to AD in cognitively normal individuals. Moreover, I propose to investigate how socioeconomic status may
modulate the associations of brain connectomes with cognitive aging and risk for AD. My training to date has
provided me with a strong methodological and theoretical foundation in cognitive neuroscience and
neuroimaging, and advanced computational analyses to examine brain connectomes. My proposed training
plan complements my existing expertise by providing training in the study of cognitive and brain aging,
socioeconomic risk factors and biological processes and markers associated with aging and AD. Completion of
the proposed research and training will enable my transition to independence and allow me to build an
interdisciplinary aging research program that integrates neuroimaging, cognitive, and biological assessments.
Research Project: Converging evidence has shown that connectivity and topological properties of brain
connectomes underpin cognitive aging and contribute to the accumulation and spreading of AD pathologies.
However, connectome-based (i.e., connectomic) biomarkers of cognitive aging trajectories have not been
characterized in large-scale longitudinal studies, especially with regard to their potential in indexing early
vulnerability to AD in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Moreover, there has been a lack of research on these
topics in socially disadvantaged groups with high AD prevalence. The proposed project will address these
critical research gaps using two large-scale longitudinal studies with cognitive, neuroimaging, and biological
measures: Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities and Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Specifically,
I will examine whether longitudinal changes in brain connectomes are associated with changes in multiple
cognitive domains, serving as putative connectomic biomarkers of cognitive aging trajectories (Aim 1). I will
then examine whether longitudinal changes in brain connectomes are associated with changes in levels of AD-
related pathologies as measured from PET and plasma (Aim 2). Finally, I will examine whether low
socioeconomic status (SES), an indicator of social disadvantage, modulates the associations between brain
connectomes, cognition, and AD-related pathologies (Aim 3). The project will inform efforts aimed at
establishing neuroimaging biomarkers for early identification of individuals at risk for cognitive impairment and
AD, as well as understanding the role of SES in cognitive and brain aging and AD risk."
10786020,"Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell tolerance to self is incompletely understood despite wide-spread
acceptance of the now familiar “missing-self” hypothesis. Serving as a guiding principle for
several decades, it proposed that NK cells survey tissues for ubiquitously expressed major
histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules as self. Normal levels of MHCI do not
allow NK cell attack but if MHCI is down-regulated in a pathologic event, NK cells attack. The
applicant and his laboratory discovered the Ly49 family of receptors specific for target cell
MHCI molecules that inhibit NK cell activation receptor function, providing a basis for
understanding the missing-self hypothesis. However, some predictions of the missing-self
hypothesis were not observed, such as hyper-reactive NK cells in MHCI-deficient hosts, rather
hypo-responsive NK cells were found. This can now be explained by other findings from the
applicant's laboratory that the inhibitory Ly49 receptors have a second function to license or
educate NK cells to self-MHCI, such that licensed NK cells have functionally competent
activation receptors. Meanwhile, other issues. For example, in prior studies, the applicant's lab
showed that different MHCI alleles appear to have graduated effects on Ly49 functions,
suggesting signaling strength accounts for these functions, possibly due to Ly49 affinities for
self-MHCI, in part related to the rheostat model for receptor function that has not been well
studied. Moreover, MHCI affects the repertoire of Ly49s that are expressed in a variegated
manner with more than one Ly49 per NK cell. Data from the applicant's laboratory suggest that
signaling by a self-MHCI-specific Ly49 influences expression of another Ly49 that is self-MHCI-
specific, potentially providing an explanation for how MHCI alleles affect the Ly49 repertoire.
Finally, it is not known how the Ly49s confer licensing, such as the possibility that the inhibitory
receptors may directly signal the licensing phenotype. Herein the applicant proposes to study
NK cell tolerance utilizing novel mice recently generated in his laboratory, including knockout
mice lacking all Ly49 expression on conventional NK cells and knockin mice with essentially
monoclonal expression of a single Ly49 on all NK cells. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this
proposal are to study: 1) Ly49 affinity for self-MHCI in licensing, effector inhibition and
missing-self; 2) Establishment of the Ly49 repertoire; and 3) Inhibitory Ly49 signaling. Thus,
these studies will markedly enhance our understanding of NK cell tolerance."
10786024,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) persists as a worldwide public health problem for which there is no FDA-approved
pharmacotherapy. Of clinical significance, in the US, cocaine use is increasing, alongside cocaine overdose
deaths, which have more than tripled from 2012 to 2018 [1, 2]. A gap in the literature and the primary focus of
this application, is to extend research from the dopamine system, associated with euphoria, to the
dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system, implicated in the “dark side” of addiction. This research project
utilizes a highly homologous nonhuman primate model, incorporating social behavior with intravenous drug self-
administration (SA) and positron emission tomography (PET), in drug-naive female and male monkeys. The
proposed longitudinal, within-subject study design will further our understanding of the neurobiology associated
with the vulnerability and maintenance of cocaine abuse. The initial Aim 1 of this proposal used PET imaging
with a KOR radiotracer, [11C]EKAP, to obtain baseline measures of KOR availability and assess the relationship
between KOR availability and social rank in cocaine-naïve male and female monkeys. The studies in that Aim
have been completed. Overall, the lowest receptor availability across all regions of interest were observed in
dominant females and subordinate males; based on previous studies, the two most vulnerable phenotypes to
cocaine reinforcement. The baseline assessment of KOR measures allows the ability to assess the relationship
between receptor availability and vulnerability of cocaine abuse (Aim 1), as well as how those measures change
following chronic cocaine self-administration (Aim 2). In addition, the studies in Aim 3 will assess clinically
relevant factors associated with withdrawal/abstinence and assess the neural plasticity of KOR system following
protracted abstinence. The use of PET as a biomarker related to vulnerability and treatment outcome may
provide evidence for a personalized medicine approach to treating CUD."
10786025,"As treatment outcomes of primary or systemic cancer sites improve, the clinical importance of brain metastasis
(BM) is growing. Twenty-four to 45 percent of all cancer patients develop BM, the majority from lung, breast or
melanoma primary cancers, but few patients with BM live longer than a year, and BM constitutes 20% of
annual cancer deaths. Ironically, recent advancement in chemotherapy has further increased the incidence of
BM because most therapeutic agents cannot effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tumor
cells find the brain as a sanctuary. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to have a deeper understanding of
mechanisms that promote BM growth, which could be specifically leveraged to overcome current limitations in
therapy.
 As opposed to the molecular mechanisms involving cancer cell–host interactions shared by multiple cancer
types that result in organ specific metastasis, a highly distinct set of structural, anatomic, physiologic and
molecular factors regulate metastasis to the brain. Astrocytes, the most common glial cell comprising ~ 50% of
all human brain cells, are a well characterized perilesional component of BM and recent discoveries, including
ours, provide compelling evidence that molecular crosstalk between astrocytes and cancer cells is integral to
BM development. Although seminal findings indicate that interactions with astrocytes occur at both early and
late stages of tumor colonization process, our understanding of the reciprocal astrocyte-cancer cell crosstalk is
limited. In preliminary studies, we have employed our Cell-Cell Communication Explorer (CCCExplorer), a
unique computational modeling tool, in identifying the novel PCDH7-EGFR, IL6-IL6R, and CCL5-CCR5
astrocyte-tumor crosstalk signaling in regulating BM. Based on these observations and in view of the secretory
nature of glial cells, we propose here to test the hypothesis that crosstalk with astrocyte-derived secreted
factors is critical for tumor cell colonization in the brain.
 Given that an even more complicated paracrine signaling network may dynamically evolve at different
stages of BM development, and the interactions could provide both anti- and pro-metastatic stimuli to cancer
cells, we will test our hypothesis through the following aims: 1) to assess therapeutic potential of the PCDH7-
EGFR, IL6-IL6R and CCL5-CCR5 paracrine signaling in BM mouse models employing gain and loss of
function and pharmacologic approaches in syngeneic mouse and human cancer xenografts; 2) to assess the
astrocyte secreted proteins in modifying the function of BBB and microglia/macrophage in early BM; 3) to
further characterize the temporally evolved astrocyte-BM cell crosstalks in a cancer type specific fashion.
 Our study is highly innovative in that (i) this study integrates knowledge and methods from both
neuroscience and cancer to identify and characterize pro- and anti-metastatic astrocyte molecular
mechanisms, their evolution during disease progression, and their manipulation in order to provide a valuable
means of targeting astrocyte-cancer cell interactions. (ii) This study leverages powerful predictive modeling of
cell-cell communications (CCCExplorer) to investigate and delineate the complex network of tumor-astrocyte
interactions holistically in an unbiased manner. (iii) This study will address whether there is any specific
therapeutic window as to which time point during BM might represent the most effective point of modulating
and targeting the vicious astrocyte-tumor crosstalk. (iv) Given the strong response of astrocytes to BM during
the course of brain colonization, the identification of secreted molecules may represent putative biomarkers of
early diagnosis or response to therapy. (v) Data generated in this study would form an extraordinary repository
for comparative analyses between different brain disorders to interrogate common and different aspects of
astrocyte biology in different scenarios as well as to evaluate the potential new therapeutic strategies such as
drug repurposing and combinations. The outcome of our study will provide a paradigm shift in current
understanding of the pathology of BM, while achieving a significant impact on future treatments for this
devastating disease."
10783344,"ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects tens of thousands of Americans. Therapeutic options for ALS patients remain severely limited, but for the ~15% of ALS patients with a disease-causing mutation, gene-based therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), provide a direct means to engineer a product that specifically targets the molecular mechanism underlying a patient’s ALS and are therefore an important enabling technology for the advancement of individualized therapies. The ability to target the disease gene or its encoded messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has opened new opportunities for therapy development. Industry-sponsored efforts focused on ALS caused by mutations in C9orf72, SOD1 and FUS offer hope to ALS patients and families with these relatively common, genetic forms of the disease. Silence ALS is a partnership between Columbia University and the n-Lorem Foundation that aims to extend these gene-based therapeutic strategies to ALS patients with ultra-rare mutations, expanding access to this powerful technology through a non-profit, precision medicine approach. With support from the NINDS URGenT Network, this initiative will focus on genetic mutations that cause ALS through a dominant mechanism amenable to ASO therapy. In a trailblazing project, Silence ALS will focus on ALS patients with rare pathogenic mutations in TARDBP, with the aim of developing a series of individualized, allele-specific ASOs targeting the mutated TDP-43 transcript. This effort builds on the first successful Silence ALS program that led to first-in-human (FIH) dosing of an ALS patient with an allele-specific TARDBP ASO in October 2022. A second project of this URGenT proposal will focus on the development of a non-allele-specific ASO targeting ultra-rare mutations in CHCHD10 associated with ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Additional projects will target mutations in other ALS genes, including KIF5A, PFN1 and ANXA11. Silence ALS will take advantage of the robust clinical and research infrastructure of the Columbia University ALS Center and the optimized ASO discovery and development platform at n-Lorem. Our program will include patient identification and clinical characterization, continuing through ASO design and screening, in vitro and in vivo testing, and GLP toxicity studies of lead candidates mandated by current FDA guidelines. In total, we expect to develop nine different ASOs targeting diverse genes and haplotypes in ultra- rare forms of ALS, through IND submission and readiness for the FIH trials. In future efforts, Silence ALS aims to follow asymptomatic carriers of ultra-rare ALS mutations and to prepare personalized ASO therapeutics for individuals at risk. Silence ALS is the first initiative of its kind, bringing a disease focus to the broader, non-profit, ASO development platform of n-Lorem. Through this URGenT proposal, we aim is to create a paradigm for other ultra-rare disease communities to follow, bringing together academic, non-profit and public stakeholders to develop antisense therapeutics for an underserved patient population, while creating knowledge, experience and efficiencies that will inform our understanding and approach across diseases and treatment modalities."
10782514,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term objective of this project is to develop a safe and broadly protective vaccine for enterotoxigenic E.
coli (ETEC), a common cause of diarrhea worldwide. This highly collaborative project will rely on the combined
resources, and innovation of investigators with complementary expertise in molecular microbiology and
microbial pathogenesis, vaccinology, immunology, and advanced state-of-the-art structural biology to
investigate novel targets for ETEC vaccine development.
Specifically, the project will:
(1) examine whether two key surface proteins of ETEC can provoke immune recall (memory) responses that
are thought to be involved in sustained protection against infection
(2) develop monoclonal antibodies from circulating immune cells obtained from blood samples following natural
infections
(3) map where these antibodies bind on the two surface proteins that we plan to use in vaccines
(4) determine the overall structure of the proteins that we plan to use in vaccines
(5) test the ability of these monoclonal antibodies to neutralize protein function and the ability of the bacteria to
deliver toxins
(6) vaccinate mice with these proteins to test protection against infection
(7) test the activity of antibodies from mice and map where antibodies from mice bind the vaccine proteins
relative to the human antibodies.
The project will answer fundamental questions about the nature of the two proteins that are relevant not only to
ETEC but to other important pathogens that secrete similar proteins. Most importantly the project is expected
to provide critical information that can be translated into efficient design of a multi-featured vaccine for ETEC
that provides broad-based long-term protection."

10756979,"Project Abstract
Treatment of biofilm-associated infections using antibiotics can be limited by pathogen antibiotic resistance, as
well as antibiotic tolerance displayed by infections. This application seeks to develop new strategies to
eliminate persistent wound infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens. Bacteriophages are natural,
abundant, and diverse with minimal toxicity, particularly when used topically, and assumed to have
negligible impact on the microbiome. Due to limited cross-resistance, bacteria displaying antibiotic resistance
tend to remain phage susceptible and phage cocktails (polyphages) can be developed to minimize resistance
to multiple phages, thereby better assuring continued susceptibility of targeted bacteria. Thus, an aggressive
mixture of bacteria- and biofilm-disrupting agents – phages and antibiotics – may
be employed towards reducing antibiotic-resisting and otherwise challenging-to-treat experimental wound
infections. Here we propose to develop bactericidal bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages)
as adjuvants to antibiotic application, with an aim towards future clinical testing while retaining current
standards of care. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected and mixed-
infected wounds. The five key phage characteristics that we developed for therapy are robust antibacterial
activity, ability to function against biofilms, host range breadth including multidrug resistant and colony variant
P. aeruginosa, limited cytotoxicity against host cells, and phage stability. Aim 1 will evaluate the phage cocktail
therapy in mono- and poly-microbial model systems. Aim 2 utilizes eco-systems biology approaches for in
vivo testing of cocktails in a complex polymicrobial infection and will investigate how phage therapy-based
targeting of a pathogen may cause changes to the wound microbiota. Overall, such therapy will be used to
reduce the burden of devastating infections caused by multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa. This study will also
lay the foundation for a program targeting each of the major ESKAPE pathogens."
10756980,"Experiencing a cool breeze or performing an intricate dance step are both realized through a precisely
calibrated somatosensory nervous system. How this calibration occurs during nervous system development
represents a long-standing question that is fundamental to understanding how we sense our environment. All
sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are derived from a single pool of neural crest
progenitor cells, which rapidly differentiate into molecularly distinct classes of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia
(DRG), each sensory neuron class responsible for detecting distinct environmental modalities. It has long been
assumed that these neurons are pre-programmed to become either nociceptor or proprioceptor, however, our
preliminary experiments suggest that final lineage choices of sensory neurons are made after encountering
neurotrophic factors derived from target tissues (i.e. skin or muscle).
 In this proposal, we seek to define how such factors contribute to a trophic signaling axis that drives cell
lineage choices. We define this signaling axis or “trophic rheostat” as a soluble target-derived neurotrophic
factor, it’s cognate receptor tyrosine kinase, and a synergistic or antagonistic TNFR family member. Our
central premise is that differences in the type and/or levels of target-derived trophic signaling drive sensory
neuron progenitors toward one of at least 13 terminal cell fates. Our goal is to define the trophic rheostats
responsible for each of these developmental choices. To address this idea, we will first map out all cell types in
the developing DRG by single cell mass cytometry, measuring at daily timepoints across embryonic and
postnatal development to produce a developmental cell atlas of the PNS (Aim1). To determine the influence of
trophic signaling rheostats on the differentiation of these cell types, we will investigate the cross-talk and
convergence of cell signaling pathways downstream of neurotrophic factor receptors and TNFR family
members in vitro (Aim2), and test how perturbing these signaling pathways in vivo influences PNS
development and sensory behavioral phenotypes (Aim3).
 To address these research aims, we are pioneering a combinatorial approach that leverages our
expertise in high dimensional single cell analysis, mouse genetics, and neurotrophic signaling, to decipher the
trophic signaling rheostats that govern cell differentiation and development in the PNS. We are well positioned
to delineate mechanisms that have eluded the field for years. This work will inform our understanding of the
development of sensory neurons, rationalizing treatments for the millions of individuals suffering from pain and
movement disorders. The mechanisms delineated in this proposal will have broad implications for our
understanding of other modalities including taste, audition, olfaction, and vision."
10756983,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The central theme of my postdoctoral fellowships has been to investigate mechanisms by which myeloid cells
are recruited and activated to promote inflammation and immunosuppression during cancer. Chronic
inflammation is a recognized hallmark of carcinogenesis and my research focus is to identify critical
inflammatory pathways for combinatorial therapeutic strategies, such that the immune system can be
harnessed for antitumor immunity. My current research focus is on pancreatic cancer, which is largely resistant
to chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), and immune checkpoint blockade. RT elicits an immunogenic cell
death whereby resident and recruited leukocytes respond to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
released by dying cells. Macrophages are central mediators of this response and recognize DAMPs via innate
adjuvant sensors, including the toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88 pathway. Specificity in this pathway is regulated
by expression of various NFB subunits that homo- or heterodimerize to drive transcriptional pathways
involved in immune activation or immune suppression. My current work is to understand how Mertk-dependent
upregulation of NFB p50 regulates macrophage immune suppression post-RT, and suppresses local
antitumor immunity by rewiring macrophage response to adjuvant signals through MyD88 signaling. This
proposal extends on these findings to test the central hypothesis that inflammasome activation in tumor-
associated macrophages restricts RT-induced antitumor CD8+ T cell responses in pancreatic cancer. As the
first step of inflammasome activation, MyD88 signaling regulates transcription of IL1 and IL18 while the
second step involves additional activation of inflammasome receptors by factors released by dying cells in
response to RT. Our preliminary data implicate inflammasome activation in macrophages as a critical
mechanism regulating immunosuppression following RT. Thus, we aim to (1) determine the functional
significance of inflammasome activation in RT-mediated tumor clearance and (2) identify inflammasome
signatures and phenotypes in macrophages responding to RT and determine whether this signature correlates
with poor outcomes in patients. Studies utilizing lineage-specific knockout mice will identify the cell types in
which inflammasome activation occurs and its functional consequences on regulating CD8+ T cell responses in
response to RT. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator studying dominant
immune mechanisms regulating cancer development and how certain aspects of innate immunity impart
barriers to effective therapeutic strategies, including both traditional cytotoxic and immune-based therapies.
During the K22 award period I plan to gain additional training to expand my skill set in bioinformatics, statistics,
lab management, and communication skills, and to develop my independent research program so that I may
establish a record of independent research project grant program funding."

This application focuses on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a blood cancer that is characterized by low
survival rates and few available targeted therapies. The five-year overall survival rate for AML is below
30 percent in adults and around 65% in children. Interestingly, one type of intervention that has been
successful for a subtype of AML (acute promyelocytic leukemia, APL) is a “differentiation” therapy,
where drugs can induce tumor cell differentiation and apoptosis. Here we present surface antigen-
guided, CRISPR/CAS9 differentiation screens in AML and study one of the most prominent hits in these
screens, the RNA binding protein (RBP) ZFP36L2. RBPs can modify RNA at multiple levels, including
splicing, processing, modification and degradation. Considering that RBPs are key regulators of gene
expression, alterations of these proteins are also implicated in several human genetic diseases,
including cancer. Our laboratory has recently presented CRISPR/CAS9 screening of RBPs in several
types of human leukemia and identified novel regulators of the spliceosome machinery in blood cancers.
Our CRISPR screens identified ZFP36L2, a member of the TIS11/TTP zinc-finger containing family of
RBPs, that also includes the ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 paralogs. We were able to show that ZFP36L2 binds
AU-rich elements on 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of a number of mRNAs that that control early
hematopoietic and myeloid differentiation. This interaction promotes target mRNA degradation and the
maintenance of an undifferentiated state. These studies showed that ZFP36L2 can bind and degrade
the two other members of the TIS11/TTP family, ZFP36 and ZFP36L1, creating a potential additional
level of post-transcriptional regulation of differentiation. Inhibition of ZFP36L2 restores mRNA stability
of targeted transcripts and triggers leukemia cells to undergo myeloid differentiation and eventual
apoptosis. Epigenomic profiling of a number of primary AML patients revealed enhancer modules
nearby ZFP36L2 that associated with distinct AML cell states, establishing a coordinated epigenetic
and post-transcriptional mechanism that shapes leukemic differentiation. In this application we initially
(Aim 1) focus on the in vivo role of ZFP36L2 in AML and identify mRNAs, direct targets that can control
AML cell differentiation and growth. In Aim 2, we study all three members of the ZFP36/TIS11 family
and study in detail their roles in hematopoiesis and myeloid leukemia."

Associate Director of Artificial Intelligence and an Associate Director of Data Science and Informatics to expand
the depth and breadth of our activities across faculty, programs, centers and schools, including the world-
renowned Whiting School of Engineering and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. Second, we will develop
new training, including in Preparedness and Public Health Communications, to address the major threat that
misinformation poses to the FDA’s regulatory success. We also propose new interchange with leading overseas
regulators, thereby enhancing global regulatory science. Finally, we will institute an External Partnerships
Initiative to serve as a force-multiplier by leveraging the remarkable scientific networks of Johns Hopkins faculty
in service of the FDA’s mission. Together, through these efforts, Johns Hopkins and the FDA will continue to
achieve remarkable gains that allow the FDA to maximize its effectiveness and impact through state-of-the-art
regulation in the 21st Century."
10933464,"The United States (U.S.) has led the world in drug discovery for over 50 years. While this is a significant
accomplishment, U.S. drugs have been almost exclusively optimized and tested in non-Hispanic European-
Americans and been minimally evaluated in men- or women-of-color. As a result, drugs that work well in non-
Hispanic European-Americans (Anglos), may have unexpected toxicity or decreased efficacy in most of the
world’s population. Disparities in U.S. drug development occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline.
Only a small number of basic scientists are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American. Initial drug development and
optimization takes place in cell lines derived from Anglos. Less than 2% of physicians conducting clinical trials
are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American6. Most clinical trials participants are Anglos. Yet, new drugs are FDA
approved for Latinos/Hispanics- and African-Americans/Africans without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable that
drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only a fraction of our citizens. In this U54 partnership we aim to
develop the resources, infrastructure, and training to mentor the next generation of researchers that reflect the
diversity of our Catchment Area. Building on our successful P20 grant, here in this U54 partnership, UCR and
CoHCCC aim to develop the collaborations, resources, and training programs to reduce disparities in drug
development throughout the entire drug development pipeline. Our goal is for this program to become a focal
point for UCR and CoHCCC to mentor and train a diverse force of cancer biologists and address the disparities
in cancer therapeutics and drug development. Already, our P20 has fostered joint R01 grants, K01 grants, and
pre-/post-doctoral fellowships. Both institutions are highly committed - CoHCCC contributed over $800K to our
P20 grant and will contribute $250K/year to ensure the success of this U54 partnership. Aim 1 will strengthen
UCR’s cancer research capacity and develop the resources to increase UCR/CoHCCC’s ability to jointly develop
therapeutic agents optimized for the diverse populations in our catchment area. Aim 2 will increase the capacity
of UCR and CoHCCC to jointly develop drugs that target disparities in survival affecting the diverse individuals
living in our Southern California communities. Aim 3 will provide the training, opportunity, and mentorship to
ensure that the next generation of therapeutic scientists and clinical trialists reflect the diversity of Southern
California."
10761749,"The goal of this study is to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning models (DLMs), to
learn a better representation of activation states of cellular signaling pathways in an individual tumor and
use such information to predict its sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome
alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling pathways, and aberrations in pathways eventually lead to
cancer development. Precision oncology aims to accurately detect and target tumor-specific aberrations, but
challenges remain. Currently, there is no well-established method to detect the activation states of signaling
pathways, and the common practice of using mutation status of a targeted gene as the indicator for
prescribing a molecularly targeted drug has limitations. To overcome such limitation, we hypothesize that, by
closely simulating the hierarchical organization of cellular signaling systems, DLMs can be used to
systematically identify major cancer signaling pathways, to detect tumor-specific aberrations in signaling
pathways, and to predict cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs.
 We will develop models that more precisely represent the state of signaling systems in cancer cells and use
such information to enhance precision oncology. I will design and apply innovative DLMs to cancer big data,
including large-scale pharmacogenomic data and cancer omics data to learn unified representation of
aberrations in signaling systems caused by driver SGAs in cancer cell, despite of their different growth
conditions, such as in cell culture, PDX and real tumor. This will enable us to transfer the models trained using
cell lines and PDXs to clinical setting (real tumors) in future. By the nature of drugs that may share common
target proteins, we develop model DLM-MLT (the combination of DLM and multi-task learning) to predict the
sensitivity of tumor samples to multiple drugs at once. Furthermore, we will develop model BioSI-DLM to use
various perturbations (ex. SGA/LINCS perturbation data) as side information to learn better representation that
potentially map latent variables in a DLM to biological entities. We hypothesize that the representation
learned from our designed models will significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the
conventional indication for drug treatment (ex. mutation state of the drug targeting protein). In summary, our
study uses deep learning based machine learning methods to learn better and concise representation
embedded in the cancer omics data to reflect the personalized genomic changes, which could be used to
guide the personalized treatment. Our study could significantly contribute to the development of cancer
ontology and promote the development of precision medicine."
10920485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this K23 proposal, I outline a comprehensive five-year training program that will prepare me for the transition
to an independent, R01 level investigator capable of developing novel, feasible, and scalable integrative
behavioral interventions to reduce psychological and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in older people with
HIV (OPWH). To achieve this goal, my training objectives are to: 1.) develop expertise in mindfulness and
behavior change for CVD risk reduction; 2.) gain experience in randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and
implementation among OPWH; and 3.) develop proficiency in inflammation biomarker research to better my
understanding of the HIV-CVD pathophysiology. In this application, I propose a significant and innovative
research strategy, an amazing interdisciplinary mentorship team, and comprehensive didactic plan to support
these goals. Background: OPWH are disproportionately impacted by CVD attributable to chronic HIV immune
dysregulation and resulting inflammation. Systemic inflammation is exacerbated by psychological distress via
activating the immune response and driving proinflammatory CVD risk behaviors. There is promising evidence
to suggest that mindfulness could be an effective intervention to reduce psychological distress and support
behaviorally- and inflammatory-mediated CVD risk reduction. Specific Aims and Research Design: I propose
to refine and synthesize mindfulness and behavior change content from evidence-based protocols
(mindfulness-based stress reduction and diabetes prevention program) to develop and pilot test a new text
message-enhanced intervention called “One Mind One Heart” (OM-OH) using feedback from semi-structured
interviews with OPWH in psychological distress (N=20), and my multidisciplinary mentorship team (Aim 1).
Next, I will explore, via an open pilot (N=5) with exit interviews and pre-post self-report assessments, the initial
acceptability of OM-OH and further refine OM-OH as needed (Aim 2). Finally, I will conduct a pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT; N=50) to a.) evaluate benchmarks of feasibility and acceptability of study methods and
refined OM-OH compared to enhanced usual care, and b.) investigate potential for effects on psychological
distress, inflammation, and behavioral CVD risk (Aim 3). Findings will provide the foundation for an R01
application to conduct an efficacy trial of OM-OH to reduce inflammatory-mediated CVD risk among OPWH.
Training and Mentorship: My training plan will be led by my co-primary mentors Drs. Conall O’Cleirigh and
Gloria Yeh, both renowned researchers focused on intervention development and clinical trials for HIV and
cardiovascular disease, respectively. I will also be supported by a.) a team of expert co-mentors and
collaborators, b.) a rich institutional environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical
School, and c.) targeted coursework, scientific meetings, seminars, and planned publications. Relevance to
NHLBI: This K23 is in line with the published research priorities of the NHLBI HIV/AIDS program to address
HIV-related cardiovascular comorbidities."
10928202,"Ventricular tachycardia (VT) causes more than half of the 170,000–450,000 sudden cardiac
deaths (SCD) that occur annually in the United States. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators
(ICDs) are the standard of care, but they are expensive (the total cost of an ICD implant
exceeds $50,000) and not curative. Patients who receive ICDs are subject to shocks to halt
episodes of VT, and those shocks can be painful and traumatic. RF ablation represents a
potential method for curing VT, at a much lower cost than ICDs, but while RF ablation has been
successful at treating atrial arrhythmias, it is not as effective at treating VT. An ablation tool
capable of treating VT has the potential to improve ICD therapy by eliminating shocks or even
the need for ICD implants, greatly reducing the cost to the health care system of treating VT
while also improving the lives of patients affected by VT. Recent advances in 3-D
reconstruction of CT or MRI images and with merging those images with electroanatomic maps
have made identification of the tissue that needs to be ablated easier. We have developed the
ablation tool that can reliably treat all VT foci.
We have developed the Durablate® Catheter and SERF ablation specifically the treatment of
VT. Our technology delivers heated saline along with RF energy and is unique in its ability to
treat the large volumes of cardiac tissue necessary to eliminate arrhythmogenic tissue located
either on the endocardial surface or deep in the ventricular wall. Our technology can treat much
larger volumes of tissue than conventional RF because saline carries the heat generated by RF
into tissue by convection. We also have fine control over the size of the ablated lesion since we
have control over the amount of saline delivered. SERF lesions can be as small or as large as
the physician needs and they will be the size the physician calls for.
We have successfully concluded a small first-in-human study whose results were recently
published in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology. An accompanying editorial
described the results as “impressive” in a patient population with “clinical characteristics that
would intimidate even the most optimistic and experienced VT ablation enthusiasts.” The FDA
has awarded our technology Breakthrough Device Designation and has approved our IDE for
our pivotal clinical trial.
We will conduct the 154-patient single-arm study at seven centers. Patients will be eligible for
the study if they have recurrent, symptomatic VT; if they have failed prior cardiac catheter VT
ablation; if the etiology of the arrhythmia is related to structural heart disease; or if a target
arrhythmia has been treated by an implanted ICD. Successful completion of this clinical trial will
result in the US clearance for the Durablate catheter and will offer an underserved patient
population a better quality of life and the possibility of a cure."
10907786,"Germinal centers (GCs) are the microstructural sites in secondary lymphoid organs, but GC structures are
impaired in AIDS patients due to the loss of supporting CD4+ T cells, leading the deficiencies in immune
responses and even inefficacies in antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected individuals. To solve this challenge,
rhesus macaques are well-established nonhuman primate models (NHPs) to study the immunopathogenesis of
HIV. However, the spatial coordination of Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), T cells, B cells, extracellular matrix
(ECM), and cytokine regulation of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)+ infected macaques and SIV-
macaques is still not clearly understood. Thus, there is a critical need to decipher the spatial and temporal
control of (1) cytokine, (2) ECM, and (3) T-B cell interactions at the single cell level in GCs for identifying the
(1) spontaneous activation and (2) SIV-infection-induced responses in the immune system of HIV/SIV disease.
To shed light on immune regulation in lymph node tissues of SIV+ and SIV- macaques and human donors, this
project will leverage spatial proteomic and transcriptional profiling to map B cell subsets and their interactions
with T cells, ECM, and cytokines in the lymph node tissues. The long-term goal is to generate single cell
insights into B cell development in GCs of SIV+ and SIV- macaques in response to spontaneous activation and
infections. The goal of this project is to define spatially resolved cellular interactions and cytokine/ECM
gradients pixel-by-pixel in fixed macaque and human tissues. The hypothesis is that (1) spatial distributions of
cell types, cytokines, and ECM of spontaneous GC activation are uniquely controlled by CD4/FDC and B cells
in NHPs compared to humans, and (2) B-cell responses are spatiotemporally regulated by CD4/FDC cells in
NHPs with and without SIV infections. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the evidence that (1) IL-
10+ cells were spatially close to viral SIV-DNA+ lymphoid cells in SIV+ tissues and (2) heterogeneous GC
activation and spatial GC organization maps in macaque and human tissues. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing two specific Aims. Aim 1 will evaluate the effect of multiplexed cytokine, ECM, and
CD4/FDC interactions with B cell subsets in SIV- macaque (n=24 each) and HIV- human tissues (n=24). Aim 2
will evaluate cytokines, ECM, CD4/FDC, and B cell maturation in lymph node tissues of SIV- and SIV+
macaques (n=24). To accomplish these Aims, spatial cell phenotyping and cytokine gene expression profiling
will be used to analyze B cell development and statistical comparisons of spatial cell neighboring features in
macaque and human tissues. This project builds an interdisciplinary team integrating experts from spatial
omics, NHP immunology and pathology, and bioinformatics. The proposed application is innovative because it
uses cutting-edge technology to study spatial proteomics and transcriptomics of lymph node tissues of
macaques and humans. This research is significant because it defines spatial GC organization to understand
why SIV+ infections induce GC defects and how it deviates from human immune responses."
10770513,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the rapid removal of harmful stimuli, either sterile or infectious; however,
uncontrolled inflammation can lead to a variety of chronic inflammatory disorders. Neutrophils constitute the
front line of the innate immune response, and swiftly undergo a carefully choreographed process to locate and
destroy potentially pathological threats. Neutrophil recruitment is an integrin-dependent, chemotaxis-directed
process that is followed by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs), together which serve to remove or kill the offending agents. To minimize collateral damage to
host tissues, however, the killing functions of neutrophils must be carefully regulated in both a temporally and
spatially controlled manner; the mechanisms at play to regulate neutrophil activation, however, remain poorly
understood. Kindlin-3, an integrin β cytoplasmic domain binding partner, and an essential integrin activator in
cells of hematopoietic origin, is known to play an important role in promoting integrin-mediated neutrophil
recruitment to the sites of inflammation. Paradoxically, however, we have recently discovered that neutrophil
kindlin-3 also acts to suppress ROS production and NET release in an integrin-binding independent manner.
Thus, kindlin-3 in neutrophils possesses both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, indicating that it may
function as a bifunctional modulator of neutrophil activation. Interestingly, our preliminary studies have
revealed that neutrophil kindlin-3 unexpectedly becomes degraded upon inflammatory challenges. Based on
these findings, we propose that degradation of neutrophil kindlin-3 is a key step in the cellular decision tree
regulating neutrophil activation under inflammatory conditions. The purpose of this application, therefore, is to
explore novel, heretofore unexplored mechanisms regulating kindlin-3 degradation and to examine its
functional significance in inflammatory responses. Two Specific Aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will
determine the mechanism by which kindlin-3 undergoes degradation in stimulated neutrophils, including both
human and mouse neutrophils. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the functional significance of kindlin-3
degradation in neutrophils in response to inflammatory challenges, such as under pathological conditions of
endotoxemia and acute lung injury. These timely and complementary studies will establish an important and
novel role for kindlin-3 in neutrophils in modulating inflammatory responses. Findings made will fill important
gaps in our understanding of neutrophil biology, and may lead to novel opportunities for developing more
specific and safer anti-inflammatory strategies for treating complications in a whole host of inflammatory
diseases, including the recently described inflammatory complications present in COVID-19."
10771004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although existing lipid-lowering therapies can now reduce low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol to very low levels, there is a significant burden of residual risk, highlighting a need for
novel non-lipid therapeutic targets. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) hold great potential for
identifying novel therapeutic targets but have largely failed to deliver on this promise in part because the causal
genes underlying GWAS loci are unknown. Through a large-scale genetic association study of protein-altering
variation we discovered a variant in the extracellular matrix gene SVEP1 that positively associated with
coronary artery disease without any effect on plasma lipids. We have now found with Mendelian
Randomization that SVEP1 protein levels are causally associated with CAD in humans. To conclusively
demonstrate that SVEP1 is the causal gene in this risk locus, we generated complementary mouse models of
Svep1 deficiency. Our preliminary data show that SVEP1 is made by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in
the atherosclerotic plaque and that depleting SVEP1 in the arterial wall decreases the development of
atherosclerosis. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that VSMC-derived SVEP1 promotes
atherosclerosis by activating integrin and Notch signaling to influence the behavior and fate of VSMCs in a cell-
autonomous manner. In this proposal, we propose the following series of experiments to test this hypothesis: in
Aim 1, we will define the cellular effects of depleting SVEP1 in the development of atherosclerosis; in Aim 2,
we will define the molecular mechanisms by which SVEP1 influences VSMC phenotypes; and in Aim 3, we will
determine if the pro-atherogenic and cellular effects of SVEP1 on VSMCs are dependent on binding to its
partner integrin α9β1. Our investigative team has developed substantial preliminary data to support all
proposed studies which are poised to reveal the mechanisms by which SVEP1 promotes atherosclerosis while
providing new insights into the pathogenesis of CAD with the potential to reveal novel therapeutic approaches."

M. Sokolsky-Papkov, (PI)
This project focuses on improving therapy of medulloblastomas. Despite aggressive and highly toxic multi-modality
therapy, 30% of the children diagnosed with medulloblastoma will still die from recurrent disease. The survivors have
increased risk for subsequent neoplasms and are often left with severe and lifelong treatment-associated cognitive and motor
deficits. Development of novel modalities that are more effective and safer than the current therapies is paramount in
improving the clinical outcomes in medulloblastomas. Cancer immunotherapy, the utilization of the patients’ own immune
system to treat cancer, has emerged as a powerful new strategy in cancer treatment. A recent study by our collaborator, Dr.
Dolores Hambardzymyan, suggested that SHH medulloblastomas are enriched in TAMs and our data shows that these
TAMs express TLR7/8. An imidazoquinoline drug resiquimod [R848], a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 8 agonist, is
evaluated as a single agent or adjuvant in combination with vaccines is several oncology clinical trials in patients with
melanoma, bladder cancer, glioma, and other malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00470379, NCT00821652,
NCT00960752, NCT01204684). However, resiquimod is nearly insoluble at neutral physiological pH, and there is no
clinically approved formulation available for its systemic or local intratumoral administration. We have loaded resiquimod
into our ultrahigh-capacity nanoparticle polymeric micelles (PMs) platform. Previously we have utilized this platform to
deliver SMO inhibitor vismodegib, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib and PIK3/AKT/mTor inhibitor Sapanisertib (INK-128).
Delivery in POx PMs reduced toxicity and rendered these agents effective, while free drugs showed no survival benefit in
G-Smo mice-genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SHH medulloblastoma. Unlike cells based or patient derived
implantable models these mice have endogenous tumors which form intact native tumor environment and blood brain barrier
(BBB). Treatment with POx-resiquimod PMs (POx-Res PMs) significantly enhanced infiltration of macrophages into the
tumors decreased tumor cells viability (pRB levels) and prolonged mice survival. This project aims to obtain mechanistic
data to evaluate the effects of POx-res PMs administered systemically (IP) and locally (IT) and determine whether the anti-
neoplastic agents that target SHH pathway can synergize with POx-res PMs to improve treatment outcomes. Specific aims
are: 1. Delineate systemic vs. local effects of POx-res PMs on the tumor immunological status, disease progression, and
therapeutic outcomes in GEMM model of SHH medulloblastoma. 2. Delineate the contributions of immune cell populations
to the therapeutic effect of POx-res PMs and 3. Determine whether the anti-neoplastic agents that target SHH pathway can
synergize with POx-res PMs to improve treatment of SHH driven medulloblastoma."
10781920,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ABCB10 is a human mitochondrial inner membrane ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter that uses energy
from ATP hydrolysis to export a substrate out of the matrix. This transporter is essential for protection against
oxidative stress during erythropoiesis (abcb10 knock-out mice die in uterus due to anemia and oxidative damage)
and protecting the heart (ABCB10 protein level is upregulated in human ischemic myocardium). Despite its
potential clinical relevance for treating anemia and protecting the heart against oxidation, the identity of
ABCB10’s substrate was unknown until our group recently identified biliverdin, a heme degradation product with
antioxidant properties, as the physiological substrate for this transporter. We have also found that zinc
mesoporphyrin, a heme analog, increases the basal ATPase activity of the transporter like substrates do.
Identification of these substrates has opened the door to the biochemical and structural studies proposed in this
project, which will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this important
transporter works. Our experimental approach involves the use of functional (ATPase assays), spectroscopic
(Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer, LRET), and mutational analysis of ABCB10 reconstituted in lipid
nanodiscs. This experimental system has many advantages for the in vitro study of ABC transporters in a “native-
like” lipid bilayer and at physiological temperature. We can produce functional human ABCB10 in bacteria,
facilitating the production of the numerous mutants needed for this research. Aim 1 will determine the
conformational changes that ABCB10 undergoes during its basal ATP hydrolysis cycle and how those molecular
movements are modified during activation by substrate. According to our preliminary data, this aim is expected
to prove that ABCB10 functions through small conformational changes. If our hypothesis is correct, our findings
will challenge the generally accepted idea that all related ABC exporters follow a similar molecular mechanism.
Aim 2 will determine substrate-transporter interactions that are critical for ABCB10’s stimulation. We will study
the protein’s ATPase activity and associated conformational changes in response to a) variations in the chemical
groups of the substrates and b) mutagenesis of residues in a putative substrate binding pocket. Our preliminary
results suggest that the substrate’s carboxyl groups and two arginines in the binding pocket are critical for
ABCB10’s stimulation. Mutagenesis of these arginines cause constitutive ABCB10 activation (gain-of-function).
Here, we expect to gain information about substrate specificity, find putative inhibitors, identify essential residues
in the binding pocket, and define conformational changes that accompany alterations in protein’s function. In
general, this project will provide molecular information that can validate current structural models in the ABC
transporters field and provide ideas to modulate ABCB10’s activity for therapeutic purposes."
10781922,"SUMMARY:
The lack of understanding how genetic variants affect molecular mechanisms that mediate TNBC aggression
and impact effective anti-tumor therapies poses a substantial obstacle to advancement in cancer therapies.
Current genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of TNBC lack genetic complexity because mice are
on a single inbred background which impairs the rigorous investigation into how individual genetic variation
might impact tumor initiation, progression, or response to therapy. Because of this limitation, pre-clinical
models typically fail to translate well to impact patient care. Although human studies have identified risk factors
for developing TNBC with both environmental and genetics approaches, studies often fall short due to the
inability to control variables or sample enough individuals. To address these limitations, we have pioneered a
transformative approach with the creation of a novel murine model with robust, reliable, and reproducible
phenotypic and genomic variation. We systematically crossed the C3(1)-Tantigen (C3Tag) GEMM, well
established to resemble human basal-like TNBC, into the BXD family - the largest and best characterized
genetic reference population. Preliminary data demonstrate that BXD-TNBC F1 isogenic hybrids have greatly
differing severity of TNBC phenotypes, indicating genetic modifiers that impact disease. The advantage of the
BXD-TNBC hybrids is that every genome is defined and reproducible. Using cutting edge systems genetics
and molecular candidate validation, we will identify genetic modifiers of TNBC. Cross-species comparisons
with publicly available human GWAS and genomic databases will identify conserved, biologically relevant, and
targetable candidates to yield highly impactful and readily translatable findings. We hypothesize that the
interaction of modifier and causal genes govern the heterogeneity of TNBC phenotypes and alter response to
therapy. Aim 1 will identify and validate novel genetic modifiers of TNBC phenotypes through unbiased
systematic quantification of TNBC severity and heritability across BXD-TNBC hybrids. Pilot studies revealed
candidate genes that impact patient survival in TNBC. Aim 2 will identify and validate novel genetic modifiers of
therapeutic efficacy across BXD-TNBC hybrids. Last, the genetic contribution linking obesity and TNBC is
currently unknown which is a problem because obesity exacerbates poor BC outcomes and reduces
therapeutic efficacy in patients. Aim 3 will identify genetic modifiers of susceptibility to obesity exacerbated
TNBC. Capitalizing upon our team’s expertise, the overall objective is to interrogate this replicable genetic
resource using established successful strategies to inform on the genetics of human risk and response to
therapy. In sum, the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC presents a great unmet clinical need. The deliverables
of this novel BXD-TNBC will define susceptibility loci, candidate genes, and molecular networks that underlie
variation of multiple TNBC phenotypes. Results generated will thus be transformative with high impact, leading
to the identification of genes modifying heterogeneity and networks underlying individual differences in TNBC."
10782165,"SUMMARY: Despite being the first human polymorphisms described, ABO(H) blood group antigens and
corresponding anti-ABO(H) antibodies continue to be the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and
transplantation. Remarkably, however, the factors responsible for generating anti-ABO(H) antibodies capable of
causing a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) remain relatively unknown. Our long-term goal is to identify the
key factors responsible for the development of anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our central hypothesis is that a distinct
developmental window exists in which host innate-like B1 B cells are uniquely sensitive to stimulation by ABO
blood group decorated microbes (BG+ microbes) and that continual exposure to BG+ microbes is required for
sustained anti-blood group antibody production. As ABO(H) blood group antigens (hereafter referred to as BG)
are carbohydrate structures that, as polymorphisms, are largely confined to humans, preclinical models capable
of defining factors that influence anti-BG antibody formation have not been available. To address this, we
generated a novel preclinical model by genetic removal of the enzyme required for murine blood group B-like
antigen (murine B or Bm) synthesis, to generate blood group O-like (murine O or Om) mice. Om mice
spontaneously develop varying levels of anti-Bm antibodies, where antibodies levels correlate with their ability to
induce hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Anti-Bm antibodies eluted from Bm RBCs recognize distinct
microbiota and isolation of anti-Bm antibody reactive microbiota identified a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae that
specifically expresses the Bm antigen, suggesting a microbial influence on anti-Bm antibody formation. Consistent
with this, exposure of Om recipients with undetectable anti-Bm antibodies to Bm+ K. pneumoniae induced anti-Bm
antibodies that can cause HTRs. However, robust anti-Bm antibody formation only occurred following Bm+ K.
pneumoniae exposure within the first month of life, while sustained anti-Bm antibody formation required continual
microbial colonization. These results suggest that distinct B1 B cell populations, which are uniquely sensitive to
early developmental cues, may be responsible for anti-Bm antibody formation. Consistent with this, Bm+ K.
pneumoniae exposure increased Bm specific B1 B cells, a B cell population that undergoes unique developmental
programs early in life. The possible role of B1 B cells is not unique to this model, as ABO(H) specific B1 B cells
were likewise detected in human subjects. These results suggest that early exposure to distinct BG+ microbes
drives proliferation of antigen specific B1 B cells, which then requires ongoing microbial input later in life to
sustain antibody production. To test this, we will weld clinical correlative data with our preclinical model through
the following specific aims. Aim 1. Define the role of early BG+ microbe exposure in the development of
anti-BG antibodies. Aim 2. Define the requirement of continuous BG+ microbe exposure for ongoing
anti-BG antibody formation. Collectively, these aims will provide important insight into the development of anti-
BG antibodies and in so doing define key regulatory features that govern the development of anti-BG antibodies."
10782166,"Project 2 SUMMARY: Anti-ABO(H) antibodies, which form spontaneously within the first few months of life,
represent the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and transplantation. However, these antibodies
can vary widely between individuals, with significant differences in the levels and specificity of anti-ABO(H)
antibodies that have direct clinical consequence on ABO(H) incompatible outcomes. However, the factors that
influence this variability remain incompletely understood. Our central hypothesis is that innate immune galectins
differentially target blood group expressing microbes, which in turn shapes the specificity and hemolytic activity
of naturally occurring anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our recent results
utilizing a preclinical model of anti-ABO(H) antibody formation that demonstrates that microbes decorated with
carbohydrate blood group (BG) antigens not only drive anti-BG antibody formation, but in doing so, raise
fundamental questions regarding how BG+ individuals, who do not generate anti-BG antibodies, protect
themselves against BG+ microbes. Our results demonstrate that a series of innate immune proteins called
galectins possess the ability to specifically bind and kill BG+ microbes through engagement of the distinct
carbohydrate BG antigens that decorate the surface of these microbes, thereby protecting BG+ individuals from
these microbes. Consistent with this, inhibition of galectins in vivo results in an increase in BG+ microbes.
Surprisingly, galectin inhibition also reduces anti-BG antibody formation following exposure to BG+ microbes.
Galectins not only possess the ability to kill BG+ microbes, but also induce the release of bacterial-derived BG
decorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data demonstrate that LPS from BG+, but not BG-, microbes,
stimulates the formation of anti-BG antibodies. These results suggest that a dynamic interplay exists between
the composition of distinct BG+ microbes in an individual’s microbiota and the ability of galectins to target these
microbes, which ultimately shapes the specificity and overall levels of anti-BG antibodies, with distinct
consequences on ABO(H) incompatibility. To test this, we will leverage preclinical and clinical studies to define
the binding specificity and overall antimicrobial activity of galectins and define how these innate immune factors
shape anti-BG antibody formation through the following specific aims. Aim 1: Define the role of galectins in
shaping BG+ microbial communities. Aim 2: Define the role of galectins in shaping anti-BG antibody
repertoire, levels, and hemolytic activity. Together, these aims will define the fundamental and previously
unrecognized role of innate immune factors in shaping the most common immunological barrier to transfusion
and transplantation. In doing so, these studies hold significant promise in providing important insight into the
development of anti-BG antibodies and clinically relevant naturally occurring antibody formation in general."

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of β-cells that causes dependence on
exogenous insulin. Despite remarkable advances in diabetes device technology, less than 25% of adults with
T1D achieve the recommended HbA1c target of <7.0%. Moreover, subcutaneous delivery of insulin eliminates
the normal portal-to-peripheral insulin gradient and causes “iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia” and whole-body
insulin resistance, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. Novel therapies that improve
glycemic control and reduce insulin requirements are needed to improve outcomes in people with T1D.
 A very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (≤50 g carbohydrate/day) could reduce glycemic variability, total
daily insulin requirement, and HbA1c in people with T1D. Indeed, several case series and observational
studies of using a ketogenic diet (KD) in people with T1D have observed such benefits. However, we are not
aware of any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of KD for >7 days in people with
T1D. In addition, there are serious concerns regarding the safety and tolerability of a KD in patients with T1D,
including the potential for an increased risk of hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, dyslipidemia, insulin

conduct a two-site (Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO and Sansum Diabetes
Research Institute in Santa Barbara, CA) 26-week RCT to evaluate the clinical efficacy, metabolic function,
safety, socio-behavioral impact, acceptability and potential for dissemination of an isocaloric KD compared with
an American Diabetes Association-recommended control diet in 80 adults with T1D.
 The following specific aims will be addressed: 1) determine the clinical efficacy and cardiometabolic
effects of KD therapy in patients with T1D, including glycemic control [percent time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL
(primary outcome), percent time in 70-140 mg/dL, mean glucose, glucose variability, and HbA1c], insulin
sensitivity (determined by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure) (primary outcome), daily insulin
requirement, 24-hour serial plasma glucose, FFA, triglyceride, insulin, glucagon, and ketone body
concentrations; plasma lipid profile, hepatic de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis, body composition
(fat-free mass, fat mass, appendicular lean mass, intra-abdominal adipose tissue, and intrahepatic triglyceride
content), and selected plasma markers of inflammation; 2) assess the safety of KD therapy with respect to
hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, renal function and bone health; and 3) assess socio-behavioral factors and
implementation outcomes, including sociodemographic factors (social determinants, unmet social needs),
behavioral factors (eating behaviors, food cravings, diabetes distress and quality-of-life); and implementation
outcomes (acceptability, feasibility, practicality, cost, complexity, and adherence)."
10827523,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with a decline in the brain’s use of glucose, its most important fuel. Astrocytes play a key role in shuttling glucose from the bloodstream to where it is needed by the neuronal units of activity deeper in the brain tissue. We find evidence of a defect in a key glucose transport molecule of astrocytes in AD and in a mouse line genetically modified to reproduce some aspects of AD. This mouse line, overproducing the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), exhibits dysregulation of circulating glucose, as well as a decline in brain glucose use. These effects are correlated with poor performance in a test of spatial memory. Further mimicking human AD, the mice show these problems in the absence of obesity, hyperglycemia, disruption of appetite, changes in physical activity, pancreatic abnormality, or insulin resistance. Together, these findings inspire the hypothesis that Aβ, the levels of which begin to rise in the aging brain even without frank AD, perturbs the ability of astrocytes to bring peripheral glucose to neurons, where it is needed for the increased neurological activity associated with memory and other functions. We further propose that the product of a genetic variant of the apolipoprotein E gene known as ApoE4 contributes to the glucose deficiency, likely through its impact on gene regulation. These ideas will be tested through studies of the status and function of glucose transport proteins in the mouse model of AD. First, we will assess the relative roles of astrocytes and other cell types and inflammation in these events. We will also determine the role of ApoE, particularly that of ApoE4’s interaction with specific DNA regulatory elements, in the disruption of glucose transport. Finally, we will utilize on-campus drug-discovery resources in an attempt to reverse the glucose dysregulation pharmacologically. These studies test a novel hypothesis about a specific element of energy utilization in the AD brain and its connection to cognitive impairment. As such, the project may provide innovative strategies for therapeutic intervention.
Relevance
This project focuses on the impact made on brain energy utilization by risk factors for Alzheimer’s such as inflammation and apolipoprotien E4. Alzheimer’s involves a drop in brain glucose delivery. This study will help us understand details about how Alzheimer risk factors bring about mental deterioration, and it may identify chemical compounds that can be developed into therapeutic agents."

 The objective of Stanford's Health Services Research Training Program (HSRTP) is to develop
independent, diverse, well-trained researchers who conduct rigorous, innovative, reproducible, and
responsible health services research (HSR) with the goal of improving the U.S. healthcare system. The
program is motivated by our view that excellent HSR requires a strong grasp of core methodological skills and
the ability to apply them to important real-world problems, diversity in its practitioners and in its practice,
inter- and multidisciplinary engagement, and interaction with both traditional and emerging research
questions. We thus incorporate strong training in our core disciplinary areas of health economics, decision
science, and outcomes research and evaluation methodology; training in key foundational content areas like
health equity and social determinants of health, healthcare delivery, and healthcare systems; exposure to
cutting-edge data science and methodologies; and engagement with a range of academic and non-academic
settings. We emphasize the presence of diverse perspectives in our trainees, mentors, and research
environment. Trainees work in a rich multidisciplinary environment, frequently side-by-side with trainees
and faculty from areas like clinical medicine, economics, engineering, ethics, informatics, and law.
 Mentored research experiences are central to our program. Trainees pursue independent research in their
area(s) of interest, working with multiple mentors with complementary expertise including at least one
mentor focused on career development. The program includes 42 faculty mentors, with diverse backgrounds,
drawn from 16 departments or programs. Trainees will find opportunities to engage with experts in a wide
variety of areas, including AHRQ priority areas of quality, safety, equity, access, affordability, and value.
 Our program takes advantage of collaborations with delivery systems including Stanford Medicine and its
learning health care system, Kaiser Permanente, the Veterans Administration, and Intermountain
Healthcare; our location in Silicon Valley and connections to leading private sector settings doing health-
related research like Google, Apple and Facebook; and major investments in cutting-edge data and computing
resources to support HSR along with leading investigators in advanced computing, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, textual processing, and their application.
 The program will support 7 pre- and 3 postdoctoral trainees per year, providing 2–3 years of full-time
support for each trainee. Predoctoral trainees earn a PhD in Health Policy or a related field and postdoctoral
fellows with a professional degree (e.g., MD) commonly earn an MS in Health Policy. Postdoctoral trainees
with a research degree focus on research complemented by our core curriculum and targeted electives. Our
aim is that these trainees will strengthen the next generation of diverse HSR leaders, equipped to generate,
translate, and disseminate the evidence needed to improve health care delivery in the United States."
10771124,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Brain function demands a lot of metabolic energy, often in brief, local bursts. The ability of each brain cell’s
metabolic machinery to respond to this energy demand is crucial both for the immediate functional properties of
brain signaling and for the long-term health of the brain. Although the core metabolic pathways are shared by
all types of brain cells, we hypothesize that different brain cell types are likely to emphasize different metabolic
components in response to acute energy demand. For instance, neurons and astrocytes are thought to play
complementary metabolic roles; and neurons that fire nearly constantly, or episodically at very high rates, may
manage their metabolism differently from typically quiescent neurons. Dysfunction in metabolism can lead to
disease and neurodegeneration, and the metabolic differences between cell types may underlie the very cell-
type-specific vulnerabilities of brain cells seen in neurodegenerative diseases.
To study the distinctive, dynamic metabolic responses of specific cell types in intact tissue, rather than cell
culture, we will perform physiological experiments on acute brain slices from mice, using neuronal stimulation,
13C metabolic labeling, and metabolic inhibitors. We will then use mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to
quantitatively map the levels of numerous metabolites in thin sections from those brain slices. Fast thermal
preservation (flash heating and freezing) of the brain slices at specific times after stimulation or application of
13C-labeled metabolites allows us to measure a fine time course of metabolic changes, and the imaging capability
allows us to obtain metabolic measurements from specific cell types. Dentate granule cell (DGC) metabolic
behavior will be isolated by MSI of the compact granule cell layer of the hippocampus; the metabolic signals from
single astrocytes and fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons will be isolated using cell-type specific
signatures, based on correspondence with labeling by established antibodies.
We will use these methods to construct a rich picture of how these individual cell types use their core metabolic
pathways (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle), both at baseline and dynamically in response to
neuronal stimulation. We will test the specific hypotheses that in DGCs, neuronal glycolysis is upregulated after
stimulation, and that the pentose phosphate pathway then becomes engaged. Experiments using fuel molecules
with different stable isotope labels will reveal how neurons and astrocytes flexibly utilize a mixture of energy
sources. By combining data on metabolite levels with data on the activity of individual metabolic pathways, we
can learn not only what the metabolic changes are, but also the positions along each pathway at which key
regulatory changes occur. And we will test the hypothesis that DGCs, astrocytes, and fast-spiking interneurons
use their core metabolic pathways distinctively in response to neuronal stimulation.
This project will reveal the distinctive metabolism of different cell types in healthy brain tissue and lay a foundation
for future work on how metabolism may go awry (as is suspected) in aging or in neurodegenerative disease."

Periodontal disease is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease affecting up to 42% of adults in the US
over the age of 30. Periodontal disease is orchestrated by various microorganisms that make up the subgingival
microbiota. In susceptible individuals, dysbiosis of the subgingival microbiota promotes a dysregulated
inflammation that causes an irreversible destruction of the soft and hard tissues supporting the teeth.
Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is an oral bacterium commonly associated with the microbial dysbiosis leading
to periodontal disease. Pg is referred to as a pathobiont because its known to manipulate the host inflammatory
milieu to facilitate disease states, however Pg can also remain in the oral cavity during healthy states. The
various mechanisms behind how Pg contributes to the changing inflammatory milieu is yet to be
identified.
Our lab has discovered Pg sphingolipids (SLs) limit host inflammation and host cell SL transfer via outer
membrane vesicles is a potential transport mechanism for Pg. The mechanism of OMV uptake by host cells is
known to impact elicited inflammation and OMV composition (SL+ or SL-) plays an important role in the route for
OMV uptake. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is also known to be involved in the innate immune sensing
of Pg OMVs and has been found to be a target for immunomodulation by Pg. I hypothesize Pg SLs facilitates an
OMV uptake mechanism that limits inflammation and that SLs promote an immunomodulatory mechanism linked
to targeting of MyD88. I plan to use the THP-1 human cell line and primary human macrophages to characterize
the uptake mechanism of SL-containing Pg OMVs (Aim 1) and to determine the role of MyD88 in Pg SL-mediated
immunomodulation (Aim 2)."

This proposal aims to identify the role of the histone lysine methyltransferase Dot1L in neuronal function and its
contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). NDDs include a spectrum of highly prevalent conditions
that manifest during development that can cause intellectual disability, developmental delays, and autism
spectrum disorder. Recent work demonstrated that many chromatin regulators are mutated in NDDs, including
the histone methyltransferase Dot1L. Dot1L methylates histone 3 of lysine 79 (H3K79me) which is associated
with active transcription. We found that H3K79me is highly abundant and dynamically regulated in postmitotic
neurons. Our preliminary data also indicate that H3K79me is critical for neuronal function. We found that patient
mutations result in a loss of Dot1L methyltransferase activity indicating that depletion of H3K79me can cause
NDDs. Further, we found that Dot1L depletion alters transcription of synaptic genes and bidirectionally regulates
GluA2, an AMPA receptor subunit. Finally, we found long-term memory deficits in Dot1L conditional knockout
(cKO) mice. However, the role of Dot1L in neuronal function and cognition remain unclear. I hypothesize that
Dot1L regulates synaptic gene expression and that partial Dot1L loss disrupts this regulation leading to NDDs.
In Aim 1, I will define chromatin and transcriptional disruptions caused by partial Dot1L loss using a heterozygous
Dot1L cKO mouse model coupled with H3K79me2 cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) and
RNA-sequencing. In Aim 2, I will examine the impact of partial Dot1L loss on neuronal function and cognition by
using the heterozygous Dot1L cKO mouse model and controls to perform electrophysiology and behavioral
experiments. Cumulatively, this work will establish a role for Dot1L in neuronal function and NDDs and more
broadly will contribute to understanding of the role of chromatin regulators in brain function."

Normal development of the mammalian enteric nervous system requires migration of neural crest cells into and
along the developing intestine. Perturbations of ENS development can result in changes in enteric ganglia that
result in patient phenotypes such as gastroesophageal reflux, chronic pseudo-obstruction, and Hirschsprung’s
disease (HSCR). HSCR is a complex genetic developmental disorder characterized by aganglionosis, the
absence of enteric neurons in varying lengths, along the distal bowel. The genetic architecture of HSCR is not
completely understood, with identified mutations documented in ~70% of patients. The transcription factor Sox10
is one gene that can be altered in HSCR. Our group has previously shown that the Sox10Dom mouse model of
HSCR recapitulates the variable expressivity and penetrance of aganglionosis seen in patients. In addition, we
have shown that postnatal Sox10Dom mice have altered ratios of enteric neuron types. This is an intriguing finding
since Sox10 is not expressed in enteric neurons, although it is expressed in enteric neuronal progenitors (ENPs).
This suggests that Sox10 could be regulating the differentiation process into the normal range of neuronal type
proportions through an indirect mechanism. In other neural crest derived lineages, SOX10 interacts with
chromatin remodeler proteins to control cell fate. Based on the lack of Sox10 expression in enteric neurons and
SOX10’s participation in altering chromatin in other tissues, I hypothesize that Sox10 has a role in altering
chromatin accessibility in the developing ENS. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following aims:
Aim 1 will define effects of a Sox10 mutant allele on genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression
during mouse ENS neurogenesis. In this study, I will combine single nucleus RNA and ATAC-sequencing in
ENPs. By comparing these data between wild-type and Sox10Dom ENPs, I will evaluate chromatin accessibility
changes linked with gene expression downstream of a defective Sox10 isoform. These experiments will clarify
Sox10’s role in the differentiation of ENPs towards neuronal fates. Aim 2 will define effects of altered Sox10
binding on chromatin modifications in mice. To determine how Sox10 mediates its indirect effect in the developing
ENS, I will assay genome-wide SOX10 binding and histone modifications in wild type and Sox10Dom ENPs. These
studies will link deficits in SOX10 binding to alternations in chromatin architecture, expanding the framework of
genes in the developing ENP gene regulatory network. These studies will also reveal effects of defective SOX10
on histone modifications and will point towards candidate genomic elements to which SOX10 directly binds.
Success of this project would identify genomic elements downstream of Sox10 that function during ENP
differentiation into normal neuronal subtype proportions. Discernment of Sox10’s influence on regulatory
genomic regions in ENPs will identify genes that are required for normal ENS development. This knowledge may
be leveraged and applied to experiments in human ENS developmental mechanisms to direct differentiation
towards neuronal fates, which may lead to cell therapies for patients with GI motility disorders such as HSCR."
10749815,"Background: The VA Community Care program has improved access to surgical care for Veterans unable to
have treatment at VA Medical Centers in a timely fashion. However, the delivery of surgical care outside the
VA poses barriers to care coordination for pain management during the transitions before and after surgery,
leading to increased risk for chronic opioid use (COU). A multidisciplinary approach to perioperative pain
management known as the Transitional Pain Service (TPS) has been shown to effectively reduce COU among
Veterans after orthopedic surgery, but it is unknown whether this approach can be delivered virtually to reduce
COU among at-risk Veterans undergoing similar procedures at non-VA hospitals.
Significance: Community Care referrals for orthopedic surgery are very common (>30,000 cases annually)
and place Veterans at risk for COU. The proposed study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate a
telehealth TPS approach to address care coordination and reduce risks for COU among Veterans when they
transition between VA and non-VA surgical care.
Innovation & Impact: No prior studies have evaluated the impact of a TPS approach to improve coordination
of pain management for Veterans undergoing major surgery at non-VA hospitals. This project presents a
unique opportunity to apply an evidence-based approach to help improve the coordination of pain management
for Veterans using Community Care for orthopedic surgery at non-VA hospitals and reduce the risk of opioid
misuse. Data from this study will be critical to support the broader dissemination of telehealth TPS across the
national VHA.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To evaluate a telehealth transitional pain service approach for preventing COU among Veterans
referred to non-VA hospitals for orthopedic surgery.
Aim 2. To identify barriers and facilitators of care coordination when Veterans undergo orthopedic surgery at
non-VA hospitals and use telehealth TPS.
Aim 3. To compare patient and payer costs with clinical outcomes among Veterans receiving telehealth
transitional pain service versus standard in-person follow-up visits for pain management.
Methodology: In Aim 1, we will randomize Veterans referred to non-VA hospitals in VISN-19 for orthopedic
joint procedures at two VAMCs to a TPS with regular follow-up telehealth visits after surgery versus only
receiving standard care for managing opioid tapering in the 90-days following hospital discharge. In Aim 2, we
will conduct interviews with VA providers and Veterans who used Community Care for orthopedic surgery to
identify factors that influence coordination of pain management. And in Aim 3, we will estimate patient and VA
perspective costs when Veterans use Community Care and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing
telehealth TPS to receiving only standard follow-up care with surgical and PCP teams for pain management.
Next Steps/Implementation: The research findings from this study will be used to evaluate and refine the
telehealth TPS approach designed to improve coordination of pain management for at-risk Veterans
undergoing orthopedic surgery at non-VA hospitals. Our study will help identify factors that influence
coordination of pain management among Veterans using Community Care and their VA providers, and
determine whether a telehealth TPS approach is cost-effective to both patients and payers. There data will
determine whether a telehealth TPS approach to coordination of pain management should be dissemination
across the VHA."

A major goal of bacterial cell biology is to understand the mechanisms underlying the assembly and growth of
the cell envelope. In addition to addressing a fundamental biological question, studies in this area have
significant consequences for human health. The envelope serves as both a major target for antibiotics and, in
the case of gram-negative bacteria, a formidable barrier that prevents drugs from reaching their target. Thus,
understanding of the mechanisms required for construction of the gram-negative envelope will help identify
new vulnerabilities in the process to target for antibiotic development. The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall layer of
the envelope is critical for cell shape and integrity. It is composed of long glycans connected by crosslinks
between attached peptides to form a net-like structure that surrounds and protects the cytoplasmic membrane
from osmotic lysis. In E. coli and many other bacilli, the processes of cell elongation and cell division are
carried out by multi-protein cell wall synthetic machines called the Rod system and the divisome, respectively.
The Rod system is organized by filaments of the actin-like protein MreB whereas the tubulin-like protein FtsZ
governs cell division. Despite years of study, the function of proteins within these machineries have remained
surprisingly ill-defined. Until recently, it has even been unclear which enzymes synthesize PG within these
complexes. Because they were the only factors known to possess PG glycan polymerase activity, the class A
penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) have traditionally been thought to fill this role. However, we changed this
view by demonstrating that SEDS (shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins in the Rod system
(RodA) and divisome (FtsW) have PG polymerase activity and work in conjunction with PG crosslinking
enzymes called class B PBPs (bPBPs) to build the cell wall. Our findings have therefore led us to propose a
new model for cell wall synthesis where SEDS-bPBP complexes form the core PG synthases of cytoskeletally
organized machineries, with RodA-PBP2 and FtsW-PBP3 comprising the Rod system and divisome synthases,
respectively. The experiments described in this proposal will build on our recent breakthrough by taking
advantage of a newly developed genetic system for the isolation of mutants encoding inactive or hyperactive
Rod systems. Several mutants isolated provide a foundation for defining how RodA polymerase activity is
regulated within the Rod system and coupled with the crosslinking activity of PBP2. Additional genetic
analyses will also be initiated aimed at defining the function of other conserved yet poorly characterized
components of the Rod system and their potential role in regulating the activity of the core RodA-PBP2
synthase. Finally, biochemical and genetic studies will be initiated to understand how the related FtsW-PBP3
synthase is regulated within the divisome. Overall, the results will significantly advance our understanding of
cell wall biogenesis by multi-protein PG synthetic machineries, and the knowledge gained will aid the discovery
of new classes of antibacterial agents that target these systems."

Approximately one person dies from heart disease every 30 seconds in the United States. About 1.5 million
Americans die from myocardial infarction each year. Clinically, genetic disorders (e.g. hereditary
hemochromatosis) and repeated blood transfusions (as required for sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia)
are known to cause Fe accumulation in the heart with iron overload cardiomyopathy being a major cause of
death. It has been recently reported that dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in up to 95% of patients with
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and that iron levels are elevated in mouse models. Furthermore, iron levels are
known to be elevated in the heart after ischemia followed by reperfusion. Nevertheless, the underlying
mechanism(s) involved in Fe associated cardiotoxicity remain unclear. Calcium and iron are both known to
play vital cellular roles in the heart. Cells exhibit a remarkable dependence on keen regulation of calcium and
iron concentrations. Cellular dysregulation of either ion can result in systolic and diastolic dysfunction and
ultimately cardiomyopathy. Loss or disruption of normal homeostasis of cellular calcium and/or cellular iron
concentrations can not only cause direct myocardial cardiotoxicity, but can also result in loss of myocardial
excitability and abnormal excitation contraction coupling. We propose that a cross talk between calcium and
iron combined results in a highly cardiotoxic cellular environment. We posit that the presence of iron can result
in cell death via an underappreciated pathway, i.e. ferroptosis in the heart resulting in cardiomyopathy as well
as ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore, we propose a similar link between myocardial stunning seen after
brief periods of ischemia reperfusion to be in part due to the same cross talk resulting in a partially reversible
reduction in myocardial systolic function. Linking the transport of calcium and iron signaling is the mitochondria
Ca uniporter (mCU) and the activation of transient receptor potential canonical channels. We show that iron
can regulate TRPC ion channel function. Our preliminary data have shown that TRPC channels are directly
activated by iron. Importantly, activation of TRPCs has been implicated in calcium paradox injury and post-
myocardial infarction remodeling. We aim to demonstrate that neither calcium nor iron are simply passive
participants in cellular processes, but when forces are joined result in systolic and diastolic failure of the heart,
cardiotoxcity, and together are predictive of a reduced lifespan in humans. We will demonstrate that it is
cellular diastolic calcium and mitochondrial calcium that defines cell death and myocardial function with iron
loading. We hypothesize that mCU accounts for mitochondrial iron overload and that an interaction (or
crosstalk) between elevated diastolic calcium and increased mitochondrial iron results in a highly volatile and
cardiotoxic environment that causes cardiac cell death via ferroptosis resulting in cardiomyopathy and
ischemia reperfusion injury. The field of ferroptosis is nascent in many regards when it comes to the heart.
The key drivers and pathways of ferroptosis in the heart differ depending on biological context. In summary,
there is a wealth of foreseeable opportunities to elucidate both the trigger(s) and pathways activated that can
result in ferroptosis and its role in various forms of cardiac cardiomyopathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Our preliminary studies have demonstrated ferroptosis in iron induced cardiomyopathy and Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy cardiomyopathy. We will use woodchucks that have been shown by us to be protected
from ischemia reperfusion injury as a tool to identify novel anti-ferroptosis pathways that can be targeted for
treatment and/or preventative therapies. We will pursue the following aims. Aim 1: Determine the role of
mCU and TRPCs in Fe induced cardiac dysfunction at the level of the isolated myocyte and in vivo.
Sub-aim 1-1: We will demonstrate in vitro and in vivo whether mCU mediated Fe uptake and Ca dysregulation
are associated with Fe induced cardiac toxicity. We will confirm mito Fe loading is mediated by mCU. The
effects of Fe treatment on mito function, oxidative stress and the role of mCU will be defined. Sub-aim 1-2: We
will demonstrate Fe induced activation of TRPCs and the relationship to cardiac dysfunction in vitro (acute) and
in vivo (Fe-CM). Sub-aim 1-3: Data derived from Sub-aims 1-1 and 1-2 will be used to populate a computer
model of E-C-M coupling and simulations run with incorporation of Fe effects. Aim 2: To determine pathways
involved in ferroptosis in Fe-CM, DMD-CM, and Woodchucks during I/R injury. Sub-aim 2-1: We will
determine whether mito Fe uptake via mCU plays a role in ferroptosis with Fe loading and test other known
inducers of ferroptosis. We will determine the role of ROS and TRPC in vitro and in vivo with Fe loading and
I/R. Sub-aim 2-2: In DMD-CM hearts, we will determine remodeling of ferroptosis-related genes and proteins,
evaluate biomarkers, and test the susceptibility to ferroptosis inducers in vitro. We will test various ferroptosis
pathways and attempt to mitigate DMD-CM by inhibiting ferroptosis in vivo. Sub-aim 2-3: We will obtain novel
insights into protective mechanism(s) in woodchucks during I/R (in vitro and in vivo)."

 The overarching goal of this application for a NHLBI-K01 Mentored Research Scientist
Development Award is to provide a training and research program that will help the candidate,
Dr. Amanda C. McClain, to develop into an independent researcher using cohorts and clinical
trials to promote nutrition and cardiovascular health equity among U.S. Hispanics/Latinos
using capital-oriented approaches. A team of experienced mentors in cardiometabolic health,
community-based and capacity-oriented interventions, epidemiology, and diet assessment
methodologies will complement and guide the candidate’s comprehensive training plan.
 Despite a large proportion exhibiting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and
experiencing food insecurity, U.S. Hispanics/Latinos demonstrate low cardiovascular mortality,
which may indicate existing capital (e.g. assets) protecting health and diet, though limited
evidence exists. Thus, this research aims to (1) identify sources of social, material, human, and
cultural capital associated with food security (FS) and healthier diet quality among low-income
U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults, and the relationship of these combined sources with CVD risk
markers; (2) develop a pilot intervention, using findings from Aim 1 and formative qualitative
research, to improve diet quality among Hispanics/Latinos in San Diego, CA by strengthening
food- and diet-related capital and FS; and (3) evaluate the feasibility and short-term efficacy of a
pilot intervention aimed at improving diet quality through strengthening food- and diet-related
capital and FS among low-income, Hispanic/Latino adults in San Diego, CA. Data for Aim 1 will
be from two ancillary studies from the national Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
Latinos. Data for Aims 2 and 3 will be from community stakeholder organizations and low-
income, Hispanic/Latino adults recruited for formative mixed method and pilot studies in San
Diego, CA, with support from Dr. Gregory Talavera at the San Ysidro Health Center.
 In accordance with these research aims, the proposed project consists of three career
development and training areas for the candidate: (1) refine skills in advanced quantitative
analysis with multiple and diverse socioeconomic and cultural predictor variables of interest; (2)
develop and disseminate a pilot intervention, integrated into an existing community or
healthcare program; and (3) establish the candidate as a collaborative and exceptional
researcher, leader, and mentor. This K01 project will impact public health by expanding our
understanding of the role of capital and capacity-oriented approaches in promoting diet and
cardiovascular health equity among U.S. Hispanics/Latinos."

Protein misfolding underpins numerous fatal neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease. Currently there are no effective treatments for protein
misfolding diseases. Each of these disorders is linked to the accumulation of disordered aggregates, toxic pre-
amyloid oligomers, and amyloid or amyloid-like conformers. While amyloid is typically implicated in disease, the
amyloid fold has also been employed for beneficial purposes, and so regulatory pathways have evolved to
promote amyloid disassembly. Yeast have evolved to employ amyloid for specific roles. Hsp104, a conserved
hexameric AAA+ protein-remodeling factor from yeast, solubilizes disordered aggregates and amyloid but has
only limited activity against human neurodegenerative disease proteins. While Hsp104 only has limited ability to
rescue proteins that aggregate in human cells, it can be re-engineered to solubilize disease-associated
aggregates and amyloid. Numerous potentiated Hsp104 variants have been discovered that harbor mutations to
both conservative and non-conservative residues throughout the middle domain of Hsp104. Application of
Hsp104 variants in animal models has been stalled due to the toxicity of Hsp104 variants in neurons. In pilot
studies, I have developed new screening approaches to isolate two Hsp104 variants that rescue the toxicity of
proteins implicated in ALS and PD without conferring off-target effects. In addition, I have developed and
employed new selection strategies to isolate Hsp104 variants with improved properties. My next steps are to
comprehensively survey the collection of these variants to determine the correlation between potentiation and
the selection trends from our screens. I will also employ computational approaches to better understand the
basis for Hsp104 potentiation. Finally, I will establish techniques that enable high-throughput analysis of large
libraries of Hsp104 variants to better understand the mechanism of Hsp104 and the basis for Hsp104 substrate-
specificity. I will then assess the therapeutic potential of top variants in an α-syn FRET biosensor cell line of
HEK293T cells and a primary neuron model of α-syn aggregation. Specifically, I will address two aims: 1)
Engineer and evolve substrate-specific Hsp104 variants and 2) Assess the efficacy of newly developed Hsp104
variants in mammalian cells. Ultimately, we anticipate that finely-tuned protein disaggregases could be
developed to reverse the misfolding of proteins that underpin diverse protein-misfolding disorders and could
simultaneously counter both a loss or gain of function mechanism. Regardless of the therapeutic potential of
these variants, they will serve as useful probes for testing what happens when misfolding is reversed, helping to
delineate the therapeutic goals for targeting these disorders."

The brain is the most vascularized organ in the mammalian body, with its complex network of
blood vessels interacting with neurons and glia in multicellular complexes termed neurovascular
units. Growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins coordinately regulate adhesion
and signaling between neural cells and vascular cells to promote normal brain development and
physiology. These events are deregulated in many brain pathologies, including developmental
disorders such as germinal matrix hemorrhage and age-related neurocognitive deficits such as
Vascular Dementia. We understand surprisingly little about mechanisms that regulate normal
neural-vascular cell contact and communication or how these events go awry during disease
pathogenesis. Here, we will analyze roles for ECM proteins and their integrin receptors in
neurovascular biology and disease. Integrins are a-b heterodimeric proteins that link ECM
ligands to the cytoskeleton and control intracellular signaling cascades. While a great deal is
known about adhesion and signaling functions for most integrins, the pathways controlled by
integrin avb8, which was discovered more than 25 years ago, remain largely unexplored. avb8
is expressed in glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and plays critical roles in
regulating vascular endothelial cell behaviors via activation of ECM-bound latent-transforming
growth factor b (TGFb) protein ligands. In this renewal project, we will develop genetically
engineered mouse models and primary cell culture systems to analyze avb8 integrin-mediated
adhesion and signaling pathways in neurovascular unit pathophysiology. First, we will
characterize a newly developed knock-in mouse model that enables dissection of avb8 integrin
extracellular adhesion from intracellular signaling in neural-vascular cell contact and
communication. In particular, we will study integrin-dependent blood vessel morphogenesis and
endothelial barrier formation in the brain and retina. Second, we will determine functions for the
b8 cytoplasmic domain in regulating integrin inside-out activation and ECM affinity/avidity using
biochemical assays and primary cell culture models. Third, we will explore paracrine signaling
between avb8 integrin in perivascular glial cells and TGFb receptors in endothelial cells. A
particular focus will be placed on integrin-dependent regulation of the docosahexaenoic (DHA)
transporter Mfsd2a in CNS endothelial cells. Fourth, we will explore links between defective
DHA metabolism and BBB dysfunction in the progressive neurodegenerative pathologies that
develop in integrin mutant mice. In summary, experiments in this project will reveal new and
important mechanisms underlying integrin control of neurovascular development and
physiology. The mutant mouse models may also provide valuable insights into pathways
involved in the pathogenesis of vascular-related neurological diseases."
10748386,"This project aims to create a validated computational tool to predict surgical outcomes for pediatric patients with
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a common condition, affecting 2.2 million children in the USA alone. It is
characterized as upper airway obstruction during sleep, which causes disrupted sleep and leads to
developmental delay, cardiovascular complications and impaired growth. The first line of treatment for children
with OSA is to remove their tonsils and adenoids; however, these surgeries do not always cure the patient.
Another treatment, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is only tolerated by 50% of children. Therefore,
many children undergo surgical interventions aimed at soft tissue structures surrounding the airway, such as
tonsils, tongue, and soft palate, and/or the bony structures of the face. However, the success rates of these
surgeries, measured as a reduction in the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (obstructive events per hour of
sleep), is surprisingly low. Therefore, there is a clear need for a tool to improve the efficacy of these surgeries
and predict which of the various surgical options is going to benefit each individual patient most effectively.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of respiratory airflow in the upper airways can provide this
predictive tool, allowing the effects of various surgical options to be compared virtually and the option most likely
to improve the patient’s condition to be chosen. Previous CFD simulations have been unable to provide
information about OSA as they were based on rigid geometries, or did not include neuromuscular motion, a key
component in OSA. This project uses real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide the anatomy and
motion of the airway to the CFD simulation, meaning that the exact in vivo motion is modeled for the first time.
Furthermore, since the modeling is based on MRI, a modality which does not use ionizing radiation, it is suitable
for longitudinal assessment of patients before and after surgical procedures. In vivo validation of these models
will be achieved for the first time through comparison of CFD-based airflow velocity fields with those generated
by phase-contrast MRI of inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas.
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital is a world leader in the fields of pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine and
radiology, and is the ideal environment to conduct the proposed research and for the PI to develop the essential
skills to have a successful career as an independent investigator. The PI has identified primary mentors in both
technical and clinical fields, and a further mentoring team to assist with specific aspects of this project. Between
them, they have experience in MRI, sleep medicine, pulmonary medicine, CFD modeling, airway surgery,
radiology, and biostatistics, as well as career development through this award mechanism. Their knowledge
strengthens and complements the PI’s background in computational modeling of the airways and airflow within.
The successful award of this project would afford the PI the opportunity to establish himself as a world leader in
airway biomechanics and to improve the quality of life for pediatric patients with OSA."
10913373,"Methods for bond construction enabling the synthesis of complex molecular scaffold are of key interest to the
pharmaceutical industry. To this end, Ni catalysis has emerged as a versatile tool for the construction of C(sp2)–
C(sp2), C(sp3)–C(sp2), and C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds. The success of Ni in accomplishing these transformations lies
in the ability of Ni to engage in both single- and two-electron processes – cycling through 0, I, II, and III oxidation
states. As a result, in addition to canonical two-electron processes (migratory insertion, b-hydride elimination,
etc.), fundamental steps such as abstractions, radical captures, and electron transfers are often encountered in
Ni catalysis. Ni catalysis has also served as a fruitful platform for the integration of photochemistry in transition-
metal catalysis. Recently, our group found that upon irradiation with light, aryl NiII(bpy) complexes can undergo
excited-state bond homolysis to generate C(sp2) radicals. These initial stoichiometric studies demonstrate that
light energy can be selectively directed to Ni to generate highly reactive intermediates from feedstock chemical
precursors. We propose leveraging photoelimination from NiII as a general step to be employed in Ni catalysis.
Traditional development of cross-coupling reactions focuses around achieving new outcomes from sequences
of known fundamental processes. This proposal is unique as it is based on the development of a new
fundamental step for Ni catalysis. Our efforts will capitalize on the interplay between single- and two- electron
processes accessible to Ni to address limitations in selectivity and reactivity in the present literature. The
research described herein will be comprised of three aims: (1) developing approaches for improving quantum
yield of excited-state Ni bond homolysis processes, (2) explore and extend the scope of organic radical centers
accessed by photoelimination, and (3) employing photoelimination as fundamental step in Ni catalysis. All three
aspects will be explored concurrently and together represent an exciting new direction in the field of first-row
transition metal catalysis."
10852939,"Abstract
Kainate receptors are members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family and are implicated in epilepsy and in
multiple neurocognitive deficits such as autism, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. These receptors can be
found to express in the presynaptic membrane where they regulate neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic
membrane where it is involved in excitatory signaling. These channels are calcium-permeable and, therefore,
activation by glutamate lead to intracellular calcium signaling and synaptic response. However, their current
activity can be modulated by protein interactions. Such interactions can lead to increase steady-state currents,
causing increase calcium permeability and differential synaptic response. Recently, presynaptic Neurexin3β and
extracellular scaffolding C1q-like protein have been revealed to create a junction with postsynaptic kainate
receptors at mossy fibers-CA3 synapses. These interactions have been found to regulate kainate receptor
recruitment at the membrane, however, their modulatory effect on kainate receptor gating properties still remains
unknown.
For my dissertation work, I propose to study how protein interaction at the extracellular domain of kainate
receptor modulate their gating properties. As part of the F99 training, I will use electrophysiology to investigate
the current modulation caused by interactions with Neurexin 3 and C1q-like protein and investigate the
conformational changes using smFRET (Aim 1). This work will give us more insight into the gating mechanisms
caused by the modulation of these proteins and help explain the role of these junctions in postsynaptic excitatory
signaling.
For my training as a post-doctoral student, I intend to continue exploring the macromolecule contacts between
these junctions using electron microscopy. Therefore, for the K00 phase of this proposal I plan to train in
performing CryoEM and CryoET experiments. Using these technologies will allow me to investigate the
connections made between these proteins in the context of these synaptic junctions (Aim 2). The information
obtained in these experiments will give us insight into the structure and organization of this junctions within the
synaptic cleft and further our understanding of the role these junctions play in synapse morphology.
Understanding this will allow us to correlate biological disruption of this junction to behavior deficits.
In summary, the objective of this proposal is to give me the training necessary to investigate the functional and
structural function of these junctions to understand their role in physiological conditions. The training proposed
under this proposal alongside my previous training will give me the framework necessary to become an
independent investigator."
10756964,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Blood pressure (BP) medications are remarkably effective in reducing adverse outcomes of uncontrolled
hypertension, and optimal adherence reduces heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction, and maintains
cognitive function. Hypertension is especially prevalent in older adults (~67%), but BP mediation benefits are
unrealized for many older adults, as nonadherence is ~50%, leading to decreased quality of life and high
health care costs ($290 billion/year in US). We developed the theory-based Multifaceted Prospective Memory
Intervention (MPMI), which significantly improved older adults' adherence to BP medications, but benefits did
not sustain, once nursing support was removed. We thus developed the Medication Education, Decision
Support, Reminding, and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) mobile application (App), which changes medication
taking from an effortful process dependent on executive functions and cognitive processes that decline with
age, to customized, cue-driven associative processes that are mostly preserved with age. MEDSReM-2 will
capitalize on technological advances to integrate additional functionalities to MEDSReM including electronic
BP monitoring and provide feedback about the relationship between medication adherence and BP. We will
test the efficacy of MEDSReM-2, and expect that the evidence-based and multi-dimensional approach will
increase perceived competence and autonomy, resulting in higher and sustained medication adherence and
improved BP levels for nonadherent older adults (≥ 65 years), who self-manage at least one hypertension
medication. The aims are: Aim 1: Advance the design of MEDSReM-2, an integrated mobile application that
provides education, decision support, reminders, and monitoring to incorporate feedback on adherence related
to BP measures. This aim will include implementing and testing new functionalities (e.g., electronic BP
monitoring, optical image capture of labels to self-start the App, expanded decision support), as well as user-
tested instructional protocols. Aim 2: Determine the efficacy and scalability of MEDSReM-2 through a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess efficacy as well as individual patterns of adherence and system
use over time. We will screen 448 older people with hypertension to identify 224 nonadherent, randomized to a
6-month intervention study. The primary outcome will be improved adherence (n=112) versus an education
control (n=112). Secondary outcomes will be BP, autonomy and competence, and mobile device proficiency.
We will examine change in adherence over time in individual participants and moderators of sustainability, and
evaluate MEDSReM-2 use patterns to assess factors related to improved adherence and BP management.
Successful completion of these aims will result in a theory-based, technology-enhanced comprehensive self-
management system that supports hypertension medication adherence and BP management for older adults.
MEDReM-2 will foster self-management, through greater personal autonomy and competence, with potential to
reduce hypertension-associated risks, save healthcare dollars, and promote independent living of older adults."
10756966,"This proposal builds on the foundation established in Haiti during three decades of NIH
research and training support to Groupe Haitien d’Etude du Sarcome et des Infections
Opportunistes (GHESKIO) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) to address the burgeoning
adolescent HIV epidemic in Haiti. The focus of this training program is to improve HIV-related
health outcomes of adolescents (10 to 19 years) and youth (20 to 24 years) in Haiti. A major
emphasis is research-training to extend adolescent HIV services from the clinic to the
community. Evidence demonstrates that providing services in the community improves access,
social acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and ultimately large-scale impact.
 This program extends graduate level training in Haiti by establishing Haiti’s first PhD
program in Public Health. We build upon an MPH program established in Haiti with prior Fogarty
support. A cadre of 8 Haitian long-term trainees will receive research training – 4 will receive
an MPH and 4 will receive a PhD – the first cohort with doctoral level public health training in
Haiti. The research training will focus on adolescent health in the areas of 1) HIV prevention, 2)
HIV treatment, 3) HIV and TB co-infection, and 4) HIV and NCDs. Trainees will be groomed to
be the future leaders of adolescent health research at GHESKIO and the Haitian Ministry of
Health. The program will also include medium-term training (6-12 months) of research staff
including psychologists (4), data managers (4), and community health workers (4) to establish
community-based research teams.
 In Haiti, 50% of all new HIV infections are in adolescents and youth, and 80% of these
are impoverished and stigmatized females. UNICEF has declared adolescents the ‘center of the
HIV epidemic’. HIV-infected adolescents and youth have poor antiretroviral treatment
outcomes with only 50% remaining in care after 1 year, compared to 90% retention among
adults. The period between 10 and 24 years is the peak incidence of TB infection and
disease. Furthermore, only 40% of HIV-infected adolescents with culture-positive TB
successfully complete therapy. Finally the rate of early onset hypertension in adolescents
and youth in Haiti is 12% - 3-fold greater than in similarly aged Black Americans.
 The development and validation of community-based approaches to identify, engage, and
retain adolescents and youth in care will lead to sustainable improvements in health outcomes
in Haiti. This program responds to the priorities of the Haitian Ministry of Health and will train the
next generation of Haitian leaders in the conduct of community-based adolescent HIV research."
10756967,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All tumors, including gliomas, need a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) in order to
proliferate indefinitely and TMMs are, therefore, considered hallmarks of cancer. Primary
glioblastomas and low-grade oligodendrogliomas use reactivation of telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) expression as their TMM while low-grade astrocytomas use the alternative
lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Due to their essential nature, TERT and ALT are
attractive therapeutic targets and, interestingly, studies indicate that TERT inhibition can lead to
resistance by induction of the ALT pathway. Our goal is to identify novel, magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable metabolic biomarkers of TERT and ALT in gliomas that will
enable non-invasive imaging of tumor burden and response to therapy. Our scientific premise
is that prior studies as well as our preliminary data, indicate that TERT and ALT are associated
with significant metabolic reprogramming, resulting in unique MRS-detectable metabolic
signatures of TMM status. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1- to identify non-invasive 1H-
and hyperpolarized 13C-MRS-based imaging biomarkers of TMM status in genetically-engineered
and patient-derived glioma cells; Aim 2- to determine the utility of 1H- and hyperpolarized 13C-
MRS for metabolic imaging of TMM status in orthotopic glioma xenografts in vivo; Aim 3: to
mechanistically validate our imaging biomarkers by identifying the molecular mechanisms by
which TERT and ALT alter metabolism in gliomas. This proposal is innovative because: 1)
although TMM have been linked to metabolic reprogramming, we are the first to propose to exploit
this link for non-invasive imaging 2) we have access to unique genetically-engineered and patient-
derived glioma models that differ in TMM status 3) we propose to use unbiased principal
component analysis to identify TMM-linked metabolic alterations and 4) we have access to and
expertise in the application of innovative, translational hyperpolarized 13C-MRS imaging methods
to brain tumors. This research is significant because the metabolic biomarkers identified here
will provide a non-invasive means of imaging TMMs, which are molecular features of brain tumors.
This will enable clinicians to distinguish tumor from regions of normal brain, edema or necrosis
and to monitor tumor recurrence and response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Identification of
imaging biomarkers tailored to TMM status will also allow detection of tumor response to novel
TMM inhibitors and the development of resistance to TMM inhibitors. Importantly, since TMMs
are a universal hallmark of cancer, our imaging biomarkers can potentially also be applied to
tumor types other than gliomas."
10764198,"Project Summary/Abstract
Osteoporosis and low bone mass (osteopenia) are estimated to affect 55 percent of the American population
over the age of 50; over 50 million people in total, with major consequences for the patients' quality of life. The
current standard treatment for osteoporosis is administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs).
However, the mechanism by which these highly-charged drugs enter, traffic through, and reach their molecular
targets and effect target cells is poorly understood. The long-term goal of this proposal is to deconstruct the
molecular pathways essential for NBP response. To do this, I will build upon preliminary genetic studies by
using cell assays and mouse models, as well as in vitro binding and functional assays to explore the
interactions between NBPs and my identified targets. Our previous work utilized two distinct high-throughput
genome-wide screens to identify over 200 genes required for the action of NBPs. In two recent manuscripts, I
have initially focused on the role of two genes, ATRAID and SLC37A3, that strongly affect the response to
NBPs, and found them likely to be required for the endocytic trafficking of these drugs. This proposal builds
upon this preliminary work to i) characterize the physiological role of ATRAID and SLC37A3 in the organismal
response to NBPs, ii) further examine their basal molecular function and how they facilitate NBP trafficking,
and iii) investigate the role of two transcription factors, associated by GWAS with changes in BMD, that when
depleted may sensitize cells to the effects of NBPs. Together, these studies generate a broader picture of the
molecular pathways that NBP uses to affect cells by investigating other genes identified in our initial screens.
While this proposal by necessity focuses on a subset of identified genes, I envision it will set the stage for my
future work determining how genes identified in our screens may predict patient response to NBPs, including
efficacy of treatment, dosage of NBPs needed, and adverse side effects. Moreover, this focus on
understanding the mechanisms of an inexpensive, commonly prescribed drug will bring new perspectives and
hypotheses to the development of treatment strategies for osteoporosis.
During the early stage of this award, I will gain valuable technical skills, including in analysis of mouse models
of osteoporosis, culture of primary bone cells, and biochemistry of protein interactions, as well as a deeper
training and immersion in bone and endocrine biology, that will altogether enable me to develop a unique
research program, which I intend to establish at a hospital-based research institute. Under the mentoring of my
formal advisory committee, I will develop important soft skills, such as presentation skills, lab leadership, and
grant writing. This combination of training, support and career mentoring will be instrumental in my transition to
independence as a tenure-track faculty member."

Flagellated kinetoplastid protozoans inflict public health hazards and economic burden predominately on
marginalized populations in the developing world. The agents of African human and animal trypanosomiasis,
Trypanosoma brucei sp., cause some of the most-studied, but least manageable and curable parasitic infections.
Failing vector control, lack of vaccines and toxic therapeutics place the onus on identification, molecular
understanding and validation of new drug targets. From the fundamental science perspective, these early
branching Excavata represent valuable models of mitochondrial RNA biology, antigenic variation, host-pathogen
interaction, post-transcriptional regulation, and other processes. Major findings in the previous funding period
position a family of RNA binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR, 35 amino acids) proteins as the central conduit
controlling mitochondrial gene expression. The unique ability of helix-turn-helix repeats to assemble into
superhelical arrays recognizing extended and compositionally diverse RNA sequences enables the essential
roles of more than 40 PPRs. Often including trypanosome-specific domains, these RNA “sequence readers”
commit otherwise non-specific modification enzymes to their substrates, or block RNA degradation and
extension. This project will elucidate the mechanisms by which nuclear-encoded PPRs govern mitochondrial
mRNA biogenesis and translation via recruiting enzymatic complexes and ribosomes to transcripts at defined
processing stages. We establish three priority areas focusing on PPRs that enable mRNA 5′ end modification,
3′ adenylation/uridylation, and translation. Building on our recent discoveries of gene-specific transcription
initiation and exonucleolytic pre-mRNA processing, we identified PPR factors acting as “protein cap,” “editing
sensor,” poly(A) binding protein, and potential translational activators. Our goal is to dissect the molecular
machinery integrating these functions and to decipher principles of RNA recognition by repeat-containing
proteins. By elucidating their RNA binding sites, structures, interactions, and outcomes of genetic alteration and
protein engineering, this program builds on our momentum in a significant field and expands the knowledge of
critical pathogen-specific processes."

Kidney inflammation contributes to chronic kidney damage, fibrosis and end-stage kidney diseases. Adaptive
immune responses are tightly regulated in kidney to prevent excessive inflammation and to maintain self-
tolerance. However, infections and medications can break self-tolerance and trigger autoimmunity.
Immunotherapy has become a standard therapy for many cancers, but it can cause autoimmune kidney
adverse events, including acute kidney injury and glomerulonephritis. Acute interstitial nephritis is the most
common immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury, characterized by immune cell infiltration in kidney.
Our group showed it affects 2-3% of the patients receiving immunotherapy, resulting in significantly increased
mortality and risk of progression to chronic kidney disease. While immunotherapy-associated acute kidney
injury responds to corticosteroids, non-specific immunosuppression also blunts the tumor immune response.
Thus, understanding the mechanisms of immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury and developing
targeted therapies that uncouple tumor- and kidney-immune response is critical to improve patient outcomes.
Our overall goal is to identify antigenic and immunological drivers of immunotherapy-associated kidney-
immune response. Kidney-associated antigens have been identified as targets of autoimmune kidney
diseases, such as in membranous nephropathy and podocytopathies. Our data support that antigen-specific T
cells also play a critical role in immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury. Immune cell phenotype and
tissue microenvironment are key determinants of inflammation: abundance of effector T cells among kidney-
infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with severe kidney inflammation, whereas regulatory T cells (Treg) are
associated with tolerance. Inflammatory tissue microenvironment and chemokines are key drivers of
lymphocyte trafficking to kidney. However, detailed mechanisms to control effector T cells, Treg and kidney
tissue microenvironment in immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury is not well understood. This project
aims to understand the roles of antigen-specific effector T cells (Aim 1), regulatory T cells (Aim 2) and kidney
tissue microenvironment (Aim 3) in immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury, using our novel mouse
model, which expresses a series of model antigens in a kidney tubule-specific manner. This unique model will
provide an ideal platform to delineate the phenotype and function of antigen-specific T cells in immunotherapy-
associated acute kidney injury. By using novel, innovative approaches to study antigen-specific immune
response in immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury, we will better understand the mechanisms of
immunotherapy-associated acute kidney injury, and will identify novel therapeutic targets for immunotherapy-
associated acute kidney injury. This project will ultimately advance our fundamental knowledge of kidney
immunobiology and bring new insights into the mechanisms of other forms of autoimmune kidney diseases."
10933546,"1 The high spatial-resolution and energy-resolution of cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) and cadmium telluride
 2 (CdTe), compared to that of scintillators, offers superior image quality in Nuclear medicine and X-ray
 3 imaging applications, i.e. SPECT, PET, CT, Bone Densitometry, Oncology, Dental imaging, Airport
 4 security, etc. CZT and CdTe remain the desired choice for room-temperature radiation detection, but it is
 5 limited by high-cost and availability resulting from low yield and long production times associated with
 6 commercial growth techniques, i.e. the Traveling Heater Method (THM). However, the application of the
 7 Accelerated Crucible Rotation Technique (ACRT) growth method developed at WSU has proven to
 8 produce industrial quality, high-performance CdTe/CZT. This recently developed growth method not only
 9 allows CdTe/CZT to be grown with the same quality as material grown by THM, but also at growth rates
10 approximately 10-20 times faster than THM. Specifically, CdTe/CZT is grown by THM at a rate of
11 approximately 1-3 mm per day, whereas CdTe/CZT growth by ACRT can be accomplished at much faster
12 rates of approximately 1-3 mm per hour. THM-grown CdTe/CZT requires a lower growth temperature for
13 high-quality devices, which results in highly off-stoichiometric melts, thereby inducing the need for
14 postprocessing. These major challenges associated with the crystal growth of CdTe/CZT have been
15 overcome using ACRT. It is proposed here to further develop the ACRT growth process by introducing
16 crystal seeding in the ACRT system for CdTe and scale this process to commercial-grade levels while
17 continuing to improve the CdTe device properties for high-flux SPECT/CT applications. Chlorine doping
18 will be further explored and optimized to achieve high resistivity and high mobility-lifetime CdTe devices.
19 Numerous CdTe:Cl ingots will be grown, and devices will be produced from these ingots (cross strip and
20 commercial pixel patterns). Devices will be sent to commercial partners and customers for validation in
21 effort to integrate into commercial imaging systems. A prototype SPECT/CT system will be designed, built,
22 and images will be collected. The medical/diagnostic imaging market is projected to cross $55.7 billion by
23 2025. Stakeholders in the medical imaging market need CdTe/CZT devices now. The fruition of this project
24 will be a significant reduction (>3x) of industrial-grade material costs by increasing the yield, reducing the
25 growth time, and eliminating post-growth anneal treatments currently used by industry. With the fast-
26 production time and high-performance of the CdTe/CZT produced in this effort, (1) the medical imaging
27 market will finally have a fast turnaround time and consistent high-performance material that can easily be
28 obtained, (2) a >3x price reduction is projected for CdTe/CZT, and (3) Stakeholders will have access to an
29 affordable, high-performance CdTe/CZT material that can be obtained for imaging instrumentation and
30 other radiation detection applications."
10761766,"The development of neural circuits involves a rich interplay between molecular cues and neural activity. This is
perhaps most well studied in the visual system, where several molecular interactions have been identified as
being critical for early establishment of coarse visual maps while both early spontaneous activity called retinal
waves prior to eye opening and visual deprivation after eye opening leads to map refinement.
We study this question in a direction-selective ganglion cells of the retina. Direction selective ganglion cells
respond strongly to an image moving in the preferred direction and weakly to an image moving in the opposite,
or null direction. Direction-selective ganglion cells are critical for driving ocular-motor reflexes that stabilize
images on the retina as we move through a visual scene as well as for sensing the movement of objects within
the visual scene. The preferred directions of direction selective ganglion cells cluster along four directions that
align along two optic flow axes, an organization we refer to as the direction selectivity map. The mechanisms
that instruct the development of this direction selectivity map are unknown.
Here we propose to use a combination of state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and
transgenic mouse strategies to determine the mechanisms that underlie the development of the direction
selectivity maps. In particular, we will determine if neural signaling, either through gap junctions or retinal waves,
play a critical role in the formation of these direction selectivity maps. Finally, we will test candidate synaptogenic
molecules identified in an RNA-seq screen that may instruct the emergence of the functional inhibitory synapses
that underlie direction selective responses."

10934589,"ABSTRACT
The detection of chromosomal aberrations is a frontline diagnostic for the spectrum of blood neoplasms.
Chromosomal aberrations, such as translocations, inversions, deletions and insertions, have been historically
identified using cytogenetic methods or more recently through application of long read sequencing or optical
mapping technologies. These methods have been less applicable in solid tumor research and diagnostics
because they require either viable cells or high-molecular weight DNA. The vast majority of solid tumor
biopsies are stored in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, a process that highly fragments
genomic DNA. In this proposal we describe a low-cost and scalable method compatible with FFPE tissue that
enables the detection of chromosomal aberration using proximity ligation sequencing.
Proximity ligation methods such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and Hi-C can be used to order and
orient segments of genomes, reconstructing end-to-end chromosome sequences. When a sequence deviates
from the expected order or orientation, such as is in the case of chromosomal aberrations, the sequence
appears as an obvious off-diagonal signal on a Hi-C heatmap, making identification of chromosomal
abnormalities an automatable process.
We propose to apply proximity ligation as a cytogenomic method to detect the breadth of chromosomal
aberrations at high resolution and low cost. This proposal outlines a path to a commercially available product
and service, which will establish a highly validated method for use in research and eventually in a diagnostic
setting. This will be accomplished by 1) designing an easy to use FFPE Hi-C protocol amenable to multiwell
plate handling, 2) building a robust automated platform to reproducibly call chromosome aberrations from Hi-C
data, and 3) proving the validity and reproducibility of these methods on real world sample. The result of these
efforts will be a new cancer cytogenetics methodology called Karyotyping by SequencingTM (KBS)."
10933477,"University of California, Riverside (UCR) has never implemented a therapeutic trial. Building therapeutic trial
capacity at UCR was our biggest challenge – and the biggest failure - of our P20 planning grant. City of Hope
Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoHCCC) runs hundreds of therapeutic trials (Phase 0 to 4) ranging from
chemoprevention to Phase 1 CAR-Tcell therapy. In our P20 planning grant, we leveraged an on-going CoHCCC
outreach trial testing, in women with insulin-resistance, testing the ability of metformin to reduce 1) production of
inflammatory cytokines and 2) circulating senescent inflammatory cells. While CoHCCC has implemented this
trial in community centers, the trial rapidly ran into problems at UCR. Key issues were 1) lack of experience of
the UCR Institutional Review Board (IRB) and 2) a need for greater mentorship of UCR investigators. In this U54
grant, we are determined to help UCR open therapeutic trials; however, first we need to build capacity. U54 Pilot
Project 1 uses state-of-the-art single cell-transcriptomics and -ATACseq in the context of a simple therapeutic
trial. This trial tests the ability of standard-of-care metformin to reduce inflammation in insulin-resistant breast
cancer survivors. Under the oversight of David Lo, M.D. Dean of Research at UCR Medical School, the trial will
be conducted at CoH using CoH patients, personnel, and IRB. CoH will provide hands-on training in 1)
therapeutic trials and 2) rigor and reproducibility of clinical biomarkers. CoH’s IRB will use this opportunity to
mentor UCR’s IRB. In Year 3, the trial will be opened for accrual at UCR. Metformin is known to reverse insulin-
resistance and remove senescent cells. In this capacity building trial – we aim to test in insulin-resistant Latina

health (reverse insulin-resistance), 2) reduce H3K9ac-chromatin opening of genes coding for
IL6/TNFα/INFβ, and 3) reduce inflammation and circulating SASP cells. Aim 1 will build UCR clinical-trials

developed during the P20 Planning period. Success of our P20 planning was due to the leadership of Dr.
Christopher Sistrunk, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoHCCC) and Dr. David Lo leader of the
U54 Center for Disparities at University of California, Riverside (UCR). Together, these investigators used
“reverse translation” to bring community engagement to the bench scientists. Traditionally, shared resource
cores support research activities by providing cutting-edge tools, facilities, and well-skilled faculty to advance
research. Yet there is often a gap in resources and knowledge on how research teams can ensure the translation
of their findings from the basic science level (the “bench”) to the community and, also, from the community to
the bench. Thus, the bidirectional potential of translational research has rarely been fully optimized. Building on
the success of our P20 and U54 UCR Center for Disparities we aim for our UCR-CoHCCC U54 partnership to
optimize the bidirectional potential of true community partnership. Community needs, as articulated by
engagement, is typically not directly obtained by bench scientists, and may explain the limited translation of
research findings to communities that are most adversely affected by cancer.1-2 Subsequently, there is a marked
lack of access and awareness of scientific data by community members and limited knowledge of community
need and context by scientists. This inadequate dissemination, lack of data access, and increasing gap between
scientists and communities, limits the impact of scientific discoveries, particularly in racial/ethnic minority
communities. Our U54 Outreach Core moves beyond traditional community engagement to foster rigorous bi-
directional, evidence-based strategies to narrow the divide. Aim 1 will facilitate the integration of the community
engagement across UCR-CoHCCC U54 research projects/pilots and cores. Aim 2 will provide technical
assistance and training to community stakeholders so they can engage UCR-CoHCCC U54-sponsored research
projects and cores. Aim 3 will facilitate the translation and dissemination of UCR-CoHCCC U54 findings to
address knowledge gaps across the cancer health disparities continuum."
10932238,"SUMMARY – OVERALL COMPONENT
The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by
the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and
nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to
train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research,
to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The
bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an
unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically,
the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including
American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican-
Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and
institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific
focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on
cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in
support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of
disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two
foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate
cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino
investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity
research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings
in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in
biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and
evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be
facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics,
Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the
Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU
have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC
provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino
population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos."
10761750,"Project Summary/Abstract
The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad array
of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes alter
the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery of such
genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by analysis of
sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental and neuro-
psychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on interpretation
of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation (CNV). Our key
targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown very little signal,
and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions. We anticipate
doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families analyzed and by
refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to resolve critical as-
pects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core features – social
deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental disorders. To discover
ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To amalgamate existing
and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new analytical methods and
analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorder risk
genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether variants in the same gene differ in
how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. With this new research
we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-
term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the
identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form
the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis
– formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare and common variation contributes additively to
risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our
opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identifying risk variants for ASD."
10761757,"Background: An estimated 181,500 veterans are incarcerated in prison or jail with thousands more arrested,
involved in courts, or on probation or parole each year. These “justice-involved Veterans” have extensive
medical and mental health disorders, housing instability, and an elevated risk for suicide and other mortality.
Since 2007, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has operated the Veterans Justice Programs (VJP) to
provide outreach, assessment, and case management for justice-involved Veterans in local courts, jails, and
prisons, and to liaise with criminal justice partners. In fiscal year 2018, VJP provided services to 80,653
Veterans. Research on the link between VJP services and Veteran outcomes is hindered by a lack of
systematic methods to assess VJP structures, processes and outcomes. VJP and Veteran-focused criminal
justice initiatives continue to implement new features without the tools needed to measure, describe, and
evaluate their components. To inform program planning and resource allocation, it is essential to know which
structures and processes are linked to better outcomes for justice-involved Veterans. This explanatory
sequential mixed methods study will develop a VJP program evaluation dashboard to determine gaps in VJP
and VHA services for justice-involved Veterans. By using this dashboard, VJP leaders can develop policies
and practices to improve healthcare, housing and mortality outcomes among justice-involved Veterans.
Significance/Impact: Given the elevated risk mental health disorders, homelessness, and mortality for justice-
involved Veterans, it is imperative that VHA provides services to address the needs of this population. This
study responds to VA priorities to deliver effective and efficient care to Veterans, Veterans Treatment Court
legislation, the Office of Research & Development priority to increase real-world impact of research, HSR&D
priorities of mental health treatment and health equity, and the VJP priority to maximize successful outcomes
among justice-involved Veterans.
Innovation: VJP is at the forefront of partnering with non-VHA criminal justice and community agencies to
serve justice-involved Veterans. This project breaks new ground by examining the full continuum of VJP/non-
VHA partnerships and drawing lessons that can be applied to Veterans who receive services outside VHA.
Specific Aims: The three aims are scientifically important and reflect extensive input from justice-involved
Veterans and VJP leaders and staff: (1) Identify Veteran, VJP, VHA facility, and criminal justice factors that
predict healthcare, housing and homeless services, and mortality outcomes for justice-involved Veterans; (2)
Qualitatively evaluate Veterans’ and other key stakeholders’ perspectives of factors that explain successful
healthcare, housing, and mortality outcomes among justice-involved Veterans; and (3) Develop a program
evaluation dashboard of VJP services, VHA resources, and criminal justice factors that impact justice-involved
Veteran outcomes.
Methodology: The current study is guided by Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations. In Aim 1, we will
conduct multi-level regression models with a random effect for facility, to examine Veterans, VJP, VHA facility,
and criminal justice factors associated with successful outcomes among justice-involved Veterans (n=80,653 in
FY18). For Aim 2, we will conduct qualitative interview with 32 justice-involved Veterans and 48 VHA and
criminal justice staff at 8 VHA facilities and partner agencies (n=80). Aim 3 will be to develop and pilot-test
(n=14) a program evaluation dashboard to identify service gaps and inform policy and practice.
Implementation/Next Steps: Results will be of immediate value to VJP, the National Center on
Homelessness Among Veterans, and VHA to prioritize and tailor health services to justice-involved Veterans to
maximize benefit and used to develop interventions to improve the health and healthcare of justice-involved
Veterans that will be evaluated in a subsequent IIR."
10850803,"Project Summary/Abstract
With the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the prevalence of severe manifestations of HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders has improved over the past few decades. However, in the context of viral
suppression, new pressing questions have emerged regarding the etiology of the persistent cognitive sequalae
in PLWH on ART. Up to 40% of individuals living with virally suppressed HIV experience cognitive impairment
and the mechanisms underlying neurologic injury in these individuals remain poorly understood. A hallmark
finding of HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), white matter injury, has primarily been evaluated
indirectly through non-specific markers of myelination on neuroimaging in PLWH or pathologic markers in
animal studies. Our team has developed an MRI sequence, myelin water imaging, to directly measure myelin
content, a component of white matter, in vivo. We will apply this novel sequence to longitudinally evaluate if
reduced myelination rates occur in young adults living with virally suppressed HIV (YLWH) compared to
demographic and antiretroviral therapy risk factor matched, HIV-uninfected controls. Additionally, we will
evaluate the independent correlation between changes in myelin content and cognitive trajectories, accounting
for social determinants of health, to determine if loss of myelin may contribute to the development of cognitive
disorders in YLWH. The premise of this application is based on our preliminary data, which demonstrate
decreased global and regional myelin content in young adults living with virally suppressed HIV compared to
age and sex matched HIV-uninfected controls and that myelin loss mediates the relationship between immune
activation and lower domain specific cognitive scores in young adults living with virally suppressed HIV. We will
combine our novel imaging methodology assessing myelin content with established imaging techniques, such
as diffusion tensor imaging, longitudinally acquired cognitive data and standardized measures of social
determinants of health to determine predictors of the latent cognitive phenotypes within our cohort of virally
suppressed YLWH using an unbiased statistical modeling approach, group-based trajectory analyses. The
information provided by our proposed study will not only improve our understanding of changes in myelin
content in YLWH in relation to cognitive outcomes, but also provide the basis for evaluating myelin water
imaging as a biomarker to identify PLWH of all ages at risk for cognitive impairment. This work may provide the
preliminary data needed to support early intervention trials of myelin preservation or remyelination therapies to
improve cognition in a broader population of PLWH."
10762401,"Calcification of the coronary arteries and aortic valve is prevalent in older adults and associated with
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and stroke. Centenarians and their offspring have a lower
burden of cardiovascular disease than their peers with usual longevity. Since cholesterol and lipid deposition
are a potent trigger for calcification, it is possible that improved release of cholesterol from cardiac tissues to
serum may be a protective mechanism in exceptionally long-lived individuals. Cholesterol efflux is the
movement of cholesterol and phospholipid out of cell membranes to lipid-poor apolipoprotein acceptors, the
first step in reverse cholesterol transport. The proposed study builds on the applicant’s previous and ongoing
work into the determinants of coronary and aortic valve calcification by leveraging the LonGenity study to relate
longevity with reduced calcification, improved cholesterol efflux capacity, and identify genetic
variants underlying these phenotypes. Specifically, this cross-sectional study is designed to add a
measurement of coronary artery and aortic valve calcification by computed tomography (CT) and cholesterol
efflux to LonGenity, a longitudinal cohort study of up to 1400 genetically homogenous older Ashkenazi Jewish
adults, of whom half are the offspring of exceptionally long-lived parents resilient to pathologic cardiovascular
aging and half are the offspring of usual-lived parents. The LonGenity cohort is ideal for this study because the
cohort is older, characterized phenotypically and genotypically, and its homogeneous population makes
detecting genetic variants more efficient. This study aims to assess the prevalence and severity of coronary
and aortic valve calcification in the offspring of exceptionally long-lived parents as compared to age and sex-
matched peers of usual-lived parents (Aim 1); the association of cholesterol efflux with cardiac calcification and
the exceptional-longevity offspring group (Aim 2); and candidate genes associated with increased cholesterol
efflux and decreased cardiac calcification (Aim 3). This study responds to the NHLBI’s strategic research
priority on pathobiology of calcification of the coronary arteries and heart valves and NIA’s focus on identifying
determinants of resiliency to disease. LonGenity has advantages for addressing whether calcification is
reduced in individuals resilient to pathologic aging who have little calcification late in life, if cholesterol efflux is
a potential protective mechanism against aortic valve calcification (in which such efflux-related proteins have
been identified), and if major candidate genes are involved in these processes. These findings could lead to
identification of key pathways that could be targeted with small molecules to protect against calcification,
offering new approaches to prevention of disorders that currently lack medical treatment. Importantly, through
a mentored research experience by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and formal training in genomics and
cardiac computed tomography, the proposed K23 award will advance the candidate’s progression to
independence as a patient-oriented researcher in molecular epidemiology and translational research."
10845651,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
HIV/AIDS remains a global epidemic, with 1.5 M infections per year globally, more than 40 years after the initial
discovery of the virus. To find new avenues for antiviral therapies, it is important to understand the molecular
and structural details of the entire process that the virus uses to enter and traffic the cell. This exploratory
project is focused on the mechanisms that the HIV-1 capsid uses to traverse the nuclear pore complex
(NPC), a critical step on its journey to the nucleus for uncoating, reverse transcription, and integration. A series
of recent publications suggest that the capsid can translocate through the NPC and that uncoating likely takes
place inside of the nucleus. This dogmatic shift came about as data showed that the NPC can, in fact,
accommodate an assembled HIV-1 capsid, while it was previously perceived to be too narrow. While it is now
established that the assembled capsid can translocate through an NPC, it is unclear what the driving
force of that process is. To address this critical knowledge gap, we propose a new conceptual framework, in
which we focus on interactions between the HIV-1 capsid and the transport barrier of the NPC, a hydrogel (or
condensate) made up of phenylalanine-glycine-repeat containing NPC components (FG-NUPs). While FG-
domains within several FG-NUPs are known to bind to the capsid, their role in capsid transport is still poorly
understood for most. As FG-NUPs assemble into liquid-like hydrogels that fill the NPC, and as each HIV-1 capsid
has >1000 potential FG-NUP interaction sites, we hypothesize that one can envision the capsid partitioning into
the hydrogel, providing a thermodynamic driving force for translocation. To reveal the mechanisms behind this
process, we propose an exploratory approach that combines biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology. In
Aim 1, we will perform a comprehensive biochemical characterization of the FG-capsid interaction. In a
qualitative assay, we will analyze the dynamic parameters that govern the interaction of the HIV-1 capsid with
all FG-Nups. Here we hypothesize that the many hundreds of FG-binding sites on an intact capsid provide the
main driving force for HIV-1 capsids to enter NPCs. An important element will be to understand whether Nup153,
at the nuclear side of the NPC, plays a distinct role in directing HIV-1 transport. In Aim 2, we will determine how
assembled HIV-1 capsid-like particle interacts with the FG-hydrogel in vitro. Preliminary data indicates that intact
~40 nm CA spheres can rapidly enter an FG-hydrogel with NPC-like properties. This system enables us to probe
the determinants that are critical for nuclear transport in a format that closely resembles the in vivo situation,
taking into account avidity effects as a result of the many dynamic interactions occurring simultaneously."
10763468,"Project Summary/Abstract: Mechanistic Assay Core #2
Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) were categorized
in the highest threat category (‘Urgent’) according to the U.S. CDC in 2019. While β-lactam antibiotics (BL) have
been used for decades to successfully treat infections by susceptible isolates of AB and KP, resistant isolates
often produce several different types of β-lactamases that can inactivate virtually every BL in monotherapy.
Moreover, efflux pumps and loss of outer membrane porin channels present additional clinically relevant
resistance mechanisms. In 2017, NIAID set forth the Gram-negative toolbox development program (RFA-AI-16-
081) to create novel approaches that generate mechanistic insights to combat these bacterial ‘superbugs’. Our
established team collectively developed a novel mechanistic assay platform as our Gram-negative toolbox
(under R01 AI136803). These assays underpin the present P01. The Mechanistic Assay Core (#2) will provide
the mechanistic foundation to rationally optimize clinically relevant combination dosage regimens of available
and new antibiotics. This core will mutually integrate all Projects and all Cores, and will provide the latest assays
for outer membrane permeability of BL and β-lactamase in inhibitors (BLI). Moreover, it will provide the latest
assays for studying the intracellular drug accumulation and washout kinetics of non-PBP-binding partner
antibiotics and for quantifying intracellular energy metabolite concentrations (e.g. ATP). The latter will be
particularly relevant for mechanistic studies to characterize non-replicating persisters (NRP), along with
automated confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (with sorting) of bacterial strains labelled with fluorescent
protein(s) to determine the rate of protein synthesis. Flow cytometry (with and without sorting) and confocal
microscopy will be used to efficiently identify PBP occupancy patterns that yield extensive morphology changes
for combinations of BL, BLI, and non-β-lactam-PBP-binders in Project #1. This approach has proven highly
beneficial in R01 AI136803. Moreover, the latest proteomic assays will provide important insights into the
expression of proteins involved in antibiotic action (e.g. PBP) and resistance (e.g. β-lactamases, efflux pumps
and outer membrane porin channels). These resistance mechanism studies will be further enhanced by whole-
genome sequencing and other molecular techniques, which are particularly relevant for evaluating the ability of
optimized dosage regimens to suppress resistance in Projects #2 and #3. For the latter projects, this Core will
provide extracellular drug concentration determinations for the in vitro hollow fiber and mouse studies. Taken
together, the Mechanistic Assay Core will provide novel mechanistic insights to support rational optimization of
combination dosage regimens in Project #1, and to prospectively validate the synergistic bacterial killing and
resistance suppression of these dosage regimens in Projects #2 & #3. Facilitated by the Administrative Core #1,
these mechanistic data will be analyzed by the Mathematical Modeling Core #3 to optimally benefit all Projects."

Recognizing the significant impact of structural racism on kidney health in minority populations, the
NIH is creating a new Consortium focused on Interventions that Address Structural Racism to Reduce
Kidney Health Disparities. The Consortium will bring together research teams from six Intervention
Sites to conduct community-engaged intervention studies to address structural racism and reduce
disparities across the spectrum of kidney health and disease. We propose to serve as the Research
Coordinating Center (RCC) for the Consortium. The Duke RCC will leverage extensive institutional
resources and expertise at Duke University to provide administrative leadership and research
coordination to ensure seamless operations of the Consortium and successful conduct of Consortium
studies; support rigorous data collection, data management, and data analysis for Consortium
studies; and foster research collaboration, capacity-building, and workforce diversification in kidney
health equity research. Three closely integrated cores will lead the core activities of the RCC. The
Administrative and Coordination Core will provide administrative, operational, and logistical support to
the Consortium, including coordinating meetings, developing a secure web-based communications
and collaboration platform, supporting program management and regulatory submissions,
administering an opportunity pool for ancillary studies, and continually evaluating and enhancing
Consortium operations. The Data Management and Analysis Core will contribute to the final design of
Consortium studies, provide data monitoring for multi-site Consortium studies, and support statistical
analysis for multi-site Consortium studies and pooled analyses of common data elements across the
Consortium. The Collaboration and Community Engagement Core will foster a vibrant and
collaborative research community within and beyond the Consortium by facilitating discussion at
Consortium meetings and workshops, supporting dissemination of Consortium results to the broader
research and lay communities, integrating selected NIH career development awardees in relevant
Consortium activities, and exposing early-career trainees from underrepresented groups to kidney-
focused structural racism scholarly work in order to successfully implement health equity research
and interventions. Together, the multidisciplinary RCC team will ensure the successful completion of
multiple intervention trials targeting disparities in kidney health and build a diverse and sustainable
community of researchers and community partners focused on improving kidney health in

10769488,"Project Summary/ Abstract UIC
At a time when new foundational scientific knowledge is rapidly increasing, there is an urgent need to continue
investing in nurturing the next generation of physician-scientists capable of generating and translating that
knowledge to the bedside care of patients. Clinician-scientists have bridged the translational gap between
fundamental new knowledge in the pathobiology of disease and advances in health care. To continue
developing a diverse pool of well-trained physician-scientists with the skills to conduct rigorous scientific
research and engage in clinical practice, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Medical Scientist Training
Program (MSTP) offers a program of combined MD and PhD training. Our dual-degree program, established in
2003, has been NIH-funded for over 15 years. The central goal of the UIC MSTP is to train the next generation
of clinician-scientists to create new knowledge and implement evidence-based medicine by incorporating
didactic, rigorous research, mentoring and career development plans. A key component of our program is the
tremendous benefit provided by the diversity of trainees and mentors, which is aligned with UIC’s long-standing
dedication and leadership in fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in all its educational programs. Thus, the
major objectives of the UIC MSTP are to provide a well-integrated training program that equips trainees from
diverse backgrounds to become leaders in medicine, to elucidate the mechanisms of disease at molecular and
cellular disease level using ‘omics’ technologies, whole animal, clinical, and translational approaches to
biomedical research. Our students will learn in an environment that addresses challenges and will be trained to
translate this new knowledge into best evidence-based care of patients. The mentors are highly successful
clinician-scientists/scientists with a proven track-record of research, mentoring, and collaboration who offer
superb inter- and multi-disciplinary training opportunities. We are highly diverse and balanced national
academic progress of excellence. Currently 102 individuals, from all over the country, are enrolled in the
program with our holistic mission-based selection process enabling us to enrolled 53% women and 22% URMs
with five-year average entering metrics of 3.7 GPA and 514 MCAT with a matriculation rate of 4% from a five-
year applicant pool average of 318. Our current MSTP students include 22 under-represented minority (URM)
and 34% disadvantaged/disabled trainees. The average time to complete a dual MD and PhD is 8.0 years and
our students have matched at the most competitive residency programs. Several important and exciting
advances have recently been implemented including design and implementation of new mentoring program
with the creation of an advising house system and pairing trainees in the final year of PhD studies with
clinician-scientists; a new Graduate Education in bioMedical Sciences (GEMS) program with thematic
interdisciplinary tracks; a diversity of research experience with increasing numbers of students pursuing non-
traditional PhDs; systematic training of mentors on core competencies; design and implementation of a
comprehensive program evaluation that creates mechanisms for continual feedback on advising, educational,
and administrative processes; and enhancing the diversity of student recruitment through a three-tiered
approach. We are confident that our program will continue to successfully train the next generation of
physician-scientists. Towards this goal, we are requesting support for 10 positions."
10770365,"SUMMARY –The highest global malaria prevalence is in Africa, where the most important vectors are members
of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, including the widespread Anopheles coluzzii. Our long-term goal is
to dissect the natural genetic differences among mosquitoes that underlie malaria transmission, including
differences in malaria susceptibility, ecological adaptation, biting behavior, and insecticide resistance. The
objective of this project is to identify the genetic and functional mechanisms of the known major genomic control
region for natural A. coluzzii susceptibility to wild P. falciparum. This locus is located in a large region of
noncoding DNA on chromosome arm 2L. Frequent alleles in the wild population at this locus strongly influence
susceptible or resistant malaria infection outcomes. The central hypothesis is that genetic polymorphism of
noncoding regulatory elements explains this locus, and therefore an important fraction of vector genetic variation
for P. falciparum infection in nature. The rationale is based on the observation that noncoding genetic
polymorphisms control >90% of phenotypic variation in animals, while protein-coding sequence polymorphism
contributes little to phenotypic variation. The most important noncoding regulatory elements, enhancers, are
responsible for the majority of phenotypic variation. Enhancers are regions ~1 kb in size that modulate target
gene expression levels independent of their distance or physical orientation to the targets. Enhancers cannot be
predicted by sequence signatures, but require functional assays for detection. In an R21 project, we used a high-
throughput functional assay to generate the first comprehensive genome-wide map of enhancers in A. coluzzii,
as well as maps of the other noncoding regulatory elements, microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (miRNAs
and lncRNAs). Our specific aims will leverage these new genomic resources to study the influence of natural
genetic variation in enhancers and other noncoding regulatory elements for malaria infection outcome: Aim 1)
Genetically resolve the major natural locus regulating wild malaria infection; Aim 2) Prioritize the candidate
noncoding and coding elements within the locus by testing correlation with infection in a wild mosquito panel;
Aim 3) Identify functional mechanisms underlying genetic control of malaria infection. This project is significant
because it will determine for the first time the genetic and functional mechanisms underlying the major genomic
control region for malaria infection of Anopheles in nature. The proposed project is innovative because the effect
of genetic variation of noncoding elements, thought to be the main source of phenotypic variation, has barely
been examined in any species, especially in malaria vector mosquitoes, and no mechanism of genetic control
over vector competence for Plasmodium in nature is currently known. The results are expected to lead to new
malaria control tools rooted in the genome and natural ecology of the vector."
10770518,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved influenza medication for children
< 12 years. Yet, oseltamivir is under prescribed, including in children at high risk for influenza complications. One
key barrier is parental and provider concern about the safety of oseltamivir. Potential adverse drug events related
to oseltamivir, especially neuropsychiatric adverse effects (NPAEs), are frequently reported in the medical liter-
ature and in the media. Oslemativir may cause NPAEs through direct effects on NDMA/GABA signaling in the
brain, which is known to cause neurospcyahitric symptoms in diseases such as schizophrenia. Oseltamivir
passively diffuses into the brain and is then rapidly exported out of the brain by the P-gp transport system. There
several mechanisms that might result in high concentrations in the brain, such as through alterations in this P-
gp transport. However, there is no consensus on a causal relationship between oseltamivir and NPAEs. This is
in part because of the background incidence of influenza associated neuropsychiatric symptoms is not known.
There is a critical need to define the true risk of NPAE in children exposed to oseltamivir to best inform clinical
practice and clarify the concerns of patients, their caregivers, and providers. The aims of this project are to: 1)
to define the population-based incidence of influenza associated serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in children,
2) to test the hypothesis that oseltamivir is associated with serious NPAE and 3) to test the hypothesis that
concurrent use of drugs modulating P-gp modifies the risk of oseltamivir associated serious NPAE. The pro-
posed studies leverage data from the Tennessee Medicaid (TennCare) program comprising vital statistics, phar-
macy claims data, and hospital administrative data from more than 750,000 children per year, representing 50%
of Tennessee’s children. The TennCare database overrespresents vulnerable children, including those with
chronic conditions and socioeconomic disadvantages. The large number of children in this database, and long
history of successful, high-impact research conducted using these data are major strengths of the current pro-
posal. The results of these studies will fill an important knowledge gap regarding serious adverse drug events in
children and will inform treatment for influenza. The candidate’s career goal is to emerge as an independent
clinical investigator with expertise in pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety. To accomplish this goal, in addition
to completion of the proposed scientific aims, the candidate will augment his prior research training with ad-
vanced coursework in pharmacoepidemiology methods, training in leadership and mentoring, and practical ex-
periences with the FDA and Children's Hospital Association focused on observational studies to improve pedi-
atric drug safety. Throughout this award, the candidate will work closely with a multidisciplinary team of mentors

“Synthesizing, Interpreting, and Extrapolating Interventions to Foster Human Development”
will support diverse scholars of early childhood development using different empirical strategies to investigate
the sources of treatment effects of successful early childhood programs and to compare the growth of skills by
age across them. It draws on a wealth of data collected on three influential programs (the Perry Preschool
Program, the Abecedarian Project, and Jamaica Reach Up and Learn) and subsequent implementations and
adaptations. Members of our team have actively designed, collected, and analyzed different subsets of these
programs evaluated by random assignment. Some programs have long-term follow-ups. This research has five
main aims: (1) Using common (across studies) dynamic analytical frameworks developed and applied in
different disciplines, we analyze longitudinal data on the growth of comparable measures of skills and
outcomes from major early childhood interventions targeted to disadvantaged children, controlling for family
and environmental conditions. We conduct mediation and moderation analyses to control for endogeneity of
intervention-induced changes in mediators and moderators. We examine the intra- and inter-generational
impacts of the interventions with long term follow up, taking participants well into their middle age (ABC) and
late middle age (Perry). These analyses adjust for attrition and non-response. We use both large sample
inferential methods and design-based small-sample randomization inference. We harmonize measures and
outcomes and require those we use to satisfy metric invariance criteria; (2) Building on our previous research,
we use empirically validated dynamic models to forecast experimental outcomes out-of-sample. We build
theoretically- and empirically-grounded tools to estimate the long-run impacts of short-run interventions that
will be available to other practitioners; (3) Update and extend cost-benefit analyses of early childhood
programs. For the first time, we incorporate impacts on adult children and siblings as well as impacts on
middle age and late middle age health and earnings of the original participants. We investigate the impact of
early childhood programs on social mobility; (4) Examine the effectiveness of home visiting programs. We
analyze the influential Jamaica Reach Up and Learn home visiting program and many programs inspired by
it. We compare child growth trajectories from these programs with those from more comprehensive omnibus
(and expensive) early childhood programs, many of which have a home visiting component. This will facilitate
isolation of the role of home visiting in promoting child development; and (5) We investigate in detail the roles
of parent (caregiver)-child, home visitor-child, and home visitor-caregiver interactions in promoting skill
development in a uniquely well-documented adaptation of Jamaica Reach Up: China REACH (10 sites). We
quantitatively assess the impact of “scaffolding” measured on a weekly basis on the growth of child skills."
10775620,"ABSTRACT
Our ability to stop and control movements is an integral part of human behavior. This behavior is disrupted in
several disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, attention deficit disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and
addiction. Previous work has often used motor inhibition tasks such as the stop signal task to study this behavior.
In this task, participants are instructed to respond to a stimuli (such as an arrow) with a button press. On most
trials the response is executed as planned. However, on a minority of trials a second stimuli – a stop signal – is
presented that indicates the participant should attempt to stop their movement. This task, combined with
neuroscientific techniques, has pointed to the importance of a network of cortical and subcortical regions.
However, the stop signal task has several limitations. First, because the stop task requires contrasting successful
stopping with trials that include a response – disentangling motoric cessation of movement from the cognitive
inhibitory component is challenging. Second, although examples of stopping in daily life often focus on stopping
ongoing movements (i.e. stopping walking when you see a car rounding the corner), the traditional stop signal
task focuses on single, discrete, movements. It is unclear if the same neural network and physiological processes
are involved in stopping continuous movements. Finally, the time it takes to stop cannot be calculated for
individual trials and instead is estimated over the entire task, complicating certain analyses/interpretations. To
address these limitations, we have designed a new task. Here participants perform a continuous movement
during a countdown. On the majority of trials, the countdown proceeds to 0 as expected and then a stop signal
appears, but on a minority of trials, the stop signal occurs early and the participant must stop a response before
they expected. In this proposal, participants will perform this novel task while their brain activity is recorded. We
will first use two different approaches to probe both cortical and subcortical activity. First, to examine cortical
activity we will record intracranial electrophysiology from epilepsy patients undergoing invasive monitoring. Then,
to examine subcortical activity (and its influence on cortex) we will record scalp EEG in a special cohort of
Parkinson’s disease patients with deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted in different subcortical nodes
(subthalamic nucleus, STN and globus pallidus interna, GPi). These patients will be tested with their stimulation
turned both on and off to examine the effect of subcortical stimulation of particular nodes on behavior and cortical
activity. Finally, we will establish the ecological validity and clinical reliability of this task by comparing behavioral
measures derived from the task to validated scales of cognition and inhibitory control in a large cohort of controls
and nicotine dependent individuals (smokers). This cohort is appropriate because models of addiction have
identified inhibitory control deficits as an important factor in addictive behavior. Overall, these experiments will
disentangle roles of cortical and subcortical nodes in stopping continuous movements and link these behaviors
to clinically validates measures."
10775068,"The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is part of the opioid neuromodulatory system that influences pain and mood
perception. KOR agonists have been recognized for their analgesia properties but are also associated with
dysphoria, limiting their potential therapeutic use. Deciphering the intracellular signaling events activated by KOR
that modulate the therapeutic and aversive effects may help aid in the development of novel compounds. KOR
is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) that is endogenously activated by opioid peptides. The balance of
heterotrimeric G protein activation and deactivation is central in dictating its cellular and behavioral responses.
Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins serve as an endogenous antagonist of GPCR signaling,
determining the extent, and timing of their signaling and may offer a way to fine tune intracellular signaling. Our
preliminary data demonstrates that the R7 RGS family modulates KOR signaling and influences KOR-mediated
behaviors. In this proposal we will characterize the role of RGS7 on KOR signaling by identifying the neuronal
population that drives KOR-mediated aversion and determine its impact of phosphorylation on KOR signaling.
In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal population that RGS7 acts to modulate KOR-mediated aversion. This aim
will utilize a well-established conditional place aversion test and novel operant task to assess responses to
aversive stimuli. Aim 2 will investigate the impact phosphorylated RGS7 has on KOR signaling and KOR-
mediated aversion. We will determine the extent to which phosphorylation affects the interaction with its binding
partner R7-binding protein (R7BP), which is required for the stability and catalytic activity of R7 RGS proteins. In
Aim 3 we will determine the contribution of G protein signaling on KOR-mediated behaviors. This proposal will
utilize a combination of transgenic mouse model as well as viral and chemogenetic approaches to target RGS
protein in a cell-specific manner and employ novel aversion behavioral tests. At the successful completion of the
proposed research, the expected outcomes are to determine the contribution of the RGS-G protein pathway
towards specific KOR-mediated behaviors and delineate the cell-specific contributions. The proposed research
is innovative as we use an operant paradigm to employ aversive stimuli that allows us to address the long-term
effects within a homecage environment. These results provide a strong basis for furthering our knowledge of
KOR signaling and to delineate the impact of RGS-G protein signaling on aversive behaviors which is expected
to have significant impact on the future therapeutic development."
10777864,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. It
is estimated that every year, over 100,000 children under 5 years of age die from RSV, half of whom are
infants <6 months of age. The burden that RSV exerts on healthcare systems cannot be overstated. In the
United States, RSV is associated with 1.5 million annual medical encounters in children less than five years
and is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants under one year of age. The pending introduction of
new immunoprophylactic agents offers unique opportunities to confront the challenge of RSV in infants. Two
products whose approval is imminent include a vaccine that is administered to pregnant women to protect their
newborns and a long-acting monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is deployed like a vaccine and routinely given to
all newborns. As is the case with any new vaccine, it will be important to conduct studies during the early
phases of implementing these new immunization strategies to answer many unanswered questions
surrounding their risks and benefits in real-world settings. To address this critical need, we propose a large-
scale case-control study that integrates data from different modalities (e.g., clinical, demographic, virologic,
immunologic) to evaluate the effectiveness of perinatal RSV immunoprophylaxis. Cases and controls will be
identified using active surveillance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical sites of the Yale New Haven Health
System, the largest and most comprehensive healthcare system in Connecticut, with 8 large hospitals and
close to 4 million outpatient encounters every year. We will enroll patients seeking health care for acute
respiratory illness and confirm RSV infection using approved molecular assays. We will use data-gathering
protocols that are both exhaustive and identical for both cases and controls and collect data from multiple
sources, including health records, interviews, immunization registries, and population-based surveys. We will
generate estimates of effectiveness for each type of immunization used, disaggregated by time from
immunization, disease severity, and sociodemographic characteristics (Aim 1). We will also perform genetic
characterization of all the study's RSV cases, monitor the virus's genetic diversity over time, and quantify the
relative effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis against various viral lineages (Aim 2). Finally, we will collect acute
and convalescent blood from a subset of infants and employ a single-cell and multi-omics approach to study
the dynamics of the innate and adaptive immune responses during RSV infection and explore the molecular
mechanisms that contribute to immunoprophylaxis failure (Aim 3). The results from this project will be critical
as it will allow policymakers to determine whether these products are sufficiently beneficial to warrant continual
inclusion in the immunization program. Further, if our results show that immunization confers considerable
protection, these data can be a potent incentive to increase the strength of recommendations by healthcare
providers and boost acceptance by patients."
10776248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In high income countries, SUDI, and its sub-categories (1) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and (2)
Accidental Suffocation Deaths (ASD), are the leading preventable causes of infant mortality. The ensuing ‘back
to sleep’ campaigns have since proven among the most effective public health strategies ever identified for
reducing infant mortality. Yet, in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) almost nothing is known about the
burden of SUDI or its modifiable risk factors, and very few African countries have policies targeting SUDI. In our
recent systematic review, we documented a near absence of research on SUDI in Africa, excepting several well-
conducted investigations from South Africa. Our focus on SUDI emerged during a multi-year postmortem infant
surveillance project to establish the fatal burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Over 3 years, we enrolled ~80%
of all infant deaths in Lusaka, Zambia, nearly 2,300 infants. Ultimately, SUDI was implicated in 7.4% of those
community deaths. Far from being rare, SUDI appeared to be a very common cause of infant demise, with
modifiable risk factors that were ubiquitous yet wholly unaddressed by existing policies in Zambia. If confirmed,
SUDI constitutes a major unmet opportunity to reduce infant mortality in Africa that has largely been ignored by
the global health community. Yet, our early data fall short of the gold standard for evaluating SUDI deaths.
Robust local prevalence data will be essential to support policy initiatives targeting SUDI and as a baseline from
which to judge the impact of such policies. Therefore, we are proposing Project Chisoni, a rigorous 5-year study
to precisely define the burden of SUDI and its modifiable risk factors in Zambia.
To achieve those broader goals, we have convened a multinational multidisciplinary team with expertise in
pediatrics, cause of death analysis, SUDI, pathology, molecular biology, and SUDI epidemiology. Our aims are:
SA1 will create a ‘gold standard’ evaluation of community infant deaths to demonstrate the burden of SUDI in
an African setting, which will include in-depth post-mortem evaluations, multiplex PCR to identify unanticipated
infectious causes of death and detailed death scene investigations to understand the context in which each death
occurred. This will generate the proportion of deaths that are due to SUDI and SUDI deaths/1000 live births.
SA2 includes three sub-aims. SA2.1 will be a matched case-control study examining the association of risk
factors with SUDI among the cases in SA1 vs. a group of contemporaneously enrolled healthy control infants;
SA2.2 takes the ORs and prevalence data from SA1 and S2.1 to calculate the population attributable fraction
(PAF) for risk factors alone or in combination, and therefore the theoretical number of lives that could be saved
through mitigation; and SA2.3 seeks to expand the generalizability of this project by conducting additional risk
factor prevalence surveys in different urban and rural settings in Zambia and several other African nations."
10771126,"The purpose of this R01 proposal is to deepen our knowledge of the primary cause of drug overdose deaths in
the U.S. today: novel psychoactive synthetic opioids, the majority of which are fentanyl analogues. Using a
nationwide registry of patients who present to emergency departments, novel fentanyl analogue overdose will
be studied in terms of its epidemiology, analytical confirmation, clinical risk factors, and treatment needs, by a
uniquely qualified multidisciplinary team with an extensive track record of collaboration in the field.
The scope of the U.S. opioid epidemic is broadening, with drug overdose deaths nearly tripling from 1999-2015. For the first time ever, in 2015 U.S. drug overdose deaths surpassed 50,000 (52,404), of which 33,091
(63.1%) involved an opioid. Overdose deaths continued to increase in 2016 to 63,600. Opioid overdoses cost
Americans $504 billion in 2015 (2.8% of gross domestic product), up from six times the prior estimates in 2013.
There was a 27% increase in nationwide Emergency Department visits for opioid overdoses last year alone.
Strategies to mitigate this trend by decreasing the availability and abuse potential of prescription opioids have
been followed by an increase in illicit opioid use. While initially the predominance of illicit opioid overdoses
were a result of heroin exposure, the changing face of global drug commerce introduced synthetic opioid
fentanyl analogues into the drug supply, where they are now estimated to have surpassed heroin as the
primary cause of drug overdose deaths.
Using nearly 70 hospital centers nationwide with bedside evaluation of patients, over 10,000 overdose patients
have been enrolled in the Principal Investigator’s prior study giving this proposal momentum and feasibility.
Our specific aims are four-fold: (1) To derive and validate clinical predictors of adverse health consequences of
fentanyl analogue overdose; (2) To confirm fentanyl analogue exposure via state-of-the-art toxicology testing;
(3) To investigate treatment utilization, duration, and disparities for fentanyl analogue overdose; and (4) To
assess epidemiology of analytically-confirmed fentanyl analogue overdose.
To achieve these Specific Aims, we will prospectively enroll a national sampling of patients. We will implement
the rapid dissemination of alerts and information to the public and public health entities on adverse effects of
fentanyl analogues. At the completion of the proposed research, the field of drug abuse will be significantly
advanced to the benefit of thousands of victims of the U.S. opioid epidemic."

We propose renewal of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) health services research (HSR) T32
training grant. UAB and our training program are situated in Alabama, in the heart of the U.S. Deep South
region with a disproportionate burden of disease, lagging health indicators, and deep-seated inequities. The
centerpiece of the UAB Center for Outcomes and Effectiveness Research and Education (COERE) training
portfolio since 2003, the UAB HSR T32 program is as important now as it has ever been. Federal and state
laws, hospital closures, and limited rural healthcare providers result in an environment with formidable barriers
to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality mission-aligned priorities of making health care safer, higher
quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable. In this context, our overarching objective is to equip diverse
cohorts of pre- and postdoctoral fellows with the health services research and professional skills to become
change agents in the healthcare research workforce. MPD/MPI Michael Mugavero, MD, MHSc and Emily
Levitan, ScD collaborate with 9 Core Faculty and 49 Participating Faculty Mentors buttressed by an $84 million
extramural funding research base to deliver rigorous didactic and experiential training via the following specific
aims: 1. Cultivate a dynamic, inclusive, and engaging training environment. 2. Foster the conduct of mentored
research projects. 3. Train fellows in health services and outcomes research methodology and professional
skills. 4. Sponsor Certificate, Master’s, and Doctoral degrees. 5. Facilitate participation in enrichment
programs. 6. Evaluate program effectiveness. Numerous training program innovations are proposed, informed
by systematic program evaluation with feedback from an Advisory Committee and Alumni Council. These
include an immersive training experience in newly renovated physical space, increased emphasis on health
equity research methods, and the addition of hands-on Career Development Workshops and Office Hours with
methodologists from diverse disciplines. With this renewal, we propose continuation of 4 predoctoral and 5
postdoctoral slots, noting all slots have been filled in the history of the program, with roughly 5 applicants per
available slot (20% acceptance). We are deeply committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity, with 31% of
UAB HSR T32 fellow slots appointed to persons from backgrounds underrepresented in biomedical research in
the current reporting period. The performance of our trainees has been outstanding, with 100% program
completion, 125 fellow publications, and 6 alumni receiving extramural K awards in the current reporting
period. Overall, 79% of program alumni remaining in the healthcare research workforce. Institutional
commitments include newly renovated physical space housing the COERE and UAB HSR T32 training
program, and funding for training program faculty and staff salaries, an additional postdoctoral slot, and training
and enrichment programs. We are deeply committed to catalyzing the careers of the next generation of change
agents who improve health outcomes and overcome inequities in the U.S. Deep South and beyond."
10869981,"Building on our success over the last five decades, our plans to train the next generation of
health services researchers builds on the recognition that science and context must continually
evolve so that new researchers are prepared to provide the evidence needed to inform future
decisions of organizations, practitioners, policy makers, communities, and patients to result in
better health. The Johns Hopkins pre-doctoral AHRQ NRSA training program aims to
prepare PhD-level health services researchers in three intersecting updated high priority areas:
1) Understanding how the Financing and Organization of Healthcare Services Affect
Efficiency, Quality, and Equity of Care addresses how our healthcare system’s public and
private financing mechanisms and organizational structure affect health; 2) Advancing Patient
Safety, Quality and Patient-Centered Outcomes addresses traditional and evolving areas
with the rise in person-centered care, value based purchasing, health information technology
and emerging data sources, and the importance of diagnostic excellence; and 3) Promoting
Health Equity for Historically Marginalized and Vulnerable Populations is designed to
improve our focus on populations underserved by lack of access to quality health and social
services and vulnerable groups with complex care needs that often lead to poorer quality of care
and outcomes. Our pre-doctoral training builds on a common core of course work emphasizing
rigorous skills including study design, statistical analysis, measurement, data/health information
technology use, evaluation, and policy analysis. We base our training on a detailed set of core
competencies and learning objectives developed in accordance with the 2005 AHRQ sponsored
national “HSR core competencies” conference hosted by our Department and updated in 2012
and 2018. To address transformational factors and emerging problems in the U.S. health care
system, we will increase our emphasis on changing financing and systems, health information
technology, and promoting health equity. Trainees will gain exposure and research experience
through coursework, seminars, individual involvement in faculty research, and practica. AHRQ
will support three years of training for 3-4 new pre-doctoral students per year. Our program
offers personalized small group and one-on-one support and guidance by experienced mentors
to ensure a coordinated, successful training program experience for each trainee. Our training
program is well integrated with Department, School and University active research programs

We are applying for support to continue the Harvard Health Policy Training Program and seek monies over a
five-year period for eight predoctoral students. This program is embedded in Harvard’s Interfaculty PhD
Program in Health Policy, which aims to train a diverse set of investigators in health policy and health services
research, consistent with the mission of AHRQ. Our students have written dissertations on topics related to
many of AHRQ’s strategic research goals, including quality and patient safety, prevention and care
management, health care access and equity, and evaluating organizational and payment interventions. The
PhD Program is a collaboration among six Harvard faculties and is administered by a 57-member faculty
committee that is appointed by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences; the Committee is chaired by
David Cutler, the Program Director for this grant application.
The philosophy of the PhD Program is that students will work as part of an interdisciplinary research team and
therefore need a discipline that they bring to the team, as well as an understanding of the disciplines of other
team members or potential readers of their work. To implement this philosophy, students choose one of five
disciplines (decision sciences, economics, management, methods for policy research, political analysis) in
which they take most of their coursework; additionally, they take a year-long survey course in health policy, as
well as coursework in three other disciplines. Students also receive instruction in grant writing, and training in
oral and written presentations. Due to intensive monitoring and advising, most students finish their degree in
five or six years. Of the 345 students who have ever begun the PhD Program, 257 have graduated and 67 are
currently enrolled.
We have had our current training grant since 1994 and over that time have appointed 135 students as AHRQ
trainees, typically for two years. We have attracted a high-quality applicant pool and have many more qualified
persons who could be trainees; we have always filled our training grant slots. Our trainees have taken jobs in
academia, research institutions, and government, and they generally have received multiple job offers. Several
have won awards for their predoctoral research and also for their research and teaching after the degree. For
example, eight students from our program have received the AcademyHealth Outstanding Dissertation Award
and one has received Honorable Mention, and five have received the Alice S. Hersch Emerging Leader Award
from AcademyHealth."

10895309,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The development and function of tubular organs, including the lungs, intestines, and inner ear, depends
in part on an apical extracellular matrix (aECM) that lines the organ interior. aECMs contain many components
that are shared across organisms such as mucins, collagens, and zona pellucida domain (ZP) proteins. Matrix
proteins are often arranged into distinct layers or spatial domains within an organ; however, these structures
are often destroyed by fixation, limiting the ability to study how they are formed.
 This proposal uses the well characterized and highly tractable model of the developing C. elegans
vulva to understand how aECM is specified and assembled. Due to its transparent body and the ease of
fluorescently tagging proteins, C. elegans is an ideal system to study aECM in a live organism. Many of the
aECM domains in the vulva are cell type specific, allowing us to directly connect the assembly of matrix
proteins to the biology of the cells they coat. This study focuses on two ZP matrix proteins, LET-653 and
NOAH-1, that localize to the matrix of specific vulva cells. Like ZP proteins in some other systems, such as the
mammalian inner ear, the localization of LET-653 and NOAH-1 is not well explained by their transcription
patterns. ZP proteins require protease cleavage to properly localize and must also bind surface factors at their
destination site. The identity of these ZP protein partners is unknown. Aim 1 will dissect the relative
contributions of each cell type to the expression, processing and export, and matrix localization of ZP proteins.
It will also identify the transcription factors required for cell type specific matrix fate. Aim 2 will identify
candidate ZP protein partners with differential expression between cell types by single nucleus RNA
sequencing (snRNA-Seq) and test their requirement for ZP matrix assembly. Ultimately, these experiments will
uncover a gene regulatory network that specifies apical matrix identity and identify ZP protein partners that
could be applicable to many systems.
 This project is designed to provide training in epithelial and matrix biology, as well as relevant
techniques in single cell transcriptomics, genetics, and microscopy. It is sponsored by Dr. Meera Sundaram, an
expert in matrix biology and C. elegans vulva development, and co-sponsored by Dr. John Murray, an expert in
gene regulatory networks and single cell technologies in C. elegans. The research will be conducted at the
University of Pennsylvania, an institution with a collaborative and stimulating intellectual environment as well
as first-rate facilities and resources to conduct biomedical research. The proposed training plan incorporates
many professional development opportunities available through the university, sponsors, and C. elegans
community. At the conclusion of the proposed research and professional activities, the applicant will be
prepared for a career incorporating teaching undergraduates and running her own laboratory."
10914178,"Background: Community reintegration is a critical period of transition for post-9/11 Veterans. Difficulties
associated with the transition out of military service are well documented and include challenges such as social
isolation and loss of structure. Depression is common among reintegrating post-9/11 Veterans and can further
complicate these reintegration challenges. Despite the well-documented needs of post-9/11 Veterans and
numerous resources, Veterans continue to report inadequate support and are not using available services. As
such, it is critical to develop reintegration services that can effectively address Veterans' mental health care
needs using approaches that increase the likelihood of Veteran engagement.
Significance: The Veterans Affairs (VA) Administration has committed to addressing the transition-related
challenges of the post-9/11 Veteran cohort, particularly programming to support their mental health care
needs. Mental health is also a priority research area. The VA's 2022-2028 Strategic Plan includes a strategic
goal that ensures VA programs and initiatives support the whole person and address mental health and other
challenges affecting Veterans' well-being, including the military-to-civilian transition. The REconnecting to
Civilian Life using Activities that Improve Mindfulness (RECLAIM) intervention addresses the priority and
strategy of addressing reintegrating post-9/11 Veterans' mental health. We will also elicit Veterans'
experiences in participating in a virtual intervention to expand the understanding of how best to design and
implement interventions with virtual components, which informs another high priority research area.
Innovation and impact: RECLAIM introduces a variety of brief mindfulness-based practices (averaging 10
minutes), which are integrated with additional components, such as education and group discussion, that focus
on aspects of Veterans' community reintegration (e.g., sleep, relationships). RECLAIM sessions expand on
traditional practice offerings (body scan, yoga) to include other mindfulness practices (inner resource,
restorative meditations) that have demonstrated positive impacts on participants' overall functioning and can
mitigate anxiety, stress, and depression. The variety of brief practices in RECLAIM allows Veterans to easily
integrate these practices into their daily lives and explore several types of practices to find what best meets
their needs. This approach increases the likelihood of continued engagement and, therefore, continued benefit.
Additionally, virtual delivery of RECLAIM is based on previous research suggesting that virtual offerings may
enhance Veterans' engagement with mindfulness-based interventions.
Specific aims: The specific aims of this project are (1) conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to assess
feasibility of the RECLAIM intervention; (2) conduct qualitative interviews to assess acceptability of RECLAIM;
and (3) refine and prepare the RECLAIM intervention for broader testing.
Methodology: In Aim 1, we will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled pilot study to assess aspects of
feasibility (e.g., recruitment, randomization, retention in both the intervention and control arms). In Aim 2, we
will use qualitative interviews to elicit input from a purposefully sampled subgroup of Aim 1 RECLAIM
participants (N=16) to assess acceptability. We will use rapid qualitative inquiry to conduct the analysis. In Aim
3, we will use the findings from Aims 1 and 2 to iteratively refine the RECLAIM protocol and testing procedures.
We will consult with a panel of Veterans from the HSR&D CHIC Research Advisory Panel and operational
partners (e.g., Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation).
Next steps/implementation: Findings from the proposed pilot project will directly inform and provide key pilot
data for a Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) Merit
grant application. The future IIR will assess the effectiveness of RECLAIM in a fully powered randomized
controlled trial while simultaneously planning for implementation."

Since 2013, our AHRQ T32 program has successfully recruited diverse fellows and prepared them for health
services research careers. We have trained 24 researchers, resulting in 35 presentations and 26 publications.
Five of our trainees are still engaged in the training program and are on track to meet all our stated objectives;
of the nineteen graduates, seven (six postdoctoral and one predoctoral who completed his PhD) have
appointments at academic institutions and two are completing their PhDs at the BUSPH. This competitive
renewal builds on our successful program in several important ways. We are expanding the diversity in content
by including trainees and mentors from the Department of Surgery. We are also adding additional didactic and
training and experiential opportunities and social determinants of health and health equity. Our interdisciplinary
predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowship aims to produce Family Medicine, General Internal Medicine,
Pediatrics, Surgery and Public Health researchers who will lead efforts to improve health care delivery for
underserved patients. The four objectives of our program are to: (1) Recruit and retain high-quality,
diverse candidates interested in research careers focused on improving health care quality, access, and
delivery for underserved patients; (2) Provide predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows with comprehensive
research training; (3) Produce graduates who will conduct research on health care quality, delivery, and
health outcomes for low-income populations and whose research translates to systems change; and (4)
Evaluate our program for continuous improvement. The program is led by Dr. Marc LaRochelle, an
experienced researcher and mentor, and Co-Directed by an interdisciplinary team of senior scientists. We have
established four pedagogical structures essential to training research fellows: (1) Intensive mentoring; (2)
Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) courses culminating in a Master’s in Population Health for
postdoctoral fellows and a PhD for predoctoral fellows; (3) Interdisciplinary academic seminars; and (4)
Supervised conduct of at least two research projects. Predoctoral training includes the first 3 didactic years of
the PhD program. Postdoctoral training is 2 years. Each year, we will train 3 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral
fellows. Fellows will become health service researchers focused on health care quality, delivery, and outcomes
for low-income populations. We track graduates 1, 5, and 10 years after graduation (goal: >85% enter research
careers focused on improving healthcare quality; >70% remain in health services research after 3 years; >50%
lead efforts to implement new care models and have >1 funded research within 5 years)."

implementation activities aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of the U.S. health care system, and be
able to effectively inform both public and private policymakers how to design and assess such activities and
changes. Taking advantage of the expertise of faculty and researchers at these institutions – over three dozen
of whom have agreed to be mentors – as well as a track-record of community involvement in the Los Angeles
area, the Training Program focuses on several key research topics in which the collaboration has particular
expertise: insurance, payment, and health system change; implementation, improvement science, and learning
health systems; patient, provider, and organizational decision-making; health outcomes measurement; health
equity; community-oriented population health; and health services outside of the clinic. Predoctoral trainees will
complete the PhD curriculum and requirements in the UCLA Department of Health Policy and Management.
The PhD program is designed to provide high-level methodological skills and applied training, with depth in
study design and evaluation, statistics/econometrics, and applications to the health care sector. Moreover,
each student is required to choose a cognate (examples include economics, sociology, public policy,
organizational behavior, and health care outcomes research) in which they take additional courses that
develop competencies in cognate-related theory, conceptual models and research methods. The postdoctoral
program will provide individualized training plans for postdoctoral trainees. Unlike many such programs in the
sciences, trainees are not assigned to work on particular projects. Upon entry into the program, they meet
individually with key faculty involved in the Training Program at the four collaborating institutions so that they
can learn about the opportunities in each institution and choose appropriate mentors and projects. During their
postdoctoral experience, they collaborate with the program's faculty and researchers, develop their own
research, submit journal articles, and write grant proposals to help facilitate their move to their next
professional position."

This project aims to develop a complete toolbox for a new technique of mosaic analysis that is compatible with
nearly all existing Drosophila melanogaster resources, without the need for further genetic modifications.
Mosaic analysis is a powerful approach for studying molecular and cellular mechanisms of human disease. By
generating homozygous cells in otherwise heterozygous animals, mosaic techniques allow tissue-specific
analysis of pleiotropic genes and have played key roles in many important discoveries in biology. Current
mosaic techniques in Drosophila primarily rely on the Flp/FRT site-specific recombination system and require a
pair of homologous chromosomes that each contains an FRT sequence near the centromere. However, most
existing genetic resources in Drosophila, such as deficiency libraries, transposon-disrupted mutant collections,
and strains derived from wild natural populations, do not harbor appropriate FRT sites, preventing their efficient
application in mosaic analysis. New mosaic techniques that do not depend on site-specific recombination
systems are needed to unleash the full potential of these existing resources. Mosaic analysis by gRNA-induced
crossing-over (MAGIC) is a new mosaic technique that does not require site-specific recombination and is
compatible with unmodified chromosomes. Although the effectiveness of MAGIC has been demonstrated in the
germline, the nervous system, and epithelial tissues, MAGIC reagents are presently only available for a single
chromosome arm. This project will first establish an optimized MAGIC toolkit that can be used for mosaic
analysis over the entire genome throughout Drosophila tissues. MAGIC screens will also be conducted to
identify deficiency lines that are associated with morphological defects in neurons and epithelial cells.
Specifically, four aims are proposed: (1) establish an optimized and complete MAGIC toolkit for all Drosophila
chromosome arms; (2) generate strains expressing Cas9 in precursor cells of diverse tissues for MAGIC
applications; (3) develop anti-CRISPR tools for safe and versatile MAGIC applications in Drosophila; and (4)
screen deficiency lines by MAGIC for genes involved in neuronal and epithelial morphogenesis. The
Drosophila strains and constructs developed in this project will be donated to the Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center and plasmid depositories, respectively, for easy distribution to the research community. The
screen results will be made publicly available for further identification and characterization of responsible
genes by interested labs. An advisory committee has been established to provide feedback to this project.
Community inputs will be solicited regarding candidate precursor Cas9 lines to generate. The proposed
MAGIC tools will allow exploitation of existing genetic resources in systematic gene-function analysis, genome-
wide genetic screens, and tissue-specific analysis of natural variants. Attaining the goals of this project will
provide the Drosophila community important tools and information that can greatly enhance the value of
existing Drosophila resources for understanding human disease."

GEMIN5, an RNA-binding protein, is essential for assembly of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN)
complex. GEMIN5 facilitates the formation of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs; the
building blocks of spliceosomes). We identified novel autosomal recessive variants in the
GEMIN5 gene in multiple patients presenting with motor dysfunction, ataxia, and cerebellar
atrophy.
Our proposed studies are aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms of mutant GEMIN5
responsible for causing the neurological abnormalities in our patients. We found that patient a
significant decrease in GEMIN5 protein levels and reduced protein stability in patient iPSC
neurons suggesting a possible loss of function mechanism. Our in vitro assembly assay
showed that GEMIN5 variants perturb snRNP assembly formation. To understand the
consequences of loss of function GEMIN5, we knockdown endogenous rigor mortis, the
Drosophila homologue of human GEMIN5, in Drosophila. Knockdown of rigor mortis (rig)
caused motor dysfunction, reduced life span and developmental delay. Interestingly, we
observed that CoQ10 levels were significantly reduced in human patient cells and our
drosophila model. Treatment with CoQ10 reduced the disease course in human GEMIN5
patients. We generated a mouse model of Gemin5 using CRISPR/cas9 and found early lethality
in mice. Our proposed studies are aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms of GEMIN5
by 1) conducting functional analysis of mutant GEMIN5 patient neurons; 2) examining if
GEMIN5 variants cause mitochondrial dysfunctions in vivo and iPSC neurons; and 3)
investigating the mechanisms of GEMIN5 mutations in mouse models. We expect to identify the
molecular pathways that are perturbed in human patients."

We respond to Notice of Special Interest: Research in the Emergency Setting, and will build upon the Compre-
hensive Oncologic Emergency Research Network (CONCERN). For many cancer patients, Immune Check-
point Inhibitors (ICPIs) can be life-saving. However, the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) from ICPIs can
be debilitating, and can quickly become severe, or even be fatal. Often irAEs will precipitate visits to the emer-
gency department (ED). Therefore, early recognition and the decision to admit, observe or discharge these pa-
tients from the ED can be key to a cancer patient’s morbidity and mortality. ED clinicians typically make their
decision for disposition (admit, observe or discharge) within 2-6 hours from their patient’s ED presentation.
However, irAEs are particularly challenging in the ED because of atypical presentations, the absence of classic
symptoms, delayed availability of diagnostic tests during the ED encounter, and the fast pace in the ED setting.
At present, there is no single sufficiently large ED data source with clinical, biological, laboratory, and imaging
data that will allow for the development of a tool that will guide early recognition and appropriate ED dispo-
sition of patients with potential irAEs. Therefore, we propose to capitalize on a multi-site collaboration
among 4 CONCERN EDs (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Northwestern University and
University of California San Diego) in different States, to achieve the following aims: 1) To develop a probability
model [the Immune-related Emergency Disposition Index (IrEDi)] to risk stratify ED patients on ICPIs for ED
disposition. We will leverage our existing data (n=~2000) of unique ED patients who received ICPIs within 3
months of ED presentation at the 4 research sites. We hypothesize that host immune response underlie the
development of irAEs and that inflammation/immune biomarkers available during the ED encounter will im-
prove the prediction of Hospital admission; Observation; or Discharge, along with traditional factors, i.e. epide-
miological factors (age, race/ethnicity), biological factors (sex, BMI), cancer (type, stage/metastases) and treat-
ment-related variables (class of ICPI, monotherapy versus combination, dose/duration), and clinical status
(comorbidities, preexisting autoimmune diseases, vital signs, laboratory results, imaging study results); and 2)
To validate IrEDi using prospective data and determine the predictive validity of irEDi. We will conduct a pro-
spective cohort study of ED cancer patients who had received ICPIs, recruiting 1500 total from 4 sites over a 3-
year period. A common limitation of ED studies is that patients may receive care from multiple EDs. Thus, we
will conduct follow-up calls in 30 days to assess ED revisits or hospitalization. We hypothesize that IrEDi devel-
oped in aim 1 will have high sensitivity (≥90%) and high specificity (≥90%) for predicting appropriate ED dispo-
sition (hospital admission, observation, or discharge). If our aims are achieved, the IrEDi will be the first risk
stratification tool derived from a large racial/ethnically and geographically diverse population of cancer patients.
Our future goal is to validate irEDi in general EDs to improve emergency care of cancer patients on ICPIs."

Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated
abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype.
Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk
factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe
abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the
frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the
severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic
medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study
examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a
longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective
factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging
and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural
circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures
in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose
studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18-
40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and
early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing
frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and
task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and
neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test
competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and
machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment
data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry
abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of
neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination
of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and
protection from SZ using machine learning."

Our genetic screens in Drosophila previously identified several mutations with strong effects on
patterns of sleep. Recently we found that three of these genes, insomniac, cullin3 and nedd8, are
expressed in the blood-brain-barrier-forming subperineurial glia of the fly, and that the
morphological and biophysical properties of the barrier are altered in inc, cullin3, and nedd8
mutants. In our proposed studies we will test the effects of classical barrier mutants on sleep,
evaluate barrier function across the entire range of available sleep mutants and in aged vs young
flies, and explore evidence for regulatory interactions among sleep and classical barrier-regulating
genes. Most Drosophila sleep mutants severely reduce longevity. We will determine whether
mutations that increase longevity also improve barrier function and sleep duration in sleep
mutants. In a second branch of our proposed research we will examine the role of circadian clock
genes in commonly encountered disorders of human sleep. We recently discovered a mutation of
the circadian clock gene CRY1 that is associated with a form of delayed sleep phase disorder
(DSPD) that affects ~1 in 100 individuals worldwide. The results of our study suggest a novel
approach for exploring the heritability of similarly common sleep disorders: Predictive algorithms
will be applied to several large human exome databases to select candidate circadian variants for
cellular phenotyping. Prevalent alleles that are associated with altered circadian rhythmicity in cell
culture assays also will be studied by behavioral phenotyping of carrier subjects identified by
collaborators at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. Disordered sleep is often accompanied by
chronic diseases including diabetes, obesity, or certain mood and anxiety disorders. Although
causality in such instances has been difficult to establish by traditional approaches, we will employ
deep physiological and behavioral phenotyping of individuals sharing specific genetic variations
affecting sleep in tests for linkage to specific co-morbidities. These studies may significantly enrich
our understanding of biological pathways regulated by circadian clocks in humans as well as
fundamental disease etiologies."

With increasing age, blood vessels become stiffer and more calcified. In the latter years of the human lifespan,
the process of vascular aging accelerates. The reason that blood vessels lose their youthful elasticity and
ability to retard the deposition of calcium precipitously later in life is poorly understood. Ectonucleotidases are
found on the surface of endothelial cells which line the inner surface of blood vessels, vascular smooth muscle
cells, and leukocytes. The ectonucleotidase CD39 is responsible for cleaving ATP and ADP to form AMP, and
subsequently, CD73 is responsible for generating adenosine from AMP. Since ATP and ADP are pro-
inflammatory and act in a paracrine fashion, I hypothesize that ectonucleotidase activity plays a role in the
vascular stiffness and calcification that occurs as a consequence of age. This is supported by my preliminary
data in wild type (C57BL/6) mice, which demonstrates CD73 protein levels declined with age (up to 24 months)
in the heart and kidney. This is also supported by preliminary data in mice and human tissues demonstrating
that loss of CD73 expression promoted expression of the transcription factor Runx2, which is critical for
osteogenesis. We hypothesize that loss of ectonucleotidase expression with age could have deleterious
consequences on the vessel wall, resulting in an environment which promotes vascular calcification and
stiffness. Since the role of ectonucleotidases in vascular aging is unknown, we will elucidate mechanisms
which mediate age-dependent vascular calcification through the following aims. Aim 1: We will determine how
age-dependent decline in vascular ectonucleotidase expression renders vessels susceptible to vascular
calcification and fibrosis in a murine model. Aim 2: We will determine how ectonucleotidase activity mitigates
arterial fibrosis and stiffness. Aim 3: We will determine if ectonucleotidase expression plays a role in age-driven
human coronary artery calcification. Achievement of these aims will elucidate the role of ectonucleotidases in
age-dependent vascular calcification and stiffness in mice and humans. The mechanistic insights obtained
from these experiments will define my future investigative direction and serve as a foundation for a subsequent
RO1 application as an independent investigator studying vascular biology and aging."

 More than 250 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), living at increased
risk of liver failure, cancer, and early death. Though there is a vaccine to prevent HBV infection, it does not
prevent vertical transfer, nor does it help the millions of people already infected. While there are therapies (e.g.
nucleoside analogs) to suppress virus replication, treatment is life-long and rarely leads to cure. Achieving a
functional cure for chronic HBV infection therefore represents a major global unmet medical need.
 Fortunately, new classes of HBV inhibitors are being developed and some have already entered clinical
trials, but many fundamental (and clinically-relevant) aspects of HBV biology remain unanswered. The broad
long-term objectives of this project are to address knowledge gaps in the field using a new cell culture-based
method we developed to initiate HBV replication with RNA. Specifically, we capitalize on the most unique
features of this technology to (i) address a practical problem of drug development—antiviral resistance, (ii) to
fill gaps in our fundamental knowledge of HBV protein translation and genome replication, and (iii) as a
discovery tool to identify host factors that restrict or promote the HBV lifecycle.
 There is currently no way to assess antiviral resistance with existing HBV cell culture-based systems.
With our RNA approach, we take advantage of the fact that phage polymerases (e.g. T7) commonly used to in
vitro-transcribe RNA are error-prone. As such, initiating HBV replication with RNA rather than DNA (like most
systems) allows a diverse population of viral variants to be sampled. As we show with compelling preliminary
data, this sequence diversity coupled with deep sequencing technology makes it possible to select for and
detect rare HBV drug-resistant viral variants. Aim 1 of this proposal is to further develop this technology.
 Initiating HBV replication with RNA largely eliminates the background signal that contaminates HBV
qPCR reactions, and since not all viral RNAs are required to initiate replication, some viral proteins are made
only if the viral lifecycle progresses and the viral DNA template—covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)—is
established. We capitalize on this in Aim 2 to study fundamental aspects of HBV protein translation and
genome replication, and in Aim 3 to discover virus-host interactions. Specifically we use the method in Aim 2 to
study mutations that frequently arise in chronically infected individuals and differences in HBV genotypes. We
use the method in Aim 3 as the basis for a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify HBV host factors.
 Until we have a solution for eliminating chronic HBV, continuing and new fundamental studies of HBV
biology are needed to identify new strategies that can be explored for therapeutic intervention. The new RNA-
based system we developed to study HBV biology and assess antiviral resistance align well with the NIH's
strategic plan to cure chronic HBV and the work we propose will contribute significantly to this ongoing effort."

Mammalian cells exhibit a precise gene regulation process, during which enhancers mediate rapid gene
activation programs in response to different signals and ligands. While many principles of chromosomal
mechanisms underlying enhancer functions have been deduced in the 39 years since their initial discovery,
striking gaps in our knowledge remain. These include actions of a series of previously unknown, but required,
enhancer-recruited complexes; contributions of physicochemical properties of enhancer condensates formed on
the estrogen receptor  (ER) in signaling-dependent regulation; and the potentially important roles of
interactions with subnuclear architectural structures. Further, because global genomic methods determine
epigenomic events at only a single point in time, another striking gap in our knowledge is understanding the
temporal principles underlying regulation of regulated transcriptional programs. Under physiological conditions,
many signals present as a continuum from acute to chronic stimulation; however, the mechanistic and functional
distinctions between acute and chronic enhancer activation remain poorly understood. Here, we take advantage
of our knowledge of gene transcriptional control by nuclear receptors, exemplified by estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2)-
dependent activation of transcriptional programs to address these basic questions. The central challenge in this
competitive renewal is to provide a unified molecular logic that mechanistically links a series of required, but
overlooked, components of signal-dependent enhancer activation strategies that underlie acute and chronic
regulated gene expression programs. We will initiate a comprehensive investigation of new dynamic enhancer
complexes and their interactions with the subnuclear architectural structures critically regulating transcription.
These include the function of promoter antisense transcripts in promoter pause-release regulation; investigation
of required contributions of Ku70 homodimers reading the TopoisomerseI:DNA covalent intermediate to
assemble a new complex required for promoter pausing and enhancer activation events. We will investigate
whether short sequences and specific amino acids in the ERN-terminal IDR mediate assembly of key RNP
condensate components required for robust activation, including an unexpected role of KAP1 in these activation
events. We will establish real time, multicolor imaging to uncover the dynamics of activated enhancer
interactions, enhancer bursting events and relationship of activation to interactions with subnuclear architectural
structures. We will explore the hypothesis that the most robust eRNA:protein enhancer condensates form a
homotypic enhancer network resulting in cooperative activation of a subset of similarly activated homotypic
enhancers separated by multiple TADs or even located on other chromosomes, properties are lost following
chronic signal/ligand activation. These approaches will be complemented by alternative approaches for defining
the dynamics of interactions between enhancers and subnuclear architectural structures. Our goal is to provide
novel insights into regulated enhancer and promoter activation mechanisms."

Enzymes with complex metallocofactors in their active sites catalyze myriad transformations relevant to human health and
disease. Understanding their reaction mechanisms requires molecular-level characterization of their resting states and
intermediate states, and metal-specific spectroscopic techniques are especially useful in this endeavor. However, the high-
nuclearity of many metallocofactors can limit the usefulness of such techniques; the signals arising from multiple metal
sites can be challenging to resolve, especially in mixtures of reaction intermediates. Moreover, it is often impossible to map
the rich spectroscopic information onto the geometric structure, and this severely limits our understanding of the chemical
bonding—and therefore the reactivity—of complex metallocofactors. We propose to address these challenges by developing
methods for modifying the isotopic and elemental compositions of complex metallocofactors, in particular the nitrogenase
catalytic cofactors. Nitrogenases are responsible for supplying a significant portion of the fixed nitrogen on the planet, and
they therefore play an important role in maintaining a healthy and growing human population. Their catalytic cofactors are
among the most complex in Nature, and as a result their reaction mechanisms have been especially difficult to characterize.
To overcome these challenges and gain new insights into the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation, we will develop
chemical methods for precisely altering the isotopic and elemental composition of nitrogenase cofactors. Our approach will
be to discover mild protocols for removing specific Fe sites in nitrogenase cofactors and subsequently replacing them with
57Fe. The site-selectivity of the label will allow for the electronic structure (as elucidated spectroscopically) to be connected
to the geometric structure (as defined crystallographically), and will thereby provide unprecedented insights into the
chemical bonding and reactivity of nitrogenase cofactors. Studies of these cofactors in both their resting states and
intermediate states comprise the heart of the proposal. We will also extend the site-selective 57Fe labeling protocol to
incorporating different metals into specific sites of nitrogenase cofactors. This will yield artificial metalloenzymes that will
serve as mechanistic probes with potentially unique properties and/or reactivity. Completion of this project will provide
unprecedented mechanistic insights into biological nitrogen fixation and will articulate concepts and protocols for rendering
complex metallocofactors as mechanistically tractable as mononuclear active sites."

During acute infection, animals display a set of highly stereotyped symptoms which are critical for survival. These
symptoms include changes in physiology, such as fever, as well as behavioral changes such as lethargy and
loss of appetite. How do sickness symptoms arise? The generation of fever in response to infection has been
reported in warm-blooded animals as well as cold-blooded reptiles and even invertebrates, suggesting that
evolutionarily-conserved, hard-wired mechanisms exist to bring about fever during an immune response.
Changes to thermoregulatory and other homeostatic circuits in the brain are likely required to generate sickness
symptoms, but the mechanisms by which immune signals are translated into the brain and into neuronal activity
to alter these circuits are currently unknown. I have identified a population of neurons in the preoptic area of the
hypothalamus that is highly sensitive to the administration of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In my
preliminary experiments, I have found that these neurons are critical for the initiation of fever and they may also
contribute to other sickness symptoms such as warmth-seeking behavior and loss of appetite. In work proposed
here I will rigorously test the function of this LPS-sensitive neuronal population using the latest tools for behavior-
specific cell type manipulation. I will uncover how these neurons regulate fever as well as other sickness
symptoms. In addition, I will use viral-mediated tracing tools to uncover the circuit mechanism by which these
LPS-sensitive neurons modulate thermoregulatory and feeding circuits. The successful completion of these aims
will reveal the first discovered neural circuits that mediate sickness.
Many studies have found increased activation of glial cell types in response to LPS or infection, which may be
essential for the activation of fever-initiating circuits. In my final aim, I will use the latest technology for molecular
cell type identification to uncover the identity of the neurons as well as the subtypes of non-neuronal populations
in the preoptic hypothalamus that contribute to the fever response. During my R00 phase, I will identify the non-
neuronal populations that are essential for fever initiation and reveal new molecular mechanisms by which these
cell types communicate with neurons and thereby generate a fever. The successful completion of this project
will provide a platform for future experiments aimed at understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying the generation of sickness symptoms.
The training phase of the award will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Catherine Dulac at Harvard University.
In addition, I will be mentored by the outstanding team of scientists on my advisory committee that will assist
with specific training goals as well as career guidance. In my application I have outlined a comprehensive plan
for the acquisition of conceptual, technical and professional skills that will enable my transition to an independent
research position."

 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia and is associated with increased
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence suggests that the autonomic nervous system plays a
central role in the pathogenesis of AF, especially in the early stages and several studies from our group and
others have shown that autonomic modulation with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can suppress AF in
experimental models. We have exciting preliminary data from our recently completed randomized clinical trial
showing that in ambulatory patients with paroxysmal AF, chronic, intermittent transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) over
6 months resulted in a significant decrease in AF burden compared to sham stimulation. However, the response
to tVNS was variable among individual patients, highlighting the notion that while tVNS is an emerging, promising
modality for AF, the dosing and/or patient selection have to be optimized. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
develop biomarkers that could 1) determine the optimal dosing regimen and 2) select the ideal candidates for
tVNS therapy, and thus optimally guide AF management. Our proposed studies will test the overall hypothesis
that the effects of tVNS on autonomic tone and atrial substrate can be used to guide and optimize therapy.
Importantly, we have recently shown that P-wave alternans (PWA), a subtle beat-to-beat variation in the
morphology of the P-wave, diminished in the active, compared to the sham group over a 6-month period and the
decrease correlated with AF burden reduction. Therefore, we hypothesize that PWA is a useful tool for guiding
tVNS therapy for AF. We have also recently shown that the decrease in AF burden correlated with serum levels
of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a surrogate marker of sympathetic activity. Therefore, our proposed studies will test
the hypothesis that assessment of subtle beat-to-beat variations in the P-wave morphology of the
electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum levels of NPY can be used to first, determine the optimal parameters and
second, guide tVNS treatment. Our specific aims are: 1. To determine the effects of tVNS on autonomic tone,
atrial substrate and neuromodulators in patients with paroxysmal AF. 2. To investigate the chronic effects of
optimal tVNS on AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF over a 6-month period, compared with sham
stimulation and 3. To identify physiological and biochemical markers of response to chronic tVNS. We anticipate
that the results of these studies will first, provide insights into the effects of tVNS on autonomic tone, AF substrate
and neuromodulators, and second, permit optimization of tVNS using PWA, NPY and metabolomic biomarkers
to reduce AF burden of afflicted patients. By introducing an optimized tVNS treatment protocol, results from
our proposed studies have the potential to overturn the current scientific paradigm for treatment of AF, and
thus, lead to major improvements in health care delivery. Because of the increasing number of patients with
AF and the poor success and potential side effects of the available treatment options, an alternative approach
such as tVNS has the potential to impact clinical practice and improve outcomes for these patients."

Many of the molecular mechanisms underlying well-characterized robust and rapidly inducible transcriptional
responses are shared among other systems, so we use hormone-induced transcriptional responses to study
gene regulation. We use rapid kinetic regulation and perturbation of transcription cascades, transcription
factors, and cofactors to identify key mechanisms, genes, and regulatory elements that are critical for hormone
signaling. Transcription factors act as activators or repressors and interface with a constellation of accessory
cofactors to regulate distinct steps in the transcription to coordinate gene expression, but the molecular
functions of the vast majority of transcription factors remain uncharacterized. We use molecular genomics
assays and computational methods to classify transcription factors by their molecular function, as opposed to
broad activator and repressor classes, in order to understand the context specificity of gene regulation. We
found that the estrogen receptor transcription factor may compete with other transcription factors for limiting
cofactors to mediate estrogen-induced repression. We will develop genetic tools to uncouple activation and
repression to test various models of repression, such as squelching cofactors from repressed genes. The
genes and regulatory elements that are downstream of the first wave of transcriptional response are critical for
propagating regulatory cascades. We generate high resolution, genome-wide time course data of regulatory
element activity and nascent transcription upon stimulation of differentiation processes. We construct
mechanistically interpretable networks to identify effector genes and regulatory elements that are critical for
signaling in regulatory cascades. Our research reveals basic principles and rules that govern transcription
factor specificity in order to understand how genetics, nutrition, and environmental factors contribute to
variation in transcriptional programs that can lead to disease states or ineffective therapies."

Over the last 20 years there has been an explosion in the number of recognized human genetic diseases of
making ribosomes, the ribosomopathies, most of which are inherited, congenital conditions. Despite the clear
impact of abnormalities in ribosome biogenesis on human disease, ribosome biogenesis in human cells is just
beginning to be investigated and elucidated. Key challenges now are to pinpoint how ribosomes are made in
human cells, to define how this critical process is regulated in different tissues and in diverse cell types
throughout embryonic development, and to probe how failures in this process lead to the human diseases of
making ribosomes.
 As one novel approach to better probe the mechanisms underlying how ribosomes are made in human cells,
we have successfully developed a unique, highly-quantitative and image-based cellular assay that reports
nucleolar dysfunction (Cell Reports 2018; PLoS Genetics 2020; Molecular Biology of the Cell 2021; RNA
2022). We have conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen in near-diploid MCF10A human breast epithelial
cells to identify cellular proteins that change nucleolar number. This screen was the first RNAi campaign to use
nucleolar number as an endpoint, and the first screen of its type carried out in a human cell line other than
Hela cells. This unbiased screening approach revealed many new cellular proteins (the “hits”) not previously
connected to making ribosomes. Extending this work to non-coding RNAs, we have now applied our robust
screening assay to systematically identify microRNAs whose overexpression inhibits ribosome biogenesis, and
we are currently probing their mRNA targets and mechanisms of action.
From the genome-wide siRNA screen we have obtained and successfully validated both nucleolar and non-
nucleolar hits, prompting the hypothesis that the non-nucleolar proteins are novel indirect regulators of
ribosome biogenesis in human cells. With tailored technological strategies, we will further define the role of a
subset of the hits in ribosome biogenesis in human tissue culture cells, shedding light on unique regulatory
pathways. In addition, we will link a subset of them to a critical requirement in embryonic development using
Xenopus tropicalis as a model system. Once looked upon as a “housekeeping” organelle, our work will
highlight the nucleolus as a significant contributor to human genetic disease and congenital malformations."
10932911,"In recent years, the NIH has awarded over $850M annually to the numerous research institutions and hospitals
within the Texas Medical Center (TMC; Houston, TX), producing ever-increasing numbers of biomedical discov-
eries. Despite this massive investment, only some of these discoveries advance to the clinic, and even fewer
are successfully commercialized to improve patient health and well-being. Texas academic entrepreneurs face
significant challenges as they seek to commercialize their discoveries, including a lack of training and resources
to support early-stage business and technology development. To address these deficiencies, we will establish
the Gulf Coast Consortium Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (GCC-REACH) as an inte-
grated multi-institutional resource wherein nascent academic entrepreneurs work closely with successful life
science experts and experienced biotech executives to develop strategic milestone-driven timelines to rapidly
validate the commercial value of their discoveries. GCC-REACH will expand the GCC and TMC infrastructure
and resources we have designed to support emerging biomedical companies. Academic entrepreneurs will hail
from all GCC-affiliated institutions (Baylor College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Houston
Methodist Research Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Rice University, Texas Southern University, Univer-
sity of Houston, the University of Texas Health Science Center, University of Texas Medical Branch), Houston-
area colleges and universities with large historically-underrepresented groups, and other Texas research insti-
tutions. The GCC-REACH program will provide managerial oversight, access to vetted resources, and seed
funds to assist each entrepreneur in progressing to a clear value-added commercialization inflection point.
Significance. Discussions with numerous Texas-based researchers, all GCC-affiliated technology transfer of-
fices, successful life science companies, and healthcare investors have indicated widespread support for this
initiative, noting that it would help launch new companies and advance biomedical discoveries. Importantly,
GCC-REACH will pair entrepreneurs who balance full-time clinical, teaching, and laboratory duties with EIRs
and expert teams who will provide mentorship and assistance in completing the market analysis, business plans,
and technology development strategies.
Value proposition. In combination with substantial multi-institutional support, NIH's $4M investment will enable
GCC-REACH to train academic entrepreneurs to successfully commercialize novel discoveries. We expect these
entrepreneurs will launch approximately 60 highly-competitive early-stage biomedical companies that will be
highly competitive for non-dilutive NIH SBIR/STTR funding and venture investment."
10786045,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become one of the pillar therapies in treating cancer patients, exemplified by
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (e.g., anti-PD1). While ICIs have significantly improved the prognosis of
cancer patients, the response rate to ICI monotherapy remains low (10-20%) for many types of cancer, such as
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Some variability may be explained by human papillomavirus
(HPV)- vs. carcinogen-induced, tumor antigen-specific T cell responses in HPV+ or HPV− HNSCC, reflecting a
unique disease opportunity to investigate ICI responsiveness. Thus, it is vital to better understand the
mechanisms underlying heterogenous responses to ICI and to identify new targets that may sensitize HNSCCs
to mono- and combination immunotherapy. In this application, we propose to focus on T cell phenotypes
associated with clinical response, dynamic changes in specific T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes, and TCR
clonotype-specific transcriptomic changes in response to ICI treatment, using HNSCC patient samples from an
ongoing clinical trial at our institution and detailed studies using murine HNSCC models. Using HCC 18-139 trial
samples, we will compare tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from pre-
and post-treatment samples and examine TCR dynamics and T cell phenotypes in blood (minimally invasive and
readily accessible) and in tumors in the context of ICI-induced anti-tumor immunity. Our mouse model allows
functional validation among distinct TCR clonotypes correlating with ICI responses, and permits manipulation of
novel potential targets to enhance clinical responsiveness as well as lay the groundwork for future clinical trials.
Our proposed studies will identify cellular and molecular markers to better predict ICI responses in HNSCC
patients treated with different combinations of ICIs and would facilitate finding novel mechanisms of differential
ICI responses using transcriptomic differences in distinct clonal TCR-bearing T cell populations. A unique
strength of our proposal is integration of human clinical trial samples and mouse models as a more powerful
platform to uncover mechanistic insights that are translatable into the clinical setting."

Genome-wide association studies have identified common single nucleotide variants at over 160 genetic loci
associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcification,
carotid intima media thickness, and carotid plaque). These discoveries have led to important insights into the
pathways that contribute to subclinical atherosclerosis and CAD, as well as insights into the genetic architecture
of atherosclerosis. For example, the heritability explained by common genetic variants for CAD appears to be
concentrated in regulatory regions. Nevertheless, neither the genome-wide association studies nor exome
sequencing studies performed to date have been able to examine both coding and non-coding variants across
the allele frequency spectrum in relation to subclinical atherosclerosis and CAD. Furthermore, these studies
have largely focused on European ancestry participants. Approaches that identify pleiotropic loci or quantify
genetic correlation among phenotypes exist, but have not yet been applied to subclinical atherosclerosis and
CAD. Genetic risk prediction studies based on common variants show promise with regards to improving primary
prevention, but the extent to which adding low-frequency and rare variants to polygenic risk scores improves risk
prediction is not known, nor have scores been developed and tested in those of non-European ancestry.
A wealth of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data has been generated by initiatives such as the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program and the National
Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) program in
populations from different ancestries. To expand our knowledge of genetic factors contributing to CAD and
subclinical atherosclerosis phenotypes, we propose to use WGS data from TOPMed and CCDG (up to 101,295
individuals from diverse ancestries, of which 58% are non-European ancestry), with extended genomic coverage
of low-frequency and rare genetic variants as well as more complex genetic variants such as structural variants.
Findings from the WGS analysis will be replicated in several large-scale data sources, including exome
sequencing data and genotype data imputed using TOPMed as the reference panel. Thus, we will examine
genetic variation that has so far been missed, including structural variants.
We will leverage the results of these analyses to explore the genetic architecture of subclinical atherosclerosis
and CAD, investigate pleiotropy and genetic correlation between subclinical atherosclerosis and CAD and related
cardiovascular traits, as well as assess the contribution of low-frequency and rare variants to risk prediction of
CAD. Finally, we will create and test a polygenic risk score designed specifically for African ancestry population.
This proposal brings together large-scale WGS datasets, clinical and subclinical atherosclerosis phenotypes,
and exploits advances in genomic technologies and computational approaches. In doing so, we will advance the
realization of precision medicine for CAD."

Insulin resistance (IR) is necessary for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is a major cardiovascular
diseases risk factor. IR has few therapeutic options and identification of new drug targets and novel IR
mechanisms would have a huge impact on public health. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified hundreds IR-associated genetic loci, there has been limited progress towards identifying causal
genes and mechanisms.
Our colocalization analysis combined data from GWAS of IR-associated traits (T2D, fasting insulin, fasting
glucose, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)
and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) within five tissues related to IR or T2D (subcutaneous and visceral
adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver and pancreas). The analysis identified specific causal IR genes in about
25% of IR loci and in half of these cases, the effects are attributable to effects in adipose tissue.
We will extend our findings through larger colocalization studies and use single cell data to identify a credible
list of adipose cell specific IR causal genes (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will functionally characterize IR causal genes
for cellular mechanisms of action as well as define gene regulatory networks by employing single cell analyses
of transcriptomes and epigenomes following CRISPR gene perturbation. In Aim 3, we will define the
physiological role of causal genes in vivo by creating loss of function mouse models by combining a CRISPRi
mouse with the delivery of sgRNA and Cre recombinase via the adipose tissue specific AAV delivery system.
By combining human genetics, computational analysis, and functional genomics tools, we will establish causal
genes and their mechanisms of action in development of IR. This effort will lead to novel mechanisms and
drugs targets to address the unmet need posed by IR, T2D and cardiovascular disease."
10782452,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This project will examine the impact of taxes on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) utilizing
detailed sales data from one of the largest fast food retailers in the U.S. Taxes on SSBs are one of the
most promising solutions to reduce population-wide consumption of these unhealthful beverages and,
consequently, their contribution to obesity and the health challenges of cardiovascular disease,
diabetes and cancer. SSB taxes have reduced purchasing and consumption of SSBs in settings such
as supermarkets and other food stores across the seven U.S. cities that have implemented them.
However, fast food restaurants are also a key source of SSBs -- more than a third of U.S. adults
consume fast food on any given day, often including an SSB, and a single beverage at a fast food
restaurant contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories from added sugars in just
one serving – and have not been studied. The central hypothesis is that SSB taxes will reduce
purchase of SSBs at fast food restaurants, with a greater impact in lower-income census tracts, despite
less than complete “pass-through” of the tax to the consumer by the fast food restaurants. Using
detailed sales data and appropriate comparison groups from multiple communities, the study estimates
the influence of SSB tax policies in a detailed and causal way for several years after taxes are
implemented. The model is a difference-in-difference approach, taking advantage of the fact that some
locations implemented taxes and (most) others did not. The study will look at sales in localities that are
similar at baseline (before taxes) and determine how they diverge after a tax is implemented. This is the
first study to rigorously examine SSB taxes across the U.S. in a longitudinal manner, including
thousands of retail locations for Taco Bell and hundreds of millions of purchases. The national scale of
the data and multiple restaurants within each city that implemented a tax will allow estimation of
whether effects of taxes differ by community income, critical to understanding health disparities and the
regressive nature of SSB taxes.
The specific aims are:
  Aim 1: Determine the change in price paid in fast food restaurants as a result of SSB taxes (i.e.,
 effective “pass-through”).
  Aim 2: Determine the change in beverage calories purchased per customer order as a result of SSB
taxes.
  Aim 3: Determine how neighborhood characteristics, such as the income of the area in which a
 restaurant is located, influence both pass-through and beverage calories purchased in response
 to SSB taxes."
10782458,"Neuropathic pain (NP) is a debilitating disease that is difficult to manage. Current treatments are only partially
effective, in a small subset of patients. The development of effective analgesics for NP is stalled by our
incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. An important clue comes from our progress on this
project over the past 20 years with studies of the neurobiology of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its inhibitory
actions at excitatory interneurons (IN) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that express the NPY Y1 receptor
(Y1). Our long-term goal is the development of Y1 agonists that will engage and inhibit precise
subpopulations of Y1-INs and thus reduce NP. To this end, we confirmed that Y1-INs co-express either
cholecystokinin (Cck), gastrin-releasing peptide (Grp), or Neuropeptide FF (Npff) mRNA, and that
chemogenetic inhibition or ablation of Y1-IN blocked multiple signs of NP in mice with peripheral nerve injury.
Similarly, chemogenetic inhibition of protein kinase C type γ interneurons (PKCγ-INs) reversed touch-evoked
allodynia. Our central hypothesis is that nerve injury recruits a pronociceptive dorsal horn microcircuit that
includes excitatory presynaptic input from PKCγ-IN onto the subpopulations of Y1-INs that facilitate
neuropathic pain. Specific Aim 1 will use patch clamp dorsal horn slice electrophysiology to record
postsynaptic currents, and high-resolution confocal microscopy to measure appositions between pre and
postsynaptic elements of synapse, at Y1eGFP neurons. We predict that nerve injury will produce a net ratio
increase not only in presynaptic excitatory vs inhibitory drive, but also in the number of excitatory vs inhibitory
synapses, leading to a potentiation of neuronal activation in the CCK, GRP and/or Npff subpopulations of Y1-
INs. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that Y1-INs are necessary and sufficient for neuropathic pain. We
predict that wireless in vivo optogenetic activation of spinal Npy1rcre (Y1cre) neurons will produce nocifensive
and aversive behaviors in normal mice, while optogenetic inhibition will reverse mechanical and cold allodynia
in nerve-injured mice. Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that nerve injury recruits a pronociceptive PKCγ 
Y1-IN chronic pain circuit. We predict that chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of PKCγCreERT2 neurons will
increase pERK+ immunoreactivity (a proxy for in vivo neuronal activity) and excitatory postsynaptic currents
(EPSCs) in Y1eGFP reporter mice, while genetic inhibition of PKCγCreERT2 or pharmacological inhibition of PKCγ
will prevent or reduce SNI potentiation of touch-evoked neuronal activation, spontaneous EPSCs and/or
stimulus-evoked action potentials in Y1eGFP neurons. Specific Aim 4 will determine which subpopulations of
excitatory Y1-INs are necessary for the antiallodynic actions of intrathecal Y1 agonists. We predict that
conditional deletion of Y1 receptors in Lbx1cre spinal cord neurons as well as CckCre, GrpCre, and/or NpffCre
neurons will prevent the ability of Y1 agonists to reduce SNI-induced allodynia, touch-evoked pERK, and A-
fiber stimulus-evoked action potentials in Y1eGFP neurons."
10782460,"Background: More and more providers face cumulative stress and burdens arising from increasing
regulations, administrative and clerical duties, clinical workloads, malpractice lawsuits, and less time with
patients. As a result, stress, fatigue, psychological distress, depression, burnout, and career dissatisfaction
among providers are prevalent. In addition to impacting providers directly, poor well-being can negatively
impact healthcare organizations and reduce quality of care, patient safety and patient satisfaction. Additionally,
provider burnout, stress, and workload have been associated with poorer hand hygiene adherence, which can
increase the risk of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Hand hygiene is a key element of preventing HAI,
yet maintaining healthcare provider adherence to this basic practice remains challenging. Achieving optimal
hand hygiene adherence requires minimizing cognitive biases, such as perceived low odds of spreading
infections by not properly performing hand hygiene. Unfortunately, cognitive bias is a known barrier to clinician
decision-making. Mindfulness is an approach that can help clinicians shed preconceived biases through
nonjudgmental awareness and more broadly facilitate improvements in patient safety.
Significance: A hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention targeted at Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) providers could improve hand hygiene practices and thereby enhance patient outcomes. Additionally,
incorporating brief mindfulness practices during moments of hand hygiene has the potential to directly improve
provider well-being.
Innovation and Impact: While targeted interventions and bundled approaches to improve hand hygiene
adherence and reduce HAI have been implemented, interventions incorporating introspective techniques, such
as mindfulness, are limited. In a recent single-site pilot study, team members of this proposed study found that
a brief mindfulness intervention improved hand hygiene and mindful attention among physicians. The proposed
study will expand on this pilot work by more broadly testing the hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention
with both physicians and nurses, and by including a specific focus on provider well-being. The goal is to
optimize provider hand hygiene adherence, improve provider well-being and enhance the quality and safety of
care delivered to Veterans.
Specific Aims: We have three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of a hand hygiene-based
mindfulness intervention on provider hand hygiene adherence, duration, and perceptions. 2) To evaluate the
effectiveness of a hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention on measures of provider mindfulness and
well-being. 3) To identify the barriers, facilitators, and perceptions of a hand hygiene-based mindfulness
intervention in the hospital.
Methodology: We will conduct a randomized controlled mixed-methods trial at 2 diverse VHA hospitals.
Physicians and nurses randomized to the intervention arm will receive mindfulness education and tools to
prompt mindfulness during hand hygiene. Measures of hand hygiene (adherence, duration, and perceptions)
and measures of provider mindfulness and well-being will be collected and compared between the intervention
and control groups.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will work with our proposed partners to review our study findings, modify our
intervention as needed, and disseminate our findings through the various partnership channels. At the
conclusion of this project, we will have a hand hygiene-based mindfulness intervention package that we can
subsequently work to deploy more broadly across VHA hospitals to improve the safety of Veterans and the
well-being of those providing their healthcare."
10782461,"ABSTRACT
Hydrocephalus is a disorder of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) physiology that results in progressive expansion of
cerebral ventricles and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). It affects 1-2 of every 1000 live births, making it the
most common disease treated by pediatric neurosurgeons in the US. The usual treatment is neurosurgical shunt
placement to divert CSF and relieve elevated ICP. Decision-making about when and if to intervene is mostly
based on imaging evidence of enlarged ventricular size and clinical judgement. Ventricular size, however, is a
suboptimal surrogate of elevated ICP and ischemia. Indeed, roughly 15% of patients experiencing elevated ICP
do not have CT imaging evidence of increased ventricle size. The inconsistent relationship between ICP and
ventricular size increases the risk of prolonged intracranial hypertension, ischemia, and secondary brain damage
occurring prior to surgical treatment.
 The primary goals of this proposal are to: (1) develop and validate a novel diffuse optical approach for non-
invasive detection of elevated ICP and cerebral ischemia; and (2) use multimodal longitudinal diffuse optical
measures of cerebral hemodynamics to identify risk factors for the development of elevated ICP. Diffuse optics
techniques provide a wealth of multimodal cerebral hemodynamic data continuously, non-invasively, and at the
bedside. Specifically, diffuse optics technology can measure indices of cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen
extraction fraction (OEF), and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2). The principal investigator (PI) has also pioneered
a novel optical approach for assessment of elevated ICP. The approach is based on measurement of cerebral
critical closing pressure (CrCP) with near-infrared light intensity correlations. CrCP is the sum of ICP and active
arteriolar wall tension, and its name reflects the notion that arterioles close and CBF ceases when arterial blood
pressure falls below the CrCP threshold.
 This proposal will use diffuse optics to measure longitudinal hemodynamics of brain physiology during
progressive ventricular enlargement in a large group of children (Aim 1). The multimodal data will be related to
invasive intraoperative ICP measurements for: (1) identification of preoperative risk factors of elevated ICP; and
(2) validation of elevated CrCP as a metric of elevated ICP. Diffuse optical neuro-monitoring will further be
compared to invasive neuro-monitoring in a pediatric piglet model of intracranial hypertension to develop
optical biomarkers of ischemia and elevated ICP (Aim 2). In Aim 3, diffuse optics will be translated for
diagnosing shunt failure in older children, which occurs in 40% of patients within 2 years of age.
 The proposal’s interdisciplinary team of physical scientists and clinicians provides leading expertise in diffuse
optics, piglet model research, and hydrocephalus care. Ultimately, by allowing the timing of surgical intervention
to be optimized and individualized for each patient, diffuse optics promises to substantially reduce or prevent
secondary brain damage from hydrocephalus."
10782463,"A common thread in all forms of diabetes is β cell failure. Data have identified β cell signaling pathways activated during diabetes development that exacerbate β cell failure and death. Defining these pathways and their contribution to diabetes will ultimately pave the way for novel β cell targeted biomarkers and therapies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane bound nanoparticles that can be transferred to other cells as a means of cell:cell communication. Emerging data suggest that β cell-derived exosomes, an EV subtype released by exocytosis of multivesicular bodies, and their cargo may act as paracrine effectors in islet health. However, the mechanisms linking β cell stress to changes in exosome cargo and whether activation of these pathways can impact diabetes progression remain unexplored. The central hypothesis of this application is that DNA damage induced by islet inflammatory stress activates signaling pathways regulating β cell exosome miRNA cargo, initiating a cascade of β cell death and dysfunction through exosomal miRNA transfer to surrounding β cells. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanistic etiology of cytokine-induced alterations in β cell exosome microRNA cargo. We hypothesize that cytokine-induced β cell DNA damage and p53 activation engage ceramide-dependent exosomal formation pathways. This process ultimately increases ceramide-enriched exosome subpopulations, and drives critical differences in exosome miRNA cargo. To test this, experiments will utilize chemical and genetic manipulation of β cell DNA damage, p53 activation, and ceramide generation. Aim 2 will utilize in vitro and in vivo models to determine the functional relevance of β cell exosome microRNA cargo transfer to other β cells. We hypothesize that cytokine-induced alterations in β cell exosome miRNA cargo exacerbate β cell death, dedifferentiation, and dysfunction by exosomal transfer of miRNAs to surrounding β cells. Aim 3 will utilize a bead based pulldown to enrich human circulating EV pools for islet cell-derived EVs. We hypothesize that proteins specific to β cells will also be present in β cell EVs, therefore enabling selective isolation of β cell-derived EVs. We will test whether human subjects with or at-risk for diabetes exhibit altered circulating islet cell-derived EV miRNAs. Functional experiments will define differential effects of incubation of circulating islet-derived EVs on recipient human β cells. This work will lead to a paradigm shift in the research community's understanding of β cell:β cell communication, and determine the clinical biomarker potential of islet-derived EV cargo in diabetes."

Microbial communities and their hosts play a key role in many applications, including protecting humans or plants
against diseases or developing the next generation of biofuels and biological remediation systems needed for
sustainable growth. Gaining a deep understanding of the fundamental biology of these systems is the key to har-
nessing their potential. Advances in high-throughput multi-omics techniques like metagenomics, metatranscrip-
tomics, exometabolomics, and proteomics, allow us to capture multiple snapshots of these complex biological
processes at once. These snapshots create large-scale high-dimensional datasets of omics features (e.g., mi-
crobial species, microbial genes, proteins, and small molecules). The reduced cost has also allowed researchers
to collect more multi-omics time-series data. These temporally resolved multi-omics features can together provide
a comprehensive picture of biological processes and their underlying activities.
These well-designed multi-omics studies have not been analyzed to their fullest potential yet, primarily due to
the lack of appropriate tools and annotation databases required for such analyses. For example, systematically
investigating the time component of this longitudinal data to investigate the temporal dynamics of omics features
in relationship with disease activities is an unmet need in many studies. Therefore, there is a critical need for
statistical tools to greatly improve research infrastructure by integrating different data types and systematically
investigating the time component of this longitudinal data.
This project's overarching goal is to develop efﬁcient, interpretable, and scalable tools based on our previously
developed signal model, called partially-observed Boolean dynamical systems (POBDS), to characterize the time
component and capture the dynamical behavior of microbial communities through multi-omics data. The original
contributions can be organized across the following research goals:
(i) Developing novel methods in the POBDS context capable of modeling multi-omics data obtained through
 various molecular proﬁling technologies and various diseases/domains.
(ii) Developing Bayesian optimization frameworks for the efﬁcient and scalable reconstruction of the network
 topology of microbial communities (i.e., inferring the type of interactions between a large number of genes,
 bacteria, and microbes) through high dimensional multi-omics data.
(iii) Developing Bayesian reinforcement learning perturbation policies to decrease the number of data required
 for the modeling/learning process (overcoming the non-identiﬁability issue) and acquire the most informative
 data in microbial communities.
All the developed tools in this project will be presented in a user-friendly software/tool freely accessible to other
researchers."
10781941,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically improved the prognosis of
people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cART alone cannot eradicate the infection and,
therefore, daily treatment must be maintained for life to prevent relapse of uncontrolled viral replication and
resumption of disease progression. However, lifelong treatment entails both health risks to treated individuals
and a significant economic burden to society. As such, there is a pressing need to develop novel therapeutic
interventions to cure HIV. Since most examples of stringent, long-term, spontaneous and vaccine-associated
immune control of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection are either known, or strongly suspected
to be CD8+ T cell-mediated, therapeutic strategies designed to exploit CD8+ T cell immunity hold great promise
for achieving durable control of virus replication in the absence of cART, often referred to as a “functional cure”.
However, in most people, naturally occurring CD8+ T cell responses induced by HIV infection are often
ineffective at controlling the virus. As such, any HIV cure strategy based on enhancing CD8+ T cell immunity
would need to elicit immune responses that are qualitatively and/or quantitatively different from those that
emerge during primary infection and are subsequently maintained during cART. In addition, in the setting of cure
where the rebound-competent viral reservoir is systemically distributed, having high frequencies of effector-
differentiated and functionally potent anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses pre-positioned in sites of potential viral
rebound (even in immune privileged sites such as B cell follicles) at the time of cART cessation is likely to be
critical for achieving durable post-cART viral control. In this project, we will determine whether a therapeutic
vaccination strategy that utilizes the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccine platform RNActive,
can enhance cellular immunity in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) on cART and establish high-level, long-
term control of SIV replication after cART cessation. The choice of this vector is based on preliminary data
demonstrating RNActivevaccines with SIV gene inserts (mRNA/SIV) are highly immunogenic in RM, with the
capacity to elicit potent, systemically distributed, SIV-specific CD8+ T cells with broad epitope recognition. Here
we will assess whether mRNA/SIV vaccination alone or in combination with anti-CD20 B cell depletion (to disrupt
B cell follicles) can facilitate immediate interception of rebounding viral reservoirs to facilitate durable control of
SIV replication after cART cessation. Any finding of vaccine efficacy in this project will provide strong impetus
for clinical assessment of the RNActiveplatform in cART-suppressed HIV+ patients and potentially lead to a
clinically translatable therapeutic approach to achieve HIV infection remission off cART."
10781942,"Project Summary
Bacterial cells are extremely efficient in adapting to environmental stresses. As a prime example, they synthesize
a second messenger called ppGpp in response to starvation. Accumulation of ppGpp in bacteria arrests growth
and reprograms cellular physiology to promote survival. These effects of ppGpp is required for antibiotic
persistence that allows bacteria to survive the treatment of antibiotics to which they do not encode genetic
resistance. At molecular levels, ppGpp reprograms gene expression, and targets many other proteins involved
in translation and small-molecule metabolism. As a preliminary study, I synthesized a photo-crosslinking probe
of ppGpp and used this probe to capture and identify about 30 new ppGpp-binding proteins in E. coli. Recently,
a ppGpp riboswitch has been discovered in Gram-positive organisms. Intriguingly, E. coli transcriptome has a
rich secondary-structure landscape, but the capability of these secondary structures in binding to small-molecule
metabolite has not been explored. Therefore, in Aim 1, I will use a photo-crosslinking approach to capture binding
partners of ppGpp from E. coli transcriptome, and identify these transcripts using RNA-seq. Hit interactions will
be validated biophysically, and their putative effects on translation efficiency or the transcript stability will be
examined in vivo. Additionally, in my preliminary study, I also compared metabolite profiles in E. coli before and
shortly after ppGpp induction, and found strong perturbation of dozens of essential metabolites. This perturbation
of cellular metabolism goes much beyond known direct effects of ppGpp. It is unclear how ppGpp induction
drives the inhibition of various metabolic pathways to effectively arrest bacterial growth and promote persistence.
In Aim 2, I hypothesize that “ppGpp-sensitive” metabolites, i. e., those whose levels perturbed by ppGpp
induction, serve as a proxy of ppGpp to regulate cellular metabolism. I will seek discovering protein-metabolite
interactions responsible for this indirect effect of ppGpp. To this end, I will use time-resolved metabolomics to
identify candidate metabolites and enzymes whose levels/activities perturbed contemporaneously with ppGpp
accumulation. I will then screen for protein-metabolite interactions among these candidates using an
ultrafiltration-based assay. Briefly, I will purify each protein of interest (POI) to high homogeneity. Then, I will
subject a mixture containing a library of all candidate metabolites and a single POI to ultrafiltration. Analyzing
the filtrate using MS should reveal a decrease of the POI’s cognate ligands. I will validate any novel interactions
identified using biochemical, structural, and genetic approaches. Together, the proposed research will explore
two new aspects of ppGpp signaling, namely RNA targeting and indirect effects on cellular metabolism via
ppGpp-sensitive metabolites. This study may lead to the discovery of key regulatory interactions required for
bacterial persistence, and these interactions may serve as targets for anti-persistence drug design."

 Balance control is far more complex in walking than standing, yet has received less focus to date. As
noted in a recent joint NIDCD NIA publication [1], there is a need to better understand the mechanisms of
postural control in walking to develop effective rehabilitation strategies for individuals with vestibular disorders.
The goal of this project is to identify how the body coordinates different strategies to maintain stability while
walking and how that coordination of strategies is affected by vestibular disorders.
 Existing literature has identified four major stabilization strategies used in human walking: 1) regulating
foot placement, 2) generating ankle inversion/eversion torque to alter the lateral trajectory of the body, 3)
adjusting push-off force at the ankle, and 4) modifying trunk posture. While these strategies are actively
coordinated to retain overall stability, they have not yet all been considered simultaneously. This proposal will
investigate the interaction among all four major stabilization strategies through a combination of computational
and experimental approaches.
 A computational model of human locomotion stability will be developed and a sensitivity analysis will be
performed to investigate the influence of each stabilization strategy and the impact of vestibular inputs on
overall stability (Aim 1). This model will provide the ability to test how individual strategies contribute to overall
stability, compensate for one another, and are affected by inaccurate vestibular input. The computational
model will be validated and improved through comparison with experimental data collected in healthy adults
walking with and without physical constraints that remove individual stabilization strategies (Aim 2). Gait
analysis with individuals with unilateral vestibular hypofunction will also be performed to understand how their
reliance on specific strategies differs from healthy adults (Aim 3). This proposal will contribute to the
incomplete knowledge of balance control in walking. The ultimate goal is to identify strategies to be
emphasized in targeted rehabilitation plans to enhance stability in a population at high risk for falls (e.g. those
with vestibular disorders).
 The research described above will be completed as part of the applicant’s doctoral degree in
Bioengineering, with a focus on whole-body biomechanics. The applicant will develop knowledge in
biomechanics, neurophysiology, controls, and statistical analysis. The applicant will further her technical and
professional skills by conducting the proposed research, performing additional hands-on experiments with
human motion capture technology, and receiving mentorship from a diverse team of engineers, physicians,
and physical therapists."

American Indian (AI) youth have the highest prevalence of obesity of all ethnic groups in the United States,
placing them at disproportionate risk for adult obesity and obesity-driven metabolic disease including diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and cancer. In fact, greater than 41.7% of the children
and adolescents from the Hopi Tribe, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and
the Yavapai Apache Nation—tribal communities collaborating in the proposed study—are obese. Health
behaviors can modify obesity risk and associated morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To
enhance the impact of our efforts, we recognize the intervention must include parental support and attention to
emotional well-being and coping skills through the integration of mind-body medicine (MBM). The goal of the
Achieving American Indian Youth Energy and Mental Health Balance (AYEM-B) Study is to develop and test a
culturally-relevant, community-led intervention that incorporates the principles of MBM skills training and
parental /caregiver engagement to support AI youth in achieving healthy lifestyle choices and in reducing risk
for adult obesity and related metabolic diseases.
 Our hypothesis is that participation in a community-led intervention that includes MBM and the family will
reduce obesity-related chronic disease risk factors in AI adolescents (n=224), as assessed by changes in body
mass index z-score (primary outcome) and the objective measures of moderate/vigorous physical activity and
fruit and vegetable intake (secondary outcomes) at 6 months. We will test our hypothesis by addressing the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Integrate an existing week-long residential wellness camp program for AI adolescents with
novel MBM and parental engagement components to establish a 6-month community-led obesity prevention
intervention for AI adolescents (aged 10–15 years) and their parents/caregivers.
Specific Aim 2: Assess the preliminary efficacy of the newly established program on body mass index z-score,
physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in American Indian adolescents at baseline, 3 and 6 months
using a within-subjects design. Also, evaluate changes in individual risk factors (lipids, hemoglobin A1C,
fasting glucose) pre- and post-intervention.
Specific Aim 3: Evaluate indicators of successful program implementation and the potential for sustainability
across participating tribal communities, including acceptability and relevance to participants, parents, and the
community, and program adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and costs."

culturally-relevant, community-led intervention that incorporates the principles of MBM skills training and
parental /caregiver engagement to support AI youth in achieving healthy lifestyle choices and in reducing risk
for adult obesity and related metabolic diseases.
 Our hypothesis is that participation in a community-led intervention that includes MBM and the family will
reduce obesity-related chronic disease risk factors in AI adolescents (n=224), as assessed by changes in body
mass index z-score (primary outcome) and the objective measures of moderate/vigorous physical activity and
fruit and vegetable intake (secondary outcomes) at 6 months. We will test our hypothesis by addressing the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Integrate an existing week-long residential wellness camp program for AI adolescents with
novel MBM and parental engagement components to establish a 6-month community-led obesity prevention
intervention for AI adolescents (aged 10–15 years) and their parents/caregivers.
Specific Aim 2: Assess the preliminary efficacy of the newly established program on body mass index z-score,
physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in American Indian adolescents at baseline, 3 and 6 months
using a within-subjects design. Also, evaluate changes in individual risk factors (lipids, hemoglobin A1C,
fasting glucose) pre- and post-intervention.
Specific Aim 3: Evaluate indicators of successful program implementation and the potential for sustainability
across participating tribal communities, including acceptability and relevance to participants, parents, and the
community, and program adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and costs."

Whereas randomized trials for PD1 blockade in glioblastoma (GBM) are negative,2 a subset of these patients
do respond to immunotherapy.3 Determining the basis of response will result in immunotherapy being effectively
used for some patients. We recently reported the analysis of 66 recurrent GBM patients that were treated with
PD1 blockade.1 Whereas response was defined based on imaging criteria, responsive patients exhibited
significant increased survival that was independent of clinical characteristics or additional treatments. 30% of
tumors of responsive patients had enrichment of BRAF and PTPN11 activating mutations, which stimulate MAPK
pathway signaling.1 Therefore, molecular indicators of response to PD1 blockade for the majority of patients
remain unidentified. We performed immunohistochemistry for phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, two effectors of
this pathway. Extent of positivity for these markers was predictive of overall survival following PD1 blockade. Of
relevance to our patient tumor studies, we modeled the effect of CD8 T-cell depletion on tumor progression on
mouse transgenic gliomas that develop de novo. In this setting, CD8 T-cell depletion resulted in immunogenic
tumors that upon transplantation, preferentially engrafted in recipients with CD8 T-cell depletion as opposed to
immunocompetent hosts. Gliomas generated in the absence of CD8 T-cells showed upregulation of Braf and
Ptpn11, and associated MAPK activation indicated by phosphorylation of p38 and Erk. CD8 T-cell depletion
during glioma development also led to robust increase in tumor associated macrophages/microglia (TAM), and
gene expression of pro-inflammatory TAM. MAPK activity correlated with TAM markers in mouse transgenic
gliomas and human GBM, and with several chemokines that promote pro-inflammatory TAM. A CRISPR knock-
out screen for the kinome on intracranial gliomas also implicated MAPK in T-cell recognition of tumor cells. These
findings suggest that MAPK activity in tumor cells (that is suppressed by CD8 T-cells during glioma progression),
promotes pro-inflammatory TAM. We hypothesize that GBM with elevated MAPK signaling, are more susceptible
to CD8 T-cell recognition, as this pathway promotes anti-tumoral TAM. Thus, the subset of GBM that have MAPK
signaling are susceptible to PD1 blockade and CAR T-cell immunotherapy. To investigate this, we will SA1)
Determine the effects of CD8 T-cell depletion during glioma development on TAM phenotype. SA 2) Determine
whether MAPK signaling promotes anti-tumoral glioma TAM. SA 3) Determine the effect of modulating glioma
MAPK signaling on response to PD1 blockade and CAR T-cell therapy. We will use transgenic models in which
tumors develop de novo, cell lines with varying levels of MAPK activation, genetic MAPK manipulation as well
as clinically available drugs inhibit and/or promote MAPK signaling that cross the blood-brain barrier. Successful
execution of these studies will establish a novel immune-related role of MAPK signaling in glioma. We will
determine whether MAPK signaling by tumor cells influences response to PD1 blockade, and CAR T-cell therapy."
10895460,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Defects in mitochondria are associated with a spectrum of conditions, ranging from metabolic and degenerative
diseases to premature aging. Mitochondrial defects are also associated with multiple organ defects, including
muscular weakness, cardiac failure, diabetes, renal dysfunction, and hepatic disease. One approach to
understanding the physiopathology of mitochondrial diseases is to create animal models that enable detailed
mechanistic studies of the underlying perturbations. Drosophila is an established cost-effective model system
for studying human diseases, including mitochondrial diseases. Validation of fly models relies on two critical sets
of tools: reagents that perturb gene function and reagents that recognize proteins. While perturbation reagents
are readily available for nearly all 14,000 Drosophila genes, there are relatively few reagents for detection of fly
proteins. Our proposal focuses on generating reagents that will serve as a resource to enable the
characterization and validation of Drosophila models of human mitochondrial diseases. We will generate
two sets of reagents, based on the target gene structure, for the detection of proteins encoded by 394 high
confidence Drosophila orthologs of human mitochondrial disease genes. For Group 1 genes (Aim 1), where all
isoforms share the same C-terminus exon, we will insert a NanoTag epitope at the C-terminus of the endogenous
gene using CRISPR-based genome engineering. We selected the 3’ end to insert the tag as inserting it at the N
terminus could interfere with the mitochondrial localization signal. The resulting protein fusions can then be
recognized by an existing high-affinity nanobody against the NanoTag. For Group 2 genes (Aim 2), which
encode multiple isoforms, including some with different C-terminus exons, we will use a protein domain common
to all isoforms to screen for nanobodies. These reagents will be used together with existing RNAi transgenic
lines to validate fly models of human mitochondrial diseases (Aim 3). The resource of nanobodies and fly stocks
with NanoTags ‘knocked-in’ to endogenous genes will dramatically expand the scope of available reagents for
detection and biochemical characterization of fly mitochondrial proteins."
10788469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is critical for capturing rich, multimodal representations of experience and facilitating
the long-term storage and later recall of these experiences. During sleep and pauses in behavior, the
hippocampus can “replay” prior experience – reactivating the neural ensemble corresponding to the
original experience in a time-compressed manner. During sleep, such replay is thought to underlie
memory consolidation, while during behavior, replay is thought to additionally serve a more prospective
role: contributing to planning or deliberation by retrieving stored memories in order to inform upcoming
decisions. However, the content of replay neither solely reflects recent experience nor reliably predicts
future behavior, leaving it unclear how exactly the representations of experience that are replayed relate
to upcoming choices. Understanding the relationship between replay and behavior is particularly critical
because abnormalities in replay and sharp wave ripples (SWRs; the network activity signature of replay)
have been observed concurrent with impaired memory-dependent behavior in aging and diseases of
aging. Establishing how replay content changes with aging, and whether these changes cause deficits in
memory-guided behavior, has the potential to generate new therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse
memory impairment. In order to define how replay contributes to memory-guided decision-making in
normal cognition and in the context of age-related memory impairment, we have developed a
neurofeedback-based operant conditioning paradigm that targets SWRs. This paradigm provides rapid
feedback contingent upon real-time detection of SWRs at a specific point during each trial of a spatial
memory task, and results in substantially increased occurrence of SWRs in a trial phase- specific manner.
Consequently, subjects experience more replay at the required trial phase, which occurs immediately
prior to the choice point of a memory-dependent task. In addition to demonstrating that replay can be
enhanced by neurofeedback, this behavioral paradigm provides an increased opportunity to link the
content of replay with subsequent behavior. This paradigm lays the foundation for the three aims of this
proposal: to define the relationship between replay and memory-guided behavior, to assess how this
relationship changes with age, and to adapt the operant conditioning strategy to directly counter age-
related replay dysfunction. I will complete these aims with the guidance of an exceptional mentoring team
led by Loren Frank and including Carol Barnes, Uri Eden, and Karunesh Ganguly. During the mentored
phase of the award at UCSF, I will conduct the proposed real-time feedback studies, gain expertise in
using state-space models to capture and quantify replay content, scale experiments to efficiently examine
larger cohorts of young and aged animals, and focus on professional development in order to facilitate a
successful transition into an independent faculty position at an academic institution."
10763001,"Eukaryotic genomes exist in a complex and dynamic 3-dimensional structure that provides important regulatory
information controlling gene expression programs essential for the maintenance of cell identity. Genome
structure is also critical for packaging the genome in the nucleus and preserving genome stability. Genome
structure is primarily dictated by its' association with the histone proteins to form chromatin. The post-
translational modifications on histones play a key role in determining genome structure as they regulate the
association of non-histone proteins with genomic DNA. An important challenge for eukaryotes is the
epigenetic inheritance of the histone modification patterns that govern genome structure following DNA
replication and cell division. This proposal seeks to identify fundamental mechanisms that regulate the
epigenetic inheritance of histone modification patterns.
Following passage of a replication fork, newly replicated DNA is packaged into chromatin that contains a 1:1
mixture of parental histones and newly synthesized histones. The retention of modification patterns on
parental histones provides the spatial memory for the duplication of specific chromatin states. The key step in
epigenetic inheritance is the transfer of the parental modification patterns to the neighboring new histones.
Our work is based on the hypothesis that the new histones play a critical regulatory role in the epigenetic
inheritance of chromatin states. The current proposal is based on my lab's identification of previously unknown
links between the dynamic acetylation of newly synthesized histones and the epigenetic inheritance of specific
chromatin states and the restoration of 3-dimensional genome architecture following DNA replication. The
experiments proposed here will characterize the effect of new histone acetylation on the structure and
composition of chromatin and identify factors and pathways that function with new histone acetylation to
regulate the epigenetic inheritance of chromatin states. In addition, we will characterize a previously
unanticipated role of new histone acetylation in the epigenetic inheritance of 3-dimensional genome
architecture through regulation of the interactions between chromatin and the nuclear lamina."

Smallpox (caused by variola virus infection) was one of the most destructive diseases in human history,
resulting in 300-500 million deaths in the twentieth century alone until it was finally eradicated in 1980.
Following elimination of variola virus, global vaccination programs were eventually halted and as a result, most
of the world’s population is no longer immunologically protected from smallpox nor does it enjoy cross-
protection to other orthopoxviruses. There are two drugs approved for smallpox disease, however, both
compounds possess significant limitations. A lack of therapeutic options for treating orthopoxvirus infections
continues to expose the population to grave risk from a smallpox bioweapon as well as future zoonotic
orthopoxvirus infections. During the course of the Phase I funding period, we will execute a hit finding
campaign against a library of >200,000 compounds with optimal drug-like properties. Quality hits that emerge
from the assay will be subjected to follow-on testing that will investigate the potency, selectivity, and
mechanism of action. The most interesting of these compounds will be subjected to medicinal chemistry driven
hit-to-lead to explore structure-activity relationships (SAR). The overall goal of this project is to discover one or
more novel lead series which is defined as a chemotype inhibitor that demonstrates tractable SAR, potent
antiviral activity against variola virus and other orthopoxviruses with minimal cytotoxicity. Success in these
endeavors will trigger the submission of a Phase II application that will advance the program from Early Lead
Optimization through to Candidate Selection."
10763396,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Serious illness is a condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either negatively impacts a person’s daily
function or excessively strains their caregivers. Serious illness affects an estimated 12 million US adults.
Structural racism and racial/ethnic residential segregation may affect serious illness outcomes by 1. limiting
access to palliative care, the specialty focused on improving quality of life for persons with serious illness and
their families and 2. limiting the capacity of family caregivers to engage with the healthcare system. Caregivers
are critical for this population because they assist with complex decision making, care coordination and patient
advocacy. Structural racism refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through
mutually reinforcing systems (such as housing, education, employment, and healthcare) that ultimately affect
health outcomes. Such institutions include healthcare systems, whose internal cultures may affect care delivery
and patient outcomes differentially by race and ethnicity. Few studies have attempted to highlight racism’s impact
on caregivers. To address this gap, we propose a population-based, multi-level, mixed-methods study within
and across the state of Massachusetts, a diverse state with large limited-resource communities and a population
that includes ~30% persons of color (POC). Focusing on a single state allows for in-depth investigation across
communities that vary in racial composition and resources, as well as across hospital systems that vary in terms
of size, profit status and academic affiliation. In Aim 1 we propose a quantitative analysis that will describe
neighborhood-level burden of serious illness, access to hospital-based palliative care, availability of caregiver
resources, and their impact on individual-level health outcomes. Data from the All Payer Claims Database will
characterize neighborhood-level rates of serious illness and access to palliative care (travel time), and individual-
level health care utilization (hospitalization, palliative care use, length of stay, ICU stay) and health outcomes
(in-hospital death). Mediation analysis with linked data on neighborhood-level caregiver-related resources from
the American Community Survey will identify the effect of neighborhood-level caregiver resources on
outcomes. We hypothesize that poorer access to care, measured as longer travel time to hospitals, will more
negatively affect POC from neighborhoods with fewer caregiver resources. In Aim 2 we conduct qualitative case
studies of hospitals to characterize how hospital cultures support or constrain caregiver engagement for persons
with serious illness from different POC communities. We will conduct n=8 in-depth case studies to characterize
institutional cultures of caregiver engagement. In Aim 3 we convene community, content, and policy experts to
synthesize quantitative and qualitative results to produce culturally appropriate hospital recommendations and
actionable policy solutions to improve equity in caregiver engagement for serious illness. Disentangling the
relationships between segregation, neighborhood deprivation, and healthcare utilization in serious illness will
help us show that racism, not mistrust, is a primary barrier to equitable care and health outcomes."
10770519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Influenza virus is a significant pathogen in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, including lung allograft
recipients. Moreover, compared to other SOT, lung allograft recipients have more severe influenza disease.
However, due to requisite immunosuppression, these individuals respond poorly to standard-dose (SD)
inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Recent studies have investigated two strategies to overcome poor immune
responses in SOT recipients: (1) administration of high-dose (HD)-IIV compared to SD-IIV and (2) two doses of
SD-IIV compared to one dose of SD-IIV in the same influenza season. The first study, conducted in adult SOT
recipients, reported that HD-IIV was safe and more immunogenic; however, the median post-transplant period
was 38 months. The second study, another phase II trial in adult SOT recipients with a median post-transplant
period of 18 months, reported that two doses of SD-IIV administered one month apart was more immunogenic
than one-dose of SD-IIV. While promising, these studies lack evaluation in the early post-transplant period,
when SOT patients are most vulnerable to influenza. Moreover, these studies had limited inclusion of lung
transplant recipients, a population that is most at risk for influenza-related comorbidities, including respiratory
failure, acute cellular rejection, and chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Finally, the administration of two doses
of HD-IIV in the same influenza season has not previously been evaluated in SOT recipients. Thus, the optimal
immunization strategy for lung allograft recipients in the early post-transplant period remains unknown. In
addition, the immunologic predictors and correlates of influenza vaccine immunogenicity in lung allograft
recipients have not been well-defined. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that lung allograft
recipients who are 1-35 months post-transplant and receiving two doses of HD-quadrivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) will have higher HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) to influenza
antigens compared to those receiving two doses of SD-QIV. To test this hypothesis and address the
critical knowledge gaps outlined above, we propose to conduct a phase II, multi-center, randomized-controlled
immunogenicity and safety trial comparing two doses HD-QIV to two doses SD-QIV administered one month
apart in lung allograft recipients who are ≥16 years and 1-35 months post-transplant. This study will be
conducted at five lung transplant centers—Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Duke University,
Northwestern University, University of Alabama in Birmingham, and University of Washington. The results of
this study will illuminate immune responses in adult lung allograft recipients and help guide vaccine
recommendations during the early post-transplant period. Moreover, our findings may help guide optimal
vaccine strategies in other immunosuppressed populations."

 The proposed project serves as a platform to obtain the key training and research experiences in
achieving the long-term career goal of becoming a leading academic principal investigator with a primary focus
of developing and applying genomic methods to understand the complex genetic components and biological
mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders.
 Chromosomal aberrations in the form of large deletions or duplications (copy number variants, CNVs),
such as those on 1q21.1, 16p11.2, and 22q11.2, are the strongest known risk factors for neuropsychiatric
disorders. For this reason, these large CNVs serve as key points of entry for investigating the molecular
etiology. However, it is unknown why each of these CNVs is associated with diverse clinical outcomes. For
example, deletions and duplications at 16p11.2 are strong risk factors for schizophrenia (SZ) and autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). Duplications produce a greater than 10-fold increase in risk for SZ, but ASD is
frequent in carriers of deletions as well as duplications. The large stretches of human-specific segmental
duplications (HSDs) that both constitute and mediate the formation of these large “neuropsychiatric” CNVs are
inaccessible to current genome sequencing analysis due to their high degree of repetitiveness and complexity.
CNV studies to date have not been able to consider the genetic variations inside these hundreds of kilobases
to megabases of HSDs. Thus, we do not know the exact “genomic scar” of each CNV in individual carriers
including additional smaller-scale rearrangements, gene fusions, and copy number changes of paralogs, the
diversity HSD rearrangements across different CNV carriers, and the concomitant functional effects.
 The major aims here are to (1) develop generalizable genome analysis methods to solve this important
problem in psychiatric genetics in established cell lines carrying the 16p11.2 deletions and duplications as the
first targets of this new approach, (2) to develop high-throughput genotyping assays so that studying the
diversity of HSD rearrangements can be applied to expanded groups of affected individuals where only DNA
sample (no cell lines) is available and to future cohort association studies, and (3) to investigate the functional
effects of HSD rearrangement diversity on CNV biology using cortical organoid models.
 To facilitate career development and transition to an independent investigator, the following five training
goals will be achieved under the support and guidance of the mentorship team: (1) developing expertise in
targeted genome assembly analysis and optical DNA mapping; (2) expanding knowledge in developmental
neuroscience and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders; (3) gaining hands-on expertise in neuronal
organoid modelling (4) acquiring expertise in chromatin interaction analysis and single-cell RNA expression
analysis of neural organoids; (5) gaining experience in grant writing. The hands-on training will primarily take
place at Stanford University with training components conducted at Yale and KU Leuven."

Durable immunity to cancer is sustained by memory T cells. In contrast to circulating memory subsets, which
traffic in and out of the blood, tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells are transcriptionally programed for prolonged
residence and recall function within tissue. Collaborative studies between our laboratories were among the first
to identify a requirement for TRM cells in immunity to cancer. Using a melanoma-associated vitiligo (MAV) mouse
model that closely mimics the vitiligo that develops in immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated melanoma patients
who benefit from prolonged disease-free survival, we showed that skin TRM cells are necessary and sufficient for
long term protective immunity against melanoma in the dermis. However, mechanisms for controlling TRM cell
persistence and identity as well as the contribution of TRM cells to tumor immunity at sites of frequent metastasis
remain unclear. In this application, we examine an unexpected mechanism for TRM cell maintenance in the skin
and reveal a new subset of vitally important TRM cells that persist in tumor-draining lymph nodes.
In the skin of mice with MAV, as well as melanoma patients with vitiligo, immunofluorescent imaging revealed
that TRM cells form lymphoid aggregates containing large populations of CD11c-expressing myeloid cells. While
prior work indicates that CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for initiating immune responses but dispensable
for reactivating TRM we find that depletion of CD11c-expressing cells results in rapid disaggregation and loss of
CD8 TRM cells in the skin. We further show that the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis is required for TRM cell persistence and
tumor protection in the skin. These findings identify a critical requirement for CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells
in coordinating the organization and retention of CXCR6-expressing TRM in the tissue, which will be examined in
Specific Aim 1. The importance of the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis and persisting self antigen in controlling TRM cell
function and plasticity will be tested in Specific Aim 2. Finally, parallel mechanisms will be explored in lymph
nodes (LNs) where our preliminary studies led us to discover a novel population of tumor-specific T cells that is
crucial for protection against melanoma growth in lymph nodes. The presence of LN TRM cells has not previously
been shown in the setting of cancer. A role for APCs and chemokines in maintaining such responses is
essentially unknown, and will be the focus of Specific Aim 3. This proposal will thus test the overarching
hypothesis that tumor-specific TRM cells— both in skin and draining lymph nodes—rely on key interactions with
APCs and chemokines for their proper positioning, maintenance, and anti-tumor function."

Bacteria alternate between a free-swimming lifestyle and existing in sessile communities known as biofilms. The
biofilm lifecycle consists of three stages: founder cell attachment, biofilm maturation, and dispersal. The global
pathogen Vibrio cholerae forms biofilms during infection and biofilm dispersal is critical for disease transmission.
While the components facilitating V. cholerae biofilm formation are defined, almost nothing is known about V.
cholerae biofilm dispersal. I developed a real-time microscopy approach that permits examination of the entire
biofilm lifecycle, including dispersal, in V. cholerae. Using this imaging technique and high-content genetic
screening, I have identified and begun characterizing components required for V. cholerae biofilm dispersal;
signal transduction proteins, matrix disassembling enzymes, and motility functions that promote biofilm exit. Now,
my overarching goal is to define the signaling mechanisms that coordinate biofilm dispersal in space and time at
single-cell resolution. Regarding signal transduction components, the mutant with the most extreme biofilm
dispersal-failure phenotype from my screen is defective in a wholly uncharacterized two-component regulatory
system. This circuit is composed of a sensor that I named DbfS (for Dispersal of Biofilm Sensor), a response
regulator that I named DbfR (for Dispersal of Biofilm Regulator), and a small secreted protein of no known
function, VC1637, that is encoded in the dbfS-dbfR operon and controls DbfS activity. In addition, my genetic
analyses show that a second, unknown, sensor kinase must exist and phosphorylate DbfR. I propose a model
in which two sensors, regulated by different stimuli, converge on DbfR to control V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. I
will use the tools of microscopy, bacterial genetics, proteomics, biochemistry, and biophysics theory to: (Aim 1)
determine how DbfR integrates information from two sensors to control biofilm dispersal; (Aim 2) define how the
small protein, VC1637, controls biofilm dispersal; (Aim 3) determine how biofilm dispersal occurs at the single-
cell level. The proposed research will reveal how dispersal is coordinated in V. cholerae by defining the
molecular-level signaling events, impinging on individual cells, that lead to population-wide exit from biofilms.
Moreover, this work could reveal targets that can be manipulated to activate biofilm dispersal, possibly guiding
development of treatments that reduce the duration of V. cholerae infection. My K99 training will be completed
under the guidance of my mentor Professor Bonnie Bassler at Princeton University where I am immersed in a
vibrant intellectual environment. I have enlisted the support of several collaborators who are experts in topics
that are wholly new to me, such as proteomics and biophysical theory. In addition, I plan to further my growth
through participation in microbiology conferences, attendance of courses in proteomics, biophysics, and lab
management, and by partaking in scientific writing workshops. By the start of the R00 phase, the knowledge that
I will have gained, combined with my existing expertise, will enable me to achieve my career goal of being an
independent academic researcher tackling fundamental problems in biology."

The Administrative Core is the driver for the planning and coordination of all activities within the University of
North Carolina Superfund Research Program (UNC-SRP). It ensures that the research aligns with our
overarching mission-to develop new solutions for iAs reduction and disease prevention through
mechanistic and translational research. The role of the Administrative Core is to oversee and facilitate the
conduct of work within the UNC-SRP to ensure responsiveness to the SRP mandates. In addition to fulfilling
mandates of the SRP program, we implement research that is in line with the 2018-2023 NIEHS Strategic Plan.
This Core oversees the nine other components of the UNC-SRP. Projects 1-3 use highly translational techniques
spanning in vitro and in vivo models, and human populations to understand mechanisms of iA-induced metabolic
dysfunction/diabetes. Projects 4-5 advance the ability to predict iAs contamination in private drinking wells and
innovative methods for enhanced removal to reduce iAs. Across Projects, we use a translational approach that
spans in vitro models and cell culture, mouse models, and human samples. Four Cores include the Community
Engagement Core, Data management and Analysis Core (DMAC), Research Experience and Training
Coordination Core (RETCC), and Chemistry and Analytical Core (CAC). The UNC-SRP Director is Dr. Rebecca
Fry, a Biomedical Researcher, who is supported in this role by Deputy Director Dr. Fernando Pardo-Manuel de
Villena (Biomedical Researcher) and Assistant Director, Dr. Michael Aitken (Environmental Engineer). Drs. Fry,
Pardo-Manuel de Villana and Aitken have extensive experience with administration and oversight of large
research efforts, established leadership in successful mentoring, and complementary scientific expertise relevant
to the proposal. Their interdisciplinary expertise and experience contributes significantly to the goal of the
Administrative Core is to foster an environment that stimulates innovative science and ensures that all UNC-
SRP Projects and Cores work toward the overarching theme, “Identifying novel methods to reduce iAs exposure
and elucidating mechanisms underlying iAs-induced metabolic dysfunction with a vision for disease prevention.”
The goal of the Core is achieved through four aims. First, we integrate, coordinate, and monitor UNC-SRP
interdisciplinary research activities focused on iAs reduction and metabolic disease/diabetes prevention.
Second, we convene advisory groups to provide critical guidance on UNC-SRP activities. Third, we develop
effective research translation and communication strategies for UNC-SRP stakeholders related to iAs reduction
and disease prevention. Finally, we provide training and career development opportunities for graduate students
and post-doctoral fellows that foster integration across the Biomedical and Environmental Science research
areas. Combined, these aims ensure a thriving research program bolstered by substantive interaction with
translation and community engagement partners, collectively focusing the UNC-SRP to achieve our mission.

The UNC-SRP Community Engagement Core (CEC) collaborates with two community-serving organizations—
Clean Water for North Carolina and the Winyah Rivers Foundation—to understand the needs of well users in
four North Carolina counties related to inorganic arsenic (iAs) contamination of well water. The overarching
goal of the CEC is to foster environmental health literacy in the context of well water contamination.
Drawing on the strengths of all collaborators, we jointly develop prevention and intervention strategies that
reduce exposure to toxic metals in drinking water. The CEC accomplishes its goal through three aims. First, we
facilitate dialogue among UNC-SRP investigators and key NC stakeholders about SRP research and its
implications for reducing exposure to iAs in well water by convening a Public Health Action Committee. This
committee stimulates bi-directional communication that will inform the development of responsive environmental
health sciences research and community problem-solving strategies. Second, we enhance understanding of iAs
exposures in high-risk communities and encourage well testing and filter deployment as local strategies to
prevent or reduce harmful exposures. Working with investigators in Project 4, the CEC and community partners
will identify high-risk areas as well as the need for additional sampling. We will assist residents in understanding
sampling protocols, results, potential risks of exposure, and actions they can take to reduce exposure. Project 5
also supports these efforts, with deployment of novel filters. Third, we inform the development of local and state
policies that prevent or reduce iAs exposure in private wells used for drinking water. Working with policy experts,
including staff of the Center for Environmental Health, and the UNC-SRP Research Translation Coordinator, we
will identify policy options for reducing iAs exposure in well water and convene decision makers to discuss
implications of recommended policies. Through these aims, CEC activities are directly relevant to the mission of
the UNC-SRP and are responsive to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Mandate 4,
promoting methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances. The bi-directional
communication resulting from active engagement of the UNC-SRP researchers with PHAC members and
community partners fosters creative thinking that will inform locally-relevant solutions to the challenges posed
by toxic metals contamination of well water in NC."
10781889,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Formation of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) is an early step in the development of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). Serum ACPA are highly predictive of developing RA and can directly promote joint damage. Yet,
there remains a major gap in our understanding of ACPA development, including where and how they are
initially triggered. Importantly, to achieve the NIH's mission of disease/disability prevention in RA, an improved
understanding of the initiating factors and pathways that lead to ACPA is needed as these factors/pathways
would be novel targets for RA prevention. ACPA originate several years prior to the onset of arthritis in RA, and
data support that they may initially develop in the lung mucosa. However, the mechanism by which the lung
contributes to ACPA development is unclear. The overall hypothesis of the proposed project is that neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs) in the lung trigger ACPA and predict RA. This hypothesis is based on our published
and preliminary data including our finding that NET remnants correlate with ACPA in the lung in subjects At-
Risk for developing RA. Importantly, NET remnants are a composite of NET formation (NETosis) and NET
clearance. This study will establish whether aberrancies in one or both of these processes contribute to ACPA
generation in the lung and development of RA. In this project, induced sputum will be collected from subjects
who are At-Risk for RA (based on known familial or serologic risk factors), healthy controls and subjects with
RA. Using microscopy, the percentage of sputum neutrophils that undergo NETosis following cytokine
stimulation will be calculated. The binding of serum ACPA to proteins on sputum NETs will also be measured.
It is expected that subjects At-Risk for RA will have abnormally increased sputum NETosis following cytokine
stimulation compared to controls. It is also expected that cytokine-induced sputum NETosis will correlate with
sputum ACPA levels and that sputum NETs will express citrullinated proteins that bind serum ACPA from At-
Risk subjects. The proposed project will also measure the degradation of NETs by DNase in sputum and the
clearance of NETs by sputum macrophage phagocytosis. It is expected that both mechanisms of NET
degradation and clearance will be decreased in subjects At-Risk for RA compared to controls and will correlate
with sputum ACPA. In addition, At-Risk subjects will be followed for 3 years. Sputum ACPA and NET remnant
levels will be measured at baseline and yearly to establish the ability of sputum NET remnants to predict which
At-Risk subjects will develop RA. Mass spectrometry will also be used to identify citrullinated proteins present
in sputum that are associated with development of RA. It is expected that increased sputum NET remnants
mediated through sputum ACPA and unique cit-proteins will predict imminent RA in subjects At-Risk for RA.
Ultimately, these findings can lead to novel approaches for RA prevention that target specific mechanisms of
ACPA development (e.g. NET formation and clearance) at the site of initial immune dysregulation (e.g. the
lung) in individuals who are At-Risk for RA."

Pain-related stigma is a significant and understudied psychosocial factor among adolescents with chronic
widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWMP) that has been implicated in impaired health outcomes. The
subjectivity of pain self-report increases the opportunity for an individual to experience symptom disbelief by
others. Pain-related stigma is a significant public-health priority due to its potential impact on delayed diagnosis
and impairment in recovery. Adolescents with CWMP are vulnerable to pain-related stigma from several
sources, including physicians, school staff, family, and peers, likely impacting their health. The objectives of
this proposal are to: 1) examine how pain-related stigma is a novel and necessary psychosocial component of
adolescent CWMP, and 2) develop and validate the Pain-Related Stigma Scale for Adolescents (PReSS-A) in
patients with CWMP. Not enough is known about pain-related stigma in this young population. This proposal
uses a mixed-methods design to develop a theoretical framework in new areas of psychosocial research for
adolescents with CWMP. This research will provide a foundation for understanding pain-related stigma and
developing interventions to target this social construct in adolescents with CWMP. The specific aims are: 1)
develop a pain-related stigma framework and PReSS-A items using separate focus groups of adolescents with
CWMP and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and their parents; 2) refine PReSS-A items using classical item
analyses in a sample of adolescents with CWMP; 3) validate final PReSS-A items in a larger sample of
adolescents with CWMP, and test construct validity using a comparative sample of adolescents with JIA, who
are hypothesized to report less stigma due to the medical evidence supporting their JIA diagnosis; and 4)
leverage structural equation modeling to explore relationships between perceived pain-related stigma and
psychosocial and health outcomes. The use of multiple patient populations (i.e., CWMP and JIA) and their
parents to examine and validate a measure of this social construct is innovative. This career-development
award is designed to allow Dr. Emily Wakefield, a pediatric psychologist in the Division of Pain and Palliative
Medicine at Connecticut Children's Medical Center and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of
Connecticut School of Medicine, to draw upon ample resources of both institutions to become an independent
researcher dedicated to improving health outcomes for adolescents with chronic pain. Her short-term goal is to
understand mechanisms contributing to pain-related stigma and develop interventions focused on reducing this
stigma in adolescents with CWMP. To achieve this, the career-development plan includes formal and informal
training, mentorship and consultation in both qualitative and quantitative research design, and advanced
training on statistical analyses, pediatric pain, stigma, and randomized clinical trials. Her long-term goals are to
be a national leader in psychosocial research on pediatric chronic pain and an expert on adolescent pain-
related psychosocial health outcomes."

The monogenic, monoallelic, and seemingly stochastic transcriptional choice of one out of > 1000 olfactory
receptor (OR) genes remained elusive for decades after the discovery of the largest mammalian gene family.
However, in the past few years we obtained significant understanding on the molecular underpinnings of this
enigmatic gene regulatory process. Specifically, we showed that OR gene clusters become heterochromatic at
the early stages of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) differentiation and then they aggregate in distinct nuclear
compartments that assure their stable repression. As a result of this interchromosomal convergence, intergenic
OR enhancers (known as Greek Islands) that are found in most OR gene clusters come in close nuclear
proximity and form a multi-chromosomal super-enhancer that in each OSN associates with the transcriptionally
active OR allele. The formation of the Greek Island hub is dependent upon the recruitment of the adaptor
protein Ldb1, which is essential for the stable interchromosomal interactions between Greek Islands and for
OR transcription. This intricate network of activating and repressive interchromosomal interactions, together
with a feedback signal elicited by the expression of the chosen OR, likely generate the regulatory framework
for transcriptional singularity. However, what remains unknown how this seemingly stochastic process
operates under deterministic restrictions related to the spatial location of the OSN along the dorso-ventral and
apico-basal axes of the MOE. These restrictions, known as zonal pattern of OR expression, restrict the
expression of each OR gene in one of five zones of expression. Here we identified putative mechanisms of
zonal restriction, by uncovering the molecular mechanisms that enable only zone 5 ORs to be expressed in
zone 5. We show that transcription factors of the NFI family enable the transcriptional activation of zone 5 ORs,
by mediating the recruitment of these ORs to the interchromosomal OR compartment. Moreover, we show that
the repressive histone modification H3K79me3 prevents the expression of out of zone ORs, possibly under the
control of NFI factors, as well. We propose experiments that will decipher which NFI factors are required and
sufficient for specification of zone 5 transcription programs, and experiment that will determine how NFI
proteins accomplish these zonal restrictions. Our experiments will reveal novel mechanisms of regulation of
nuclear architecture, and will uncover generally applicable principles for the regulation of developmental
patterning."

 Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects about 40,000 births per year (1%) in the United States. Estimates
indicate that over 1 million children and 1.4 million adults with CHD are living in the United States. This project
speciﬁcally aims to develop and clinically evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to assess car-
diovascular hemodynamics in pediatric CHD patients, when imaging is most needed.
 Individuals born with CHD require a lifetime of clinical care, especially during surgical planning and repair.
This includes monitoring and/or serial interventions that mandate multiple echocardiography, CT, or MRI exams.
Under most circumstances, MRI is the clinically preferred imaging modality for these patients owing to soft tissue
contrast, clear depiction of complex anatomies, capability to quantify cardiac function, and the lack of ionizing
radiation. Moreover, the ability to acquire 3D+time ﬂow encoded (“4D-Flow”) MRI exams that depict and measure
blood ﬂow dynamics is an increasingly impactful clinical tool in adult patients, but several challenges persist in
pediatric patients.
 Current pediatric cardiovascular 4D-Flow exams are slow to acquire (⇡20-min with moderate spatial and tem-
poral resolution), have unacceptable ﬂow measurement accuracy and precision (oftentimes >20%), can have
long reconstruction times (several hours), and have inadequate clinical robustness (>10% of exams with unac-
ceptable image quality). These are unacceptable clinical limitations that interfere with clinical care. To overcome
these limitations, we have planned three speciﬁc aims to develop our Hyper 4D-Flow MRI exam. [AIM-1] To
enable fast, accurate, and robust image acquisitions with Hyper 4D-Flow. [AIM-2] To enable fast and accurate
image reconstructions of Hyper 4D-Flow. [AIM-3] To demonstrate the diagnostic value of “push-button” Hyper
4D-Flow in pediatric patients with CHD.
 Successful completion of the proposed speciﬁc aims will make available a validated, “push-button”, multi-
vendor deployable Hyper 4D-Flow MRI exam that enables fast (5-min scan time and 30-min reconstruction),
accurate (<5% bias), precise (95%-CIs<5%), and robust measurements (>95% of exams with diagnostic image
quality; no need for post-acquisition corrections of background phase-induced errors) of blood ﬂow. This compre-
hensive approach to the problem will improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical conﬁdence in decision making for
pediatric patients with CHD patients, by providing fast, accurate, and robust evaluation of hemodynamics."
10775866,"Genomic bases for African geo-ethnic prostate cancer health disparity
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With no known cause or modifiable risk factor, prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by significant geo-ethnic
disparity. Men of African ancestry and/or from Africa are at greatest risk for aggressive disease. Compared to
non-Africans, African American men are at 2.5 to 5-fold increased risk for lethality. Here we will address if this
geo-ethnic disparity is driven by ethnicity (genetics), geography (environment), or a combination. Our approach
is to use the power of whole tumor/blood genome interrogation to identify contributing genetic and non-genetic
factors. Genetic factors include from inherited rare pathogenic mutations to tissue acquired cancer drivers.
Conversely, non-genetic factors such as environmental carcinogens, leave a computationally derived pattern of
somatic variants (mutational signatures) in the developing tumor. Additionally, the mostly discarded non-human
prostate genomic data holds unmet potential to identify contributing pathogens (bacterial or viruses) to a cancer
featured by chronic inflammation. However, PCa whole genome data is lacking across the African diaspora.
While much work in ethnic associated PCa health disparity has addressed the contribution of factors from
common germline variants to socioeconomics, these studies have almost exclusively been limited to the United
States and remain under debate. Globally, lethal PCa is exasperated in African ancestral regions, including Sub-
Saharan Africa and South America with rates 2.5 and 1.6-fold greater than the United States, respectively. Our
working hypothesis is that global inclusion provides a unique opportunity to correlate for ethnic and geographic
similarities and differences, with men of African ancestry presenting with the greatest genetic diversity, while
also representing regions of significant environmental diversity. While the benefits of diversity and inclusion for
enhancing genomic medicine are well understood, the benefits to bolster scientific knowledge has been less
appreciated. In 2022, this team generated the first African ancestral PCa whole genome data, providing insights
ranging from novel African-specific cancer drivers, identifying a larger spectrum of somatic mutational signatures,
while describing a clinically relevant African-specific molecular taxonomy. Our study provided the first tantalizing
evidence for both ethnic and geographic contributions to African ancestral PCa health disparities.
Here we will expand this preliminary work to include African ancestral populations from the US (Chicago), Brazil
and South Africa. Through whole genome profiling of 700 men and their tumors, we will identify African-relevant
inherited pathogenic variants and cancer drivers, including germline-somatic interactions; identify non-genetic
signatures within the complex tumor genome through somatic variant pattern recognition with associated
geography over ethnicity, including our newly described Global Mutational Subtyping; while we will harness the
power of shotgun genomic interrogation to provide novel insights into the potential role of infectious pathogens.
Ultimately, identifying the underlying causes of PCa health disparities has significant implications for advancing
our understanding of the etiology, early detection, prevention, and treatment of lethal PCa for all men."

Immunotherapies, including those that involve immune checkpoint inhibitors against programmed death-ligand
1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, in stark contrast to
other malignancies such as melanoma or renal cell cancer, immunotherapies against ovarian cancer have been
largely ineffective. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) appears to dysregulate key pathways important for anti-tumor
immune responsiveness in ovarian cancer and several lines of evidence may explain the minimal success of an
immunotherapy approach. Elevated levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in ovarian cancer blood samples,
compared to normal subjects, have been previously observed. We also unexpectedly found that SPHK1
co-localized and associated with extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, we also
have data suggesting extracellular S1P signaling activates PD-L1 expression and inhibits cytotoxic T cell action.
Encouraging immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells is essential to develop an immunotherapy
against ovarian cancer and requires a detailed understanding of how SPHK1-packaged EV dysregulates
immune response in the tumor microenvironment, for which little is known.
This proposal seeks to test the central hypothesis that tumor cells employ EVs to deliver SPHK1 to the tumor
microenvironment, facilitating extracellular S1P maturation. Subsequent S1P signaling promotes
E2F1-mediated transcription of PD-L1, causing immune suppression and tumor proliferation. We will assess this
model by performing the following three specific aims: (1) Dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying SPHK1
packaging into extracellular vesicles and their effect on extracellular S1P maturation. (2) Delineate the
mechanism whereby S1P signaling promotes immune cell inactivation in ovarian cancer. (3) Define the role of
SPHK1-packaged extracellular vesicles in ovarian cancer progression.
We expect this project will elucidate a novel mechanism by which S1P and SPHK1 promote immune evasion by
high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells. We also anticipate that these studies will determine whether SPHK1 or
S1P can serve as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy targets PD-L1/PD-1 proteins. Furthermore, we
expect SPHK1 inhibition will lower PD-L1 levels and synergize PD-1 blockade for making immunotherapy
possible for ovarian cancer."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of
upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total
paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of
the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our
knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in
the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How
subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated
behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic
inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics
catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using
a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting
cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and
intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching
hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs
in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use
spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from
patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have
previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within
subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon
our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in
the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous
exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to
measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between
data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi-
omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging
to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an
unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such
interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives
upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS."

Human cancer is a dynamic disease that develops over an extended time period through the accumulation of a
series of genetic alterations. Delineating the system dynamics of disease progression can significantly advance
our understanding of tumor biology, and lay a critical foundation for the development of improved cancer
diagnostics, prognostics and targeted therapeutics. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through
time-course studies achieved by repeated sampling of the same cohort of subjects across an entire biological
process. However, due to ethical and economic constraints, it is not feasible to collect time-series data to study
human cancer, and typically we can only obtain profile data from excised tumor tissues. Consequently, while
major efforts continue to reveal the genomic events associated with human cancer, to date, it has been difficult
to put the identified changes in the context of the dynamic disease process. With the rapid development of
sequencing technology, many thousands of static tumor samples are being collected in large-scale cancer
studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data,
instead of time-course data, to study disease dynamics. Built logically on our previous work, we propose a
large-scale interdisciplinary research plan to develop a series of novel methods that enable the construction of
high-resolution cancer progression models by using massive static data, the identification of pivotal molecular
events that drive stepwise disease progression, and the visualization of identified changes in a cancer
development roadmap. If successfully implemented, this work can effectively overcome the existing sampling
limitations, and open a new avenue of research to study cancer dynamics by using vast tissue archive, instead
of performing resource-intensive or impractical time-course studies. The developed methods will be intensively
tested on 27 breast cancer datasets comprised of ~9,000 samples. To our knowledge, no prior work has been
performed on this scale to study breast cancer dynamics. The analysis will result in the first working model of
breast cancer progression constructed by incorporating all genetic information. The constructed model can
provide a foundation for the visualization of key progressive molecular events and facilitate the identification of
pivotal driver genes and pathways and potential points of susceptibility for therapeutic intervention. Moreover,
interrogation of the constructed model will enable us to test novel hypotheses in silico and to prioritize
resources for more focused and detailed investigations experimentally. We expect that our work will have a
broad impact. Although in this study we focus mainly on breast cancer, the developed methods can also be
used to study other cancers and other human progressive diseases, where the lack of time-series data to study
system dynamics is a ubiquitous problem."

African-Americans have disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US. African-Americans
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have twice the risk than non-Hispanic whites for developing CVD. Poorer sleep
and greater chronic psychological stress may contribute to this additional risk. Consequently, African-
Americans have worse glycemic control among those with diabetes and higher CVD risk. One promising
approach to improving CVD risk in African-Americans is mindfulness meditation (MM). MM can potentially
reduce cardiovascular risk through attention control, emotional regulation, and self-awareness. The overall
purpose of this K01 training grant is for Dr. Alana Biggers to obtain research training and develop skills needed
to become an independent investigator, and use those skills to adapt and evaluate an established MM
curriculum (Mindfulness Based Therapy for Insomnia, or MBT-I). The specific aims are to: (1) adapt and refine
the MBT-I curriculum for African-Americans with T2DM and incorporate text messaging; (2) conduct an 8-
week, pilot randomized, controlled trial of the adapted curriculum with 68 African-Americans with T2DM; and
(3) explore the impact of the intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, glycosylated
hemoglobin, and lipid profile) and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor
necrosis factor α). Primary outcomes will include sleep quality and perceived stress evaluated at baseline, 8,
and 16 weeks. The proposed research design consists of a pilot study, utilizes mixed-methods research, and
involves both primary data collection and analysis. This K01 training grant will provide Dr. Biggers career-
building activities to further develop skills and a knowledge base in quantitative and qualitative methodology,
health disparities research, and mobile health (mHealth)/behavioral health strategies in minority populations.
With the guidance of an interdisciplinary mentorship team and institutional support, Dr. Biggers will receive the
necessary assistance and training to work toward her long-term career goal of being an independent
researcher with expertise in health disparities, mixed-methods, and mHealth behavioral research."

circuits in auditory cortex that subserve cortical representations of biologically important sounds. We will use
the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as our experimental model to investigate these questions.
Marmosets have a hearing range similar to that of humans and are an ideal model system for studying audition
and deficits and diseases in hearing. With the recent progress in creating transgenic marmosets, this model
system is poised to become a major non-human primate model for hearing research. Our laboratory has
pioneered major neural recording techniques in awake and behaving marmosets. In this application, we will
focus on elucidating neural coding mechanisms underlying spatial and harmonic processing in non-primary
auditory cortex. Aim 1 will characterize functional properties of parabelt areas of auditory cortex. Aim 2 will
study cortical organization of spatial information. Aim 3 will study topographic organization of harmonic
processing in marmoset auditory cortex. Findings from the proposed study will shed lights on neural
mechanisms responsible for hearing and have implications for understanding how the auditory system
operates in normal or diseased conditions."
10771956,"Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is currently the third leading cause of cancer related to death in the USA with a 5-
year survival rate of <5%. Most potentially curable patients present with unresectable locally advanced
disease where the standard of care includes a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A major
challenge in the management of pancreatic cancer is the early assessment of treatment response. Novel
markers of early treatment response are critically needed to make better informed decisions regarding the type
and sequencing of therapies, given the high toxicity associated with these treatments. In our previous work we
were able to identify 20+ exosomal protein markers from the serum of patients with locally advanced pancreatic
cancer during therapeutic treatment by using exosome isolation methods and mass spectrometry analysis.
However, such analysis for large clinical cohorts was limited by the reproducibility in exosome preparation for
accurate quantification of exosomal proteins, which is a significant problem in the exosome omics research field.
In the current proposal, we plan to develop the analytics of exosome isolation and characterization with a focus
on rigor and reproducibility. We will develop a super-SILAC-based (Stable Isotope Labeling by/with Amino
acids in Cell culture) exosome method as a universal internal standard (UIS). In principle, when the super-SILAC-
based exosome is spiked into human serum for proteomic analysis it can follow the same experimental workflow
as serum exosomes which could maximally reduce variations introduced by sample preparation and LC-MS
(Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spec) analysis. Therefore, SILAC-labeled exosomes will be ideal with a dual
function for biomarker analysis for reproducible sample preparation and acting as a UIS. Targeted LC-SRM and
PRISM-SRM exosome analyses of markers from our prior studies will be used with the UIS to precisely monitor
changes in proteins during a course of chemo-radiation therapy. Patients with locally advanced pancreatic
cancer will undergo serial blood draws prior to, during, and after treatment with chemotherapy followed by
chemo-radiation. We will then perform a targeted proteomics confirmation study based on exosome markers
identified in our previous work that have a specific response to a course of chemo-radiation therapy. The marker
value changes compared to baseline will be associated with the treatment outcomes (such as progression-free
survival and overall survival) in patients. This work will establish the potential use and measurement
reproducibility of these exosomal markers for monitoring changes in protein markers during and after treatment.
The LC-SRM mass spec-based assay to be used herein has the distinct advantage of being multiplexed for over
20 markers simultaneously. The proposed work contains several novel aspects including: 1) the use of super-
SILAC to address irreproducibility in accurate quantification of exosome proteins especially for multi-step
exosome preparation and 2) multiplexed targeted LC-SRM and highly sensitive PRISM-SRM assays for
biomarker analysis in patient serum exosomes."
10771974,"The Kv2.1 K+ channel is the most abundantly expressed and widely distributed voltage-gated K+ channel in
mammals. Our previous research demonstrates that in addition to functioning as a delayed rectifier K+ channel
and regulating plasma membrane potential, a non-conducting, majority population of Kv2.1 forms endoplasmic
reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) contact sites. In hippocampal neurons Kv2.1 channel binding to the
cortical endoplasmic reticulum generates micron-sized Kv2.1 clusters on the surface of the soma, proximal
dendrites and axon initial segment. Data in the literature indicate that ER/PM junctions regulate neuronal burst
firing, the non-vesicular lipid transfer directly from the ER to the cell surface, and plasma membrane PIP2 levels.
Our preliminary data show that the Kv2.1-induced ER/PM junctions, but not other ER/PM junctions, alter ER
Ca2+ homeostasis, plasma membrane organization, and exocytosis. Interestingly, Kv2.1 interaction with the
cortical ER is regulated by neuronal activity and stroke-like insults such as hypoxia, ischemia and excess
glutamate, indicating that the functions linked to these microdomains are remodeled following hyperactivity or
neuronal insult. Thus, the proposed research examines a novel non-conducting function of Kv2.1 that 1) is
central to neuronal physiology and 2) is regulated by neuronal activity, insult and stroke. The three
Specific Aims will address the molecular mechanisms by which Kv2.1 alters ER Ca2+ homeostasis and
membrane protein localization at somatic ER/PM junctions and exocytosis at presynaptic ER/PM contacts. Aim
1. To test the hypothesis that Kv2.1-induced ER/PM contact sites enhance store-operated Ca2+ entry by
providing localized K+ conductance. Preliminary data suggest that ER Ca2+ refilling is enhanced in neurons
expressing Kv2.1. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that the concerted action of Kv2.1 and cortical actin
controls the localization of Ca2+ signaling proteins in the vicinity of ER/PM junctions. Preliminary data
indicate Kv2.1-induced ER/PM junctions influence the cell surface distribution of Cav1.2, BK K+ channels and b2
adrenergic receptors. Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that synaptic vesicle exocytosis is modulated by Kv2.1
channels at the ER/PM junction in presynaptic terminals. Preliminary data demonstrate that both
endogenous and transfected Kv2.1 is localized at presynaptic terminals and that shRNA-based knockdown of
Kv2.1 suppresses glutamatergic vesicle exocytosis by 50% without affecting the action potential. While Kv2.1
point mutations that cause human epileptic encephalopathy alter channel conductance, a subset of point mutants
that are linked to developmental delay induce premature stop codons in the channel C-terminus that should not
affect conductance. Instead, these mutations are predicted to only prevent Kv2.1 binding to the cortical ER.
Thus, mutations affecting both the conductance and cortical ER remodeling roles of Kv2.1 underlie human
disease. The research in this proposal will substantially advance our understanding of the role that Kv2.1-
containing ER/PM contact sites play in neuronal physiology."
10884424,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Viral infection outcomes are sex-biased, with males generally more susceptible to human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) and other viral infections compared to females. These differences may reflect sexual dimorphism in
immune cell composition and function. As such, it is surprising that numbers of natural killer (NK) cells, a first
line of defense against HCMV, are increased in males compared to females. Here we show in mouse models
and human samples that while males harbor increased NK cell numbers, they produce less IFN-γ, a critical pro-
inflammatory cytokine for NK-mediated anti-viral responses. This difference is not due to divergent levels of
gonadal hormones, since these differences are still present in gonadectomized mice. Instead, a screen for X
chromosome genes that escape inactivation and demonstrate sexually dimorphic expression in NK cells
identified UTX, an epigenetic regulator that alters transcriptional programs through reorganization of chromatin.
NK cell-specific UTX deletion phenocopies multiple features of male NK cells, which include increased NK
numbers and reduced IFN-γ production. Thus, we hypothesize that NK cell sex differences can be attributed to
differential expression of X-linked UTX, which reorganizes chromatin at loci important in NK cell fitness and
function. In Aim 1, we will define UTX-mediated temporal control of NK cell numbers and determine whether
differences in cellular fitness underlie differences in NK cell homeostasis in males compared to females. In Aim
2, we will delineate UTX’s role in promoting NK cell cytotoxic activity and whether lower UTX levels in male NK
cells also impairs their cytotoxic capacity. In Aim 3, we will delineate molecular mechanisms by which UTX
controls chromatin accessibility and gene expression at loci important for NK cell homeostasis and function.
Knowledge gained from completion of these studies will contribute to our basic understanding of sex differences
in anti-viral responses and NK cells. A deeper understanding of sex differences will benefit human health overall
by revealing new targets for immunotherapy and guiding interventions for optimizing anti-viral immunity."
10899510,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Ccr4-Not complex is the major regulator of codon optimality-mediated messenger RNA decay, a
mechanism that is intimately tied to translation rate. The disruption of co-translational mRNA decay events can
have major physiological effects, leading to haploinsufficiency or contributing to cancer. For instance, CNOT3,
a subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex, was recently identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in 7.9% of
adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). Recent work in our lab identified that Not5 (yeast
homolog of human CNOT3) directly binds to the E-site of slowly translating ribosomes, leading to the
preferential decay of non-optimal mRNA transcripts. This interaction was recently found to be conserved in
humans, suggesting a mechanism for how cells use the mRNA decay machinery to alter transcript levels.
Though the structure of Not5 interacting with elongating ribosomes has been resolved, nothing is currently
known about how Not5 interacts with members of the Ccr4-Not complex to facilitate mRNA decay. Thus,
teasing apart how the decay machinery mechanistically regulates the degradation of mRNA will be critical in
understanding how cells regulate transcript levels as well as open avenues of therapeutic intervention for a
broad range of haploinsufficiency diseases and cancer. To address this gap in knowledge, I will
mechanistically dissect how the Ccr4-Not complex assembles onto actively translating ribosomes and assess
how the subunits of this complex coordinate the removal of the poly-A tail and 5’-cap of mRNAs using the
budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Preliminary data from our lab shows that Not5
binding to the ribosomal E-site is necessary for the recruitment of the mRNA decay factor, Dhh1, to translating
ribosomes, but the details of this recruitment pathway remain opaque. We do not yet understand if Not5 is
involved in the recruitment of the remaining mRNA decay factors and how this recruitment might coordinate
decay events. Likewise, the loss Dhh1 is known to exhibit decapping defects and recently we found that the
loss of this factor also exhibits defects in pol-A tail removal of mRNAs, meaning Dhh1 recruitment may serve to
bridge these 3’-5’ decay events. I hypothesize that Not5 recruits the remaining Ccr4-Not subunits to
actively translating ribosomes resulting in the timely decay of mRNA transcripts. I will address this
hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1) I will systematically determine the assembly of the Ccr4-
Not complex subunits onto the translating mRNP structure and determine if this assembly is Not5-
dependent. Aim 2) I will characterize the contacts between Dhh1 and the Ccr4-Not complex to determine if
their interaction mediates the 3’-5’ communication of mRNA decay. The proposed studies will enhance our
mechanistic insight into how mRNA half-lives are regulated and provide the basis for detailed understanding of
this role in human disease."

Psychosocial stress has been well-documented to correlate with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares
and poor SLE outcomes. How this occurs has not been well studied. We recently identified that psychosocial
stress induces circulating IL6 produced by Adrb3-expressing brown adipocytes. Brown adipocyte-derived IL6
mediates immunometabolic reprogramming through hepatic IL6 signaling to support “fight or flight” responses
to acute stress. We have generated preliminary data that chronic psychosocial stress may enhance mortality in
murine models of SLE through this novel Adrb3/IL6 pathway. Here, we propose to dissect the role of the
Adrb3/IL6 pathway in the impact of psychosocial stress on SLE pathogenesis in murine models. In addition to
gaining biological insight into how psychosocial stress leads to increased immune activation in lupus, our
studies would provide compelling pre-clinical data for potential human translation."
10752704,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) affects at least 50% of people who sustain a traumatic joint injury such as
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, with symptomatic joint pain typically developing within 1-2 decades
following injury. Modulating joint loading (exercise/walking) or unloading (rest/disuse) in the early phase (<7
days) following injury could be used to decrease inflammation and catabolic processes that initiate PTOA.
However, there is currently no clinical consensus on recommendations for joint loading or unloading during the
early phase, and the effect of post-injury loading/unloading on joint degeneration has never been
mechanistically investigated. The overall goal of this research is to determine how biomechanical interventions
can be utilized following joint injury to affect the initiation and progression of PTOA. The proposed studies will
use a clinically relevant injury model (non-invasive, mechanically-induced ACL rupture in mice) and clinically
relevant post-injury conditions (mechanical unloading of the injured limb, intermittent reloading, surgical
restabilization of the joint) to determine the effect of biomechanical therapies for slowing PTOA progression
after injury. We hypothesize that unloading following injury will reduce inflammation, protease activity, and
mechanical damage in the joint during the early post-injury phase, and that mitigation of these early processes
will change the trajectory of PTOA progression relative to normally loaded joints. We further hypothesize that
muscle and bone atrophy associated with unloading will be ameliorated with intermittent reloading without
leading to joint degeneration, and that surgical restabilization of the knee following one week of unloading will
further reduce long-term joint degeneration, while restabilization following one week of normal loading will not
be as effective for changing the trajectory of PTOA. We will first determine the effect of mechanical unloading
during the early phase on inflammatory and catabolic processes and long-term joint degeneration. Next, we will
determine the effect of intermittent reloading on muscle mass and strength, subchondral bone structure, and
long-term joint degeneration. Finally, we will determine the effect of surgical restabilization of the knee
following normal activity or mechanical unloading during the early phase on long-term joint degeneration.
These studies will determine if unloading and other biomechanical treatments during the early post-injury
phase “pause” PTOA development (i.e., delay but do not prevent long-term joint degeneration), or if they are
able to diminish long-term joint degeneration. These studies will allow us to individually evaluate the effects of
joint unloading, intermittent reloading, and surgical joint restabilization following injury, and will provide
mechanistic insights into biomechanical interventions that will inform subsequent clinical studies, potentially
leading to optimization of therapeutic strategies for preserving long-term joint health of patients following injury."

 My ultimate career goal is to become an independent scientist researching the genetic mechanisms
of Mendelian disorders in hopes of improving patient therapeutics. Specifically, I am focused on disease
gene discovery in familial cohorts, which remains one of the most effective means by which to study normal-
tension glaucoma (NTG). Glaucoma describes a group of ocular conditions characterized by the
progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that comprise the optic nerve and is present
in 1-3% of the adult population. Traditional therapies have focused on lowering intraocular pressure
(IOP), the largest modifiable risk factor. However, a subset of individuals with NTG – a diagnosis which
accounts for nearly one-third of all glaucoma cases and denotes optic atrophy despite an IOP that is within
normal range – continue to show disease progression after IOP-lowering treatment. A critical barrier to
developing new treatments is understanding the molecular pathogenesis of NTG. To this end, our group
identified a pedigree with autosomal dominant NTG that is poorly responsive to IOP-lowering therapy.
Linkage, whole-exome, and whole-genome analyses revealed that there is likely more than one risk allele
of high effect segregating in individual family members, though the vast majority of cases seem to be
explained by a very rare missense substitution at a highly conserved residue in scaffolding/chaperone
protein RPAP3. This variant, with high in silico pathogenicity scores, is predicted to disrupt the N-terminal
domain of the protein. The N-terminal domain is critical for stimulating the ATPase activity of HSP90,
another scaffolding/chaperone protein that modulates the production of extracellular matrix (ECM)
components. Further, RNA-seq from familial blood samples revealed that ECM-associated genes were
among the most dysregulated in a differential gene expression analysis. These observations support
the hypothesis that disruptions in the N-terminus of RPAP3 impair HSP90 regulation, leading to defects
in ECM production/maintenance. This could result in normal-tension glaucoma by compromising key
optic nerve-supporting structures like the lamina cribrosa. My proposal seeks to: (i) determine the functional
consequences of RPAP3 coding variants on HSP90 interaction/stimulation and ECM gene expression,
(ii) determine the prevalence of deleterious RPAP3 variants in a cohort of patients diagnosed with glaucoma,
and (iii) elucidate additional glaucoma risk variants segregating in this large family. The results may lead to
improved screening and treatment options for NTG patients. By carrying out these aims, I will also
broaden my skillset in disease gene discovery and functional characterization of genetic variants, poising me
for a career focused on human disease genetics and molecular diagnostics."

Binge alcohol drinking is a risk factor for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and while alcohol use and AUD
diagnoses are more prevalent in men than women, this gap has drastically narrowed. Promising therapeutic
candidates for the treatment of AUD have been identified using rodent models; however, few studies have
addressed sex as a biological variable (SABV). Increasing our understanding of SABV in the neural circuitry
that underlies binge-like drinking could lead to more tailored interventions. The nucleus accumbens core
(NAcc) has diverse afferent connections that underlie its crucial involvement in all stages of AUD. In treatment
resistant male patients with AUD, NAcc deep-brain stimulation reduced alcohol craving and promoted either
lower alcohol intake or total abstinence, underscoring the relevance of this brain region in translational AUD
research. In rodents, ethanol (EtOH) drinking increases c-Fos (a biomarker for neuronal activity) in the NAc,
and manipulations of the NAc (via lesion, DBS, or chemogenetics) changes EtOH drinking. Lesioning the NAcc
in male DBA/2J mice prevents acquisition of EtOH conditioned place preference (CPP), a measure of
sensitivity to the rewarding effects of EtOH. Since there are some known sex-differences in the rodent NAcc,
both basally and in response to EtOH, it is imperative to address SABV in studies testing the importance of the
NAcc in EtOH reward and AUD. There are apparent sex differences in EtOH Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) intake
following chemogenetic manipulation of the NAcc, where inhibition reduces intake in C57BL/6J (B6) males but
increases intake in females. Conversely, stimulation of the NAcc reduces DID EtOH intake in females, with no
effect seen in males. These findings suggest that NAcc manipulation may alter sensitivity to the rewarding
effects of EtOH in a sex-dependent manner, and if so, this could underlie chemogenetically-induced changes
in drinking. Overall, this proposal addresses the importance of the NAcc and SABV in B6 mice during 2
facets of binge/intoxication – 1) how changing NAcc activity impacts the positive subjective effects of
an intoxicating dose of EtOH and 2) determining the NAcc circuitry engaged during binge-like drinking.
Aim 1 tests whether chemogenetic manipulation of the NAcc alters the conditioned rewarding effects of EtOH
using an EtOH conditioned place preference (CPP) task. Aim 2 uses whole-brain imaging to identify regions
engaged during DID (through analysis of c-Fos expression), in combination with use of a viral retrograde tracer
administered into the NAcc. This will allow for quantification of co-labeled c-Fos and GFP-expressing NAcc
inputs to determine which NAcc circuits are engaged during this behavior. Inclusion of both sexes allows us to
determine whether there are differences in c-fos induction, and whether projections to the NAcc are
differentially engaged during DID. The proposed studies will critically improve our understanding of 1) how
NAcc activity may sex-specifically impact the rewarding effects of EtOH, and 2) whole brain and NAcc specific
circuits engaged by binge-like EtOH drinking in males and females."

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a debilitating T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the large intestine with an
incidence that now rivals that of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but has no FDA-approved therapies.
Emerging evidence supports that MC occurs due to an inappropriate immune response to environmentally-
induced disturbances in the luminal microenvironment. Diet is a critical regulator of the luminal microenvironment
through alteration in gut epithelial integrity, microbiome composition and function, and immune cell activation.
Yet, its role in the pathogenesis of MC remains unknown. Two dietary patterns, the Empiric Dietary Inflammatory
Pattern (EDIP) and the Mediterranean diet, are of particular interest in MC pathogenesis due to their associations
with changes in downstream metabolites, including short chain fatty acids, sphingolipids, and tryptophan
metabolites, that have a plausible mechanistic basis in MC and a known role in the pathogenesis of other models
of colitis. Furthermore, these dietary patterns and downstream metabolic pathways are associated with 1)
systemic inflammatory markers known to be elevated in MC, and 2) incidence, disease activity, and treatment
response of other IBD. Accordingly, our overarching hypothesis is that specific metabolic pathways,
influenced by diet, impact risk of incident disease and treatment outcomes in MC. To test this hypothesis,
we will first examine the associations between derived dietary patterns, EDIP and modified Mediterranean diet
(Aim 1a), and their individual components (Aim 1b) and risk of MC within three population-based cohorts, the
Nurses’ Health Studies and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Second, within these cohorts we will evaluate
the association between plasma metabolites and risk of MC (Aim 2a), and determine if metabolites mediate the
associations between diet and MC (Aim 2b). Third, we will evaluate metabolites that predict therapeutic response
in a prospective cohort of individuals with incident MC at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We anticipate
this work will provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of MC, offering the basis for novel dietary therapies
for MC in the future. Further, it will promote the career development of a junior faculty gastroenterologist at MGH
with the long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-investigator, focused on defining the
etiopathogenesis of disease to inform preventive strategies and treatment algorithms that enhance patient
outcomes. To achieve this goal, this proposal builds on the candidate’s background in epidemiology to provide
focused training in nutritional epidemiology, analysis of metabolomic data to understand implicated biological
pathways, and prospective cohort development. The candidate will thrive with the support of 1) a renowned
mentorship team with expertise in MC, nutritional epidemiology, and metabolomics, 2) experiential and formal
didactic training, and 3) the outstanding scientific environment of the MGH Clinical and Translational
Epidemiology Unit, Harvard School of Public Health, and Broad Institute. By the completion of this award, the
candidate will demonstrate the scientific independence and preliminary data for a successful R01 application."

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease that is characterized by loss of oligodendrocytes in the brain. A
potential therapeutic angle for MS is through the increased differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
(OPCs) into oligodendrocytes. Increasing differentiation of OPCs is a viable therapeutic option because they are
a stem cell population that is found in the adult brain with the ability to differentiate, albeit typically at lower rates
than needed to alleviate the symptoms of MS. Different labs have conducted high throughput screens to identify
novel small molecules that lead to increased OPC differentiation. In work from our lab, we identified a unifying
mechanism of the hits from these screens. Each small molecule inhibited one of three steps within the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway, which we then identified the accumulation of the 8,9 unsaturated sterols from these steps
as being the mechanism of action. Our lab has evaluated the accumulation of different sterols and the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway for other novel targets. In this proposal, we plan to elucidate different targets within the
cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and evaluate potential mechanisms by which these sterols enhance
oligodendrocyte formation. In Aim 1, we have developed tools and small molecules to target previously
overlooked enzymes within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, SC4MOL, NSDHL, and HSD17B7. Potential
inhibition of these three enzymes would similarly lead to accumulation of 8,9-unsaturated sterols. Therefore, we
hypothesize that these enzymes provide additional therapeutic targets. In Aim 2, we propose that two parallel
pathways within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway have unique effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation. In
Aim 3, we have identified two potential signaling mechanisms in which 8,9-unsaturated sterols promote OPC
differentiation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have been done to determine different downstream
signaling pathways by which these 8,9-unsaturated sterols act through to promote OPC differentiation. Two
different signaling pathways have been implicated, and this proposal evaluates whether they are the mechanism.
Taken together, the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide key new findings in the search and
development of remyelinating therapeutics. Both new targets (Aim 1 and 2) and the mechanism of these sterols
(Aim 3) will provide a more complete picture and potential therapeutic strategies to target OPCs to repopulate
oligodendrocytes in the brain."

Myocardial infarction is the most common form of acute cardiac injury attributing to heart failure. While there
have been significant advances in current therapies, mortality and morbidity remain high. In response to cardiac
injury, macrophages are recruited in high numbers to the infarcted myocardium and act to control the initiation,
maintenance, and resolution of the inflammatory response. Blood-derived and tissue-resident macrophages
exhibit the unique characteristic to phenotypically switch between a pro-and anti-inflammatory phenotype
producing a sequential spectrum of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors exerting both pro-and anti-
inflammatory effects. Despite this understanding, much remains to be learned about the plasticity of
macrophages during tissue repair and the factors that regulate macrophage function. The regulatory potential of
circular RNAs (circRNA) in cardiovascular disease has begun to garner interest as a largely unexplored topic.
Circular RNAs are newly discovered non-coding RNA generated from protein-coding genes ubiquitously
expressed in mammalian tissue, highly conserved among species, and recently implicated in the possible
regulation of macrophage activation. However, there are currently no reports on the role of circRNAs in
macrophage biology and function during cardiac ischemia. Our central hypothesis is that circRNA may modulate
monocyte/macrophage biology during cardiac injury and therapeutically regulate post-injury cardiac
inflammation. Preliminary data identified circRNAs differentially expressed in pro-and anti-inflammatory
macrophages, including circRNA CDR1as (circ-CDR1as). This project aims to determine the specific role of circ-
CDR1as in the promotion of monocyte/macrophage class switching and how circ-CDR1as modulates the
functions of monocytes post-cardiac injury. Further, we plan to test the efficacy of circ-CDR1as for cardiac
repair in vivo using a mouse MI model by loss/gain of function approaches. Lastly, investigate the mechanism
by which circular circ-CDR1as invokes physiological changes in macrophages in both the steady-state and
injured heart. Collectively, our goal is to identify and establish the role of circ-CDR1as as a potential therapeutic
for the resolution of inflammation after cardiac injury to promote cardiac repair and remodeling."

The development of therapeutic drugs to cure obesity has not been successful due to unwanted side effects
and limited efficacy. Delineation of key brain neural pathways on body weight regulation is essential to fully
understand the pathophysiology of obesity and to design an effective strategy against obesity. Given the rapid
obesity epidemic coinciding with recent economic development and readily availability of high fat high caloric
diet (HFD), it is well accepted that the increased HFD consumption contribute significantly to human obesity
development. Compelling human studies also indicate a profound effect of stress on body weight regulation.
However, little is known about the neural basis of stress and HFD induced obesity. The major brain neurons
that respond to stressors are corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which are located in a few major
brain sites including the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). PVH CRH neurons help maintain bodily
homeostasis in response to stressors mainly through hormonal hypothalamus-pituitary axis (HPA) and direct
projections to down-stream neurons known to be involved in behavioral adaptation.
Our previous results demonstrate that clamping PVH CRH neuron activity at either high or low levels both
leads to reduced neuron responsiveness and exacerbates high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO), which is
associated with altered blood corticosteroid diurnal rhythms. Importantly, PVH CRH neuron responsiveness is
dramatically reduced by HFD feeding, which is known to blunt HPA axis rhythmicity. In addition, body weight-
reducing variable stress regimes in rodents augment PVH CRH responsiveness. Emerging studies also
suggest that PVH CRH neuron responsiveness changes in response to reward and regulates choices on HFD
intake. These observations lead to our central hypothesis that PVH CRH neuron responsiveness underlies
HFD-induced obesity. Experiments in Aim 1 will determine the mechanism underlying reduced PVH CRH
neuron responsiveness by HFD. Experiments in Aim 2 will identify the neurotransmitters that mediate the PVH
CRH neuron effect in DIO with a focus on CRH and glutamate release. Experiments in Aim 3 will test whether
PVH CRH neuron responsiveness mediates the known beneficial effects on metabolism induced by time-
restricted feeding and circadian rhythm enhancing Nobiletin treatment.
Results will fill in the knowledge gap in understanding the neural basis for integrating stress and HFD on
obesity. Given the growing evidence on the impact of chronic stress in human obesity, this proposal aiming to
identify PVH CRH neuron responsiveness as a fundamental mechanism for DIO is highly relevant to human
obesity and significant for obesity treatment."

attended by ~900 basic and clinical researchers, teachers, and undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral trainees, from universities, medical schools, research
institutes, and clinics in the U.S. and more than 30 other countries. The three-fold goals
of every meeting are (1) to present state-of-the-art research in the biology underlying
and associated with reproduction, fertility, and development; (2) to provide an
environment that encourages scientific dialogue, collaboration, and innovation and (3) to
provide a meeting program, setting, and culture that promotes inclusiveness and
professional development of trainees and early-stage investigators. Each meeting
consists of plenary and state-of-the-art lectures by world-class scientists, and 20-25
concurrent sessions (with 2-4 speakers in each) over 3 and a half days that focus on
subjects of interest to scientists in biomedical, clinical, and veterinary and animal
science, as well as those who concentrate on wildlife conservation. Oral and poster
presentations (typically 50-100 and 500-600, respectively) highlight research
contributions by scientists from a range of career stages, but with a special focus on
trainees and early career investigators. These presentations are selected from
submitted abstracts, based on quality review by the Program Committee. Abstracts
submitted for trainee award competitions also are reviewed by the SSR's Awards
Committee. This grant application is a renewal of our longstanding SSR annual meeting

10903974,"With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases are ubiquitous regulators of cation chloride cotransport. Disease-causing
mutations of these kinases cause salt-sensitive hypertension, hyperkalemia, and type IV renal tubular acidosis,
indicating their importance in kidney tubular function. Despite advances in our understanding of the WNK
signaling pathway, fundamental questions remain. The most significant knowledge gap concerns the mechanism
by which WNK kinases are activated by cell volume changes. Recently, we reported that the “Long” kinase-
active form of WNK1 (L-WNK1) activates within biomolecular condensates during hypertonic cell shrinkage.
These membraneless liquid-like assemblies form via phase separation, induced by macromolecular crowding.
This process bypasses the inhibitory effects of increased intracellular chloride caused by exosmosis, rapidly
triggering net ion influx and volume recovery. The importance of protein phase behavior in WNK signaling is
further supported by our work in distal convoluted tubule (DCT). In this nephron segment, KS-WNK1, a truncated
WNK1 isoform that likely functions as a scaffold for phase transitions, drives the formation of specialized
biomolecular condensates termed WNK bodies. These structures form in the DCT during hypokalemia, and their
presence correlates with the phosphorylation-dependent activation of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter
NCC. This suggests a relationship between extracellular K+ sensing, WNK phase behavior, and distal nephron
salt handling. Here, we will test the hypothesis that WNK kinases undergo phase transitions to respond to their
environment and amplify ion transport. Aim 1 will determine how phosphorylation-dependent charge switching
of the L-WNK1 C-terminus activates ion flux and volume recovery. Aim 2 will investigate how intracellular chloride
and crowding-induced phase separation interact to control WNK activity. Aim 3 will determine if DCT WNK body
condensates are necessary for NCC activation, and whether disrupting WNK bodies reverses Familial
Hyperkalemic Hypertension. This proposal combines the complementary expertise of two leaders in the WNK
signaling field. The MPIs will use a multifaceted and innovative approach that includes mouse models of altered
WNK body function, newly developed live cell imaging methods, and Drosophila Malpighian tubule, a tractable
and genetically malleable model of the nephron. The discovery that WNK kinases function as physiological
crowding sensors marks a conceptual advance that has enabled fresh thinking and logical testable hypotheses,
viewed through the lens of condensate biology. Thus, we expect that the knowledge gained from these studies
will transform our understanding of epithelial cell volume regulation and ion transport, while testing the functional
contributions of biomolecular condensates to kidney physiology and disease."

Infections of the lung significantly impact health worldwide, with non-tuberculosis lower respiratory infections
causing 2.7 million deaths annually and chronic infections significantly contributing to impaired lung function and
morbidity. Pulmonary macrophages are critical, front-line mediators of host protection against helminth parasites,
fungi, and viruses. Despite the well-defined role of lung macrophages as crucial initiators of immunity to diverse
sets of pathogens, our understanding of the cellular and molecular events that regulate macrophage responses
in the lung remain poorly defined. For example, the precise mechanisms that allow pulmonary macrophages to
eliminate both intracellular and extracellular pathogens while simultaneously mitigating tissue injury and
preserving lung function remain elusive. Further, an emerging body of literature has now revealed that
macrophage populations in the lung are more heterogeneous than originally appreciated. Specifically, it is now
understood that alveolar macrophages present in the lung can originate from embryonic precursors (tissue-
derived alveolar macrophages-TD-AMs) or from blood monocytes (monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages-
Mo-AMs). Despite this important advance, it is currently unclear whether these ontologically distinct pulmonary
macrophage populations perform comparable or distinct functions in mediating protection (reduction in pathogen
burdens and/or maintenance of tissue integrity). Also, whether these distinct macrophage populations initiate
similar or unique effector functions in the context of helminth, fungal, or viral challenges remains unknown.
Finally, our understanding of how a previous exposure to one pulmonary pathogen alters the responsiveness of
lung macrophages to a subsequent challenge with a distinct pathogen is poorly understood. This important gap
in knowledge has become extremely evident during the COVID-19 pandemic where individual outcomes vary
dramatically and we have a poor understanding of how one’s infectious past may contribute to these differences.
The leaders of this project will employ their combined expertise to address these critical questions. The central
hypothesis of this application is that infection with diverse pathogens program TD-AMs and Mo-AMs to perform
distinct functions against heterologous pathogens while mitigating tissue injury. We further hypothesize that the
pathogen-induced response of TD-AMs and Mo-AMs is critically shaped by neutrophil-derived signals and type
I and III interferons. In three distinct and complementary aims we will use a combination of discovery-based
studies combined with targeted in vitro and in vivo approaches to define the overlapping and unique contributions
of tissue-derived macrophages and recruited monocyte-derived cells to host protective responses following
helminth, fungal or viral infections. This thorough and comprehensive approach will allow us to gain an
unprecedented understanding of fundamental innate immune functions. This novel insight may inform
therapeutic strategies to target lung macrophage populations in a manner that will allow for the fine tuning of
inflammation and pulmonary infection outcomes."
10756969,"ABSTRACTPreclinical and clinical evidence has shown that brain tumors can alter the structure and function of the
central nervous system microvasculature (i.e. CNS vasculome) during progression, therapy and the emergence of
therapeutic resistance. Brain tumor progression related vasculome remodeling occurs via angiogenesis (i.e. new blood
vessel formation). In contrast, non-angiogenic pathways such as ‘co-option’ (i.e. tumor cells hijacking extant blood
vessels) and ‘immunomodulation’ (i.e. vascular changes induced by the infiltration of immune cells) are involved in
antiangiogenic resistance and immunotherapy evasion, respectively. To elucidate the role of these angiogenic and non-
angiogenic pathways on brain tumor progression and therapeutic response necessitates the development of imaging
tools that can characterize early to advanced in vivo changes in the CNS vasculome (i.e. over the lifetime of the disease).
Therefore, our goal is to build a wireless ‘plug-n-play’ multichannel microscope capable of imaging structural/functional
microvascular (~7-10 µm) changes in vivo, over the entire lifetime of a brain tumor. We propose to exploit advances in
miniaturized optics, image sensor design and wireless technology to fabricate a miniature, wireless microscope with
three channels: fluorescence (FL) to image fluorescent brain tumor cells or dyes; intrinsic optical signals (IOS) to image
cerebral blood volume (CBV) and intravascular oxygenation (HbSat); and laser speckle contrast (LSC) to image cerebral
blood flow (CBF). Guided by compelling preliminary data, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: (1) Develop a
tether-free multichannel microscope with on-chip compressed sensing and wireless transmission; (2) Characterize the in
vivo vasculome in angiogenic and co-optive patient-derived (PDX) brain tumor models over their lifetime; and
(3) Characterize in vivo changes in the vasculome induced by the immune microenvironment of brain tumors. Under
Aim1 we will fabricate a specialized image sensor with compressed sensing for ultra-low power wireless operation. After
validation against an equivalent benchtop imaging system, we will image the CNS vasculome in healthy mice without the
confounding effects of anesthetics. This will include identifying microvessel type (i.e. artery vs. vein) with FL, quantifying
vascular morphology and HbSat with IOS, perfusion with LSC, and mapping ‘microvascular connectivity’ by correlating
CBV (or CBF) fluctuations in microvessels. Under Aim2 we will characterize differences in the CNS vasculomes of clinically
relevant angiogenic and co-optive patient-derived xenografts, and assess if the former exhibits larger disruptions in
microvascular connectivity due to vascular remodeling. Under Aim3, we will characterize in vivo differences in the CNS
vasculomes of wild-type and non-immunosuppressed xenografts, to determine if alleviating immunosuppression
increases CBV/CBF/HbSat and promotes recruitment of tumor associated macrophages (TAM). We will create a versatile
3D printed plug-n-play wireless microscope that permits neuroimaging in freely behaving animals at any time, for any
duration, during any task or physiological recording (e.g. EEG). As this microscope can be customized to any fluorophore,
modified for optogenetics or drug delivery, and used for behavioral studies, we believe it will usher in a new era of brain
cancer research, with utility in diseases involving the CNS vasculome (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer’s disease)."

Kenya remains one of the countries in the world with high HIV disease burden with approximately 1.6 million
Kenyans living with HIV, and 46,000 new infections annually. Though appreciable progress has been made
towards epidemic control, impact is patchy: the incidence of new HIV infections, HIV-related mortality, and
severe illness remain unacceptably high. More than 75% of financing for HIV prevention and treatment
activities is through external donor funds. From the earliest onset of the HIV epidemic, the University of
Nairobi has played an important role in the prevention and control of the HIV epidemic through basic,
translational, clinical, and implementation research. However, most of the research projects have been led
by international collaborators with fewer local faculty and scientists originating high impact HIV-related
research. A major barrier has been insufficient human resources with requisite knowledge and skills to
support in the application, management and administration of funded research projects and this has
contributed significantly to the paucity of locally initiated high impact HIV research. Over the years, the UoN
has made efforts to enhance research administration and management leading to the establishment of the
Center for Research, Innovation and Grants Advancement (CERIGA). This Center is an outcome of
investments by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the International Extramural Associates
Development Award (IEARDA) and the Medical education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) is mandated to
support researchers at the University of Nairobi throughout the grant management cycle by identifying funding
opportunities, supporting researchers through the application process, management during implementation
and closeout in compliance with donor requirements. In partnership with the University of Washington (UW),
we propose to implement a project entitled “Strengthening Research Administration and Management
for Critical HIV Research in Kenya (STRAM-CHR)” aimed at enhancing local capacity for administrative
and financial management required for the research infrastructure support functions at the University of
Nairobi (UoN) and local partner institutions. Through this project, first, we aim to provide additional and
updated knowledge and skills to research administration personnel working at CERIGA, other funded projects
within the UoN, the UoN Finance Department and other institutions collaboratively implementing research
projects to build their capacity to support investigators and researchers who are conducting critical HIV
research. Secondly, we plan to develop key policies and guidelines for Research Administration and
Management at the UoN and develop new ones where they do not exist. Thirdly, we aim to review, update
and convert existing relevant training programs to e-format with specific focus on: Research administration
and management; Research integrity oversight; Ethical review of research; Information and communications
technology systems (ICT) for research and Monitoring and Evaluation. These courses will be accessed by
the larger team of research administrators within UoN and all its partners. By the end of the three years of
this project, we believe that the UoN will have increased capacity to support application and implementation
of donor funded projects and CERIGA will emerge as a Center of Excellence in Research Administration and
Management supporting several institutions in Kenya and beyond.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in sensing pathogens and tuning immune responses.
Functionally distinct subsets of DCs can stimulate different types of immune responses, but DCs
also display functional plasticity in response to microbial stimuli or signals from the tissue
microenvironment. However, it is now clear that DCs sense not just microbial stimuli, but also
various stress signals (e.g. amino acid starvation), through ancient stress sensing mechanisms,
leading to a metabolic reprogramming of their function. In particular our recent work has
revealed fundamental roles for two major amino acid sensors GCN2 and mTOR, in
programming DCs to modulate adaptive immunity and inflammation. We have shown that GCN2
plays a role in programming DCs to respond to viral vaccination, and in controlling intestinal
inflammation by promoting autophagy and suppressing inflammasome activation in gut APCs
and epithelial cells. Furthermore, our recent data demonstrates that GCN2 regulates allergic
inflammation in the lung. In addition to these effects of GCN2, we have recently shown that
mTOR regulates developmental fate of DCs and alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung, and
reprograms their metabolic state to modulate the outcome of allergic inflammation. In the
following aims, we will determine the mechanisms of this metabolic imprinting.
Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which mTOR controls the homeostasis and
function of lung DCs and AMs in the steady state and during allergic inflammation. Our
recent work demonstrates that in mice in which mTOR is genetically ablated in CD11c+ cells
(mTORAPC mice): (i) CD103+ DCs and AMs in the lung are greatly reduced in number, in the
steady state. (ii) Although the lung CD11c+CD11b+ DCs were numerically unaffected, they were
skewed in their transcriptional identity towards the macrophage/monocytic profile. (iii) Lung
allergic Th2 inflammation was skewed toward the Th17/neutrophilic phenotype. In the present
aim, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects, and investigate the potential
role of 4E-BP3 dependent translational control, lipid metabolism and epigenetic reprograming in
mediating the effects of mTOR signaling.
Aim 2: To determine the mechanisms by which GCN2 regulates Th2 responses and
allergic inflammation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that GCN2 knockout mice display
markedly reduced allergic inflammation in the lung. In this aim we will determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying this effect. The successful completion of these aims will yield rich
mechanistic insights about metabolic imprinting of DC fate and function."

Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of aging that features the death of retinal ganglion cell neurons
(RGCs) in the retina, often as a result of prolonged increases in intraocular pressure. This cell death leads to a
decrease in visual acuity and ultimately blindness. While glial and immune responses have been associated with
glaucoma, little understood about their potential causative role in loss of vision. Reactive astrocytes are
increasingly shown to appear well before traditional pathological readouts of a wide range of neurodegenerative
diseases, including glaucoma. One subset of reactive astrocytes reported by us and others as putatively
neurotoxic. These neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are present in regions of neurodegeneration in human
postmortem tissue from patients with multiple diseases of aging, as well as in the retina following acute injury to
RGC axons and in a chronic retinal degeneration in a bead occlusion model of glaucoma. Preventing formation
of neurotoxic reactive astrocytes prevents death of neurons, and spared neurons are electrophysiologically
functional and thus still have potential value for regeneration following injury and in disease.
We now report that these reactive astrocytes secrete a potent neurotoxic lipid, specifically long-chain free fatty
acids, that induce death of neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. Block of the enzyme involved in production of toxic
lipids, Elovl1, in astrocytes preserves neuron numbers. Together, these findings highlight a subset of reactive
astrocytes as drivers of RGC death in a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the eye. Here we will investigate
the role of reactive astrocyte-derived toxic lipids to determine the timing and mechanism of reactive astrocytes
in driving death of RGC somas in the retina, during acute and chronic injury to the eye. We will focus on three
broad research questions: is the PERK-ATF3 pathway required to drive neuron cell death by astrocyte
toxic lipids? Does blocking neurotoxic reactive astrocytes preserve neuronal function and visual acuity
in a mouse model of glaucoma? And what is the requirement for neuronal susceptibility prior to
astrocyte-induced cell death? We will determine maintenance of optic nerve axons using a mouse model
deficient for neurotoxic lipids released by reactive astrocytes in combination with investigating changes in visual
acuity in glaucomatous mice using both wildtype and toxic lipid-deficient mice to determine if targeting reactive
astrocytes can preserve vision. We will also investigate individual components of the PERK-ATF3 mediated
lipoapoptosis pathway – a putative mechanism by which reactive astrocyte secreted toxic lipids drive death of
neurons.
This proposal will investigate a novel approach to maintain vision during glaucoma. It will provide for the first
time a connection between astrocyte reactivity, RGC health, visual acuity, and thalamic synaptic connections."

 Asthma and chronic bronchitis are among the top causes of death and hospitalizations worldwide.
Chronic airway inflammation in asthma causes goblet cell metaplasia (GCM), mucus hypersecretion, and
airway plugging, resulting in respiratory failure and poor quality of life. The mechanism for acquisition and
persistence of chronic inflammation is not known. Current anti-inflammatory treatments for asthma can be
ineffective and are not curative; chronic GCM resumes upon treatment discontinuation. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of chronic inflammation and GCM in asthma. Host genetics
and the environment both contribute to asthma; the environment contributes to asthma by inducing immune
and airway epithelial epigenetic memory. Basal stem cells in the airway epithelium may acquire epigenetic
changes and act as a memory reservoir; as cellular turnover in the lungs occurs, basal cells replenish the
epithelium and may propagate inflammatory memory, causing GCM. The importance of airway epithelial
epigenetic memory in chronic lung inflammation is an emerging area of research. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that basal stem cells acquire IL-13-induced epigenetic changes and propagate inflammatory
memory as they mitotically replenish the epithelium causing GCM and abnormal epithelial function; we plan
to address the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Identify mechanisms of IL-13-induced memory in human
large and small airway epithelia basal cells using transcriptomic, epigenomic, and clonotype analysis; we
will determine the effect of IL-13-induced memory on GCM and function of airway epithelia. Specific Aim
2: Determine epigenetic inflammatory memory in asthmatic nasal airway basal cells obtained non-
invasively using nasal brushings and in vitro expansion; this will allow us to determine how memory
acquired by basal cells in asthma contribute to GCM, and whether inflammatory memory in asthma is IL-13-
driven. Specific Aim 3: Investigate whether epigenetic changes acquired by tracheobronchial airway
basal cells in vivo determine response to IL-13 in vitro leveraging a biobank of primary tracheobronchial
basal cells developed by the PI; we will determine the epigenetic, transcriptional and phenotypic memory of
epithelia highly susceptible to and epithelia resistant to IL-13-induced GCM. We will also determine whether
drugs targeting GCM revert epigenetic memory. With the completion of this proposal, we expect to have
identified A) novel mechanisms, B) treatment targets, and C) biomarkers and precision medicine strategies
in asthmatics and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases. This is a first step to enable curative asthma
treatments. We will further the NHLBI’s mission to “translate basic discoveries into clinical practice” and to
“enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.”"
10764283,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Salivation is a critical physiological activity that aids digestion, maintains oral health, and supports functions such
as speech, swallowing and taste sensation. Salivary gland dysfunction results from ageing, diseases such as
Sjögren syndrome and from radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Therapeutic irradiation causes permanent
damage to salivary glands, highlighting their poor regenerative ability. One potential obstacle to recovery of
salivation may be that damage, particularly during radiation therapy, is inflicted not only on saliva-generating
epithelial cells but also on supporting mesenchymal cells. Indeed, preservation or restoration of mesenchymal
cell function may constitute an ideal therapeutic target, as an optimized mesenchymal microenvironment may
augment the function and regenerative capacity of residual salivary gland epithelial cells and their progenitors.
A knowledge of how mesenchymal cells function during homeostasis and contribute to regeneration after injury
thus may provide a new approach to activate mechanisms that protect salivary glands and enhance their repair.
In many organs the mesenchymal expression of signals that provide regenerative feedback to the epithelium
during homeostasis and injury repair is induced by expression of a Hedgehog (Hh) protein signal from the
epithelium. Using mouse genetic models, cell lineage tracing, and single-cell transcriptomics, we have
discovered that Desert hedgehog (DHH), the least studied of the three mammalian Hh family members, drives
an epithelial-mesenchymal feedback (EMF) circuit in the major adult salivary glands, and that activity of this
circuit is crucial for salivary gland maintenance and for regeneration after radiation injury. Importantly, although
DHH expression in cells of the salivary gland epithelium is essential for regeneration, our findings also highlight
a vital role for mesenchymal response to this signal for execution of the regenerative program.
 Here we propose to elucidate the role of Hh signaling in salivary gland homeostasis and regeneration by
characterizing at a single cell level the transcriptomic and epigenetic consequences of EMF circuit activity, and
to assess the conservation of DHH-driven EMF circuitry in human salivary glands. With the goal of manipulating
Hh pathway activity for protection from or enhancement of tissue repair after radiation injury, we have developed
a conformation-specific nanobody against the Hh receptor Patched1 that activates Hh pathway response. This
nanobody can be targeted to specific cell and tissue types, thus mitigating potential adverse effects arising from
systemic Hh pathway activation. With this agent, we will test the possibility that precise, tissue-targeted activation
of the Hh pathway can effectively enhance endogenous reparative mechanisms for salivary gland protection
from and restoration after injury from irradiation like that administered in head and neck cancer therapy."

Drug abuse remains an urgent public health problem. One way to reduce the burden of the problem is to
identify risk factors for who will develop drug use problems. The fact that only a few of the many people who
experiment with drugs progress to develop problem use suggests that individuals differ in vulnerability. One
source of variability is initial response to a drug, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Individuals vary in
their initial responses to drugs in ways that predict risk, and these individual differences in drug responses
originate, in part, in individual responses in brain function. In this project, we will study individual differences in
responses the prototypic stimulant, methamphetamine, by examining both its behavioral rewarding effects and
its actions on the brain. Individuals differ in subjective responses to methamphetamine, and preliminary
evidence indicates that these differences are related to reactivity of the reward circuit to monetary reward. In
this project, we will use fMRI to examine the responses of the striatal-frontal reward circuit to
methamphetamine, and determine how individual differences in the neural effects predict behavioral indices of
drug liking and reward. First we will obtain indices of neural activity with fMRI after methamphetamine vs
placebo: regional activation elicited by a reward task, task-related functional connectivity, and resting state
functional connectivity. Then on separate sessions we will obtain indices of the behaviorally rewarding effects
of methamphetamine: drug liking, drug (and dose) choice and attentional bias to a drug-paired stimulus.
Understanding the relation between the neural response and behavioral response to the drug will extend our
understanding of why people differ in positive responses to a stimulant drug."
10777256,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The millions of brain MRIs acquired each year in clinical settings are a vastly underutilized scientific resource.
Meanwhile, brain MRIs collected in research studies often struggle to recruit cohorts fully representative of
populations of interest, particularly in the case of rare neurodevelopmental disorders. One clear opportunity for
discovery science are pediatric MRIs where gross pathology has been ruled out in children with headache,
concern for head trauma, or neurodevelopmental symptoms such as delayed milestones, autism, or psychosis.
One reason why brain morphology phenotypes derived from clinical brain MRIs have been underutilized is due
to the expected technical differences across sites and scanners, which pose methodological and statistical
challenges. However, our study team recently developed brain growth charts based on one of the largest
aggregated neuroimaging datasets to date, which provide an unprecedented model for brain MRI
developmental imaging phenotypes -- including quantitative measures of brain volumes of cortical and
subcortical brain regions – to be accurately benchmarked against population norms while controlling for
technical differences. In preliminary investigations, we have now further developed this approach to benchmark
individual patients' brain anatomy against hospital norms – so-called “clinical controls” – to provide high-quality
imaging metrics to combine with data on genetics, environmental exposures, and neuropsychiatric outcomes.
Using advanced, fully-reproducible image processing, deep learning, and statistical modelling, we will develop
a clinical radiomics reference that allows precise quantification of where an individual clinically-acquired brain
MRI lies in reference to expected developmental variation, using 20,000 clinical MRIs without gross pathology
obtained by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia care teams (Aim 1). By integrating records of clinical MRIs with
large-scale CHOP biobanks, we will identify developmental imaging phenotypes associated with high genetic
risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (Aim 2). By integrating secondary analysis of
clinically-acquired scans with prospective behavioral phenotyping and neuroimaging, we will identify
developmental imaging phenotypes associated with psychiatric vulnerability in individual patients (Aim 3).
Throughout, we will generate practically useful brain chart resources that will facilitate analysis of clinically-
acquired brain scans by other researchers (Aim 4). By leveraging clinically-acquired brain MRIs, this proposal
harnesses untapped neurogenomic information to investigate neurodevelopment trajectories in high-risk youth,
capitalizing on the PI and assembled team's expertise in psychiatric and developmental brain imaging,
imaging-genetics and neuroinformatics. The project will provide the necessary infrastructure to support future
HIPAA-compliant multi-site collaborative projects across health systems with expected sample sizes on the
order of millions of scans."

The discovery of brain cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV), broadly known as exosomes, has led
to studies examining their role as `liquid biopsies' for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). sEV
offer a unique, repeatable, and less invasive tool to discover molecular changes in multiple cell types of the brain
during Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we propose to test the usefulness of brain cells-derived
sEV to discover the molecular pathways targeted by a dietary intervention against AD and to identify individuals
responsive to such intervention. Earlier studies have shown the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet (KD) against
ADRD, and we have developed a KD version known as a `Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet (MMKD)' with
improved nutrition and compliance, and recently in a pilot study published its promising beneficial effects in
individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Based upon these exciting results, a phase II study
(BEAT-AD: Brain Energy for Amyloid Transformation in AD, R01AG055122, PI: Craft) was initiated to test MMKD
efficacy in adults with aMCI in comparison to a low-fat American Heart Association Diet (AHAD). In BEAT-AD,
all participants (100 adults with aMCI) undergo comprehensive cognitive testing, brain MRIs, apoE genotyping,
and metabolic profiling. Additional assessments include CSF analysis of AD biomarkers and PET imaging of the
brain for amyloid and tau deposition, ketone uptake, and glucose metabolism. Together, these `gold-standard'
measures will assess the efficacy of MMKD against AD but are unlikely to establish the effect of MMKD on key
molecular determinants of aMCI brain. Additionally, there is no known blood-based biomarker to identify those
individuals who would be most responsive to MMKD. To demonstrate the usefulness of sEV in understanding
the molecular action of MMKD at the neuronal level, we obtained plasma samples from the completed pilot study
and generated solid feasibility data, published recently in the journal Brain Communications. Based upon these
exciting findings, we propose to further establish the effect of MMKD on glutamate-glutamate receptor-Aβ
signaling, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the BEAT-AD study. In this ancillary study, we will isolate
various brain cells-derived sEV from the plasma of all 100 participants (both pre- and post-MMKD and –AHAD)
and characterize in the following aims: Aim I: sEV characterization to assess the effect of MMKD intervention
on glutamate signaling and synaptic plasticity-related biomarkers in individuals with aMCI; Aim II: sEV
characterization to determine the effect of MMKD intervention on oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in
individuals with aMCI; and Aim III: To characterize brain cells-derived sEV to predict response to MMKD
intervention in individuals with aMCI. Outcomes will establish brain cells-derived sEV as liquid biopsies to non-
invasively assess the effect of MMKD on molecular circuitries in the aMCI brain and their clinical application in
screening individuals responsive to MMKD, leading to an evidence-based `personalized approach' to AD."

Alcohol use and abuse affect millions of people, exacting immense tolls on personal and public health and the
economy. One of the most reported consequences of active alcohol use and recovery from alcohol use disorder
is insomnia, which includes difficulties falling asleep (increased sleep latency), staying asleep, or achieving high-
quality sleep. Alcohol-induced insomnia is highly predictive of relapse, making it an important driver of persistent
alcohol abuse. For improved treatment of alcohol use disorder and prevention of relapse, we need to understand
the mechanisms of alcohol-associated sleep problems, which are currently unknown. Drosophila offer a valuable
approach to unraveling these mechanisms thanks to their translational relevance for sleep and alcohol responses
and their high economy of scale. My preliminary data show that a single, high-dose alcohol exposure robustly
increases sleep latency, the time it takes to fall asleep, for at least six nights. Based on these findings, in Aim 1,
I propose determining the genetic contributions to alcohol-induced sleep delays. I will do so by examining human
genes, identified with Genome-Wide Association Studies, that are linked to alcohol and sleep phenotypes. I will
test these candidate genes in the Drosophila nervous system, examining their necessity for alcohol-induced
sleep effects. In Aim 2, I will determine the roles of neurons and conserved neurotransmitter systems in alcohol-
induced sleep disruptions. I will utilize a subset of a few hundred uncharacterized neurons that our lab has found
to affect both sleep latency and alcohol responses. I will examine the role of these in alcohol-induced sleep
delays and determine the neurotransmitters required for regulating sleep, alcohol responses, and their interaction
in these neurons. Together, these experiments will identify potential genetic and molecular targets for treating
alcohol use disorders and their associated sleep disturbances. While I have a strong academic background and
laboratory experience focused on rodent addiction, I require additional training to develop as an independent
researcher. My goals as a graduate student are to build strength in neurogenetics, Drosophila model systems,
the neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol abuse, behavioral analysis, and tools for studying these topics. This
foundation will prepare me to pursue my long-term career goal of obtaining a tenured faculty position. I anticipate
that my preliminary data plus the aims described here will produce at least one scientific manuscript each while
also supplying preliminary data for future grant applications. Under the training provided by this fellowship, I will
refine technical skills, deepen my expertise in alcohol research, and become independent in experimental choice,
design, analysis, and communication. These skills will propel me on my trajectory towards a career as an
independent researcher and educator. While facilitating these goals, the proposed project will also shed
necessary first mechanistic light on the phenomenon of alcohol-induced sleep loss, which is a critical contributor
to persistent human alcohol use."
10782518,"Cholangiopathies, including primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are cholestatic liver diseases that target
cholangiocytes. No definitive treatments for PSC exist and curative measures are elusive, thus translational
studies are critically needed. PSC is characterized by ductular reaction (DR) encompassing enhanced bile duct
mass, biliary senescence, inflammation, peribiliary fibrosis and increased portal mast cell (MC)
presence/activation. During liver damage, MCs migrate to the liver and reside near damaged/senescent bile
ducts and inhibition of biliary-derived senescent associated secretory phenotypes (SASP) reduces PSC
phenotypes in mice. The exact source of MC infiltration/activation or stabilization remains unclear. Melatonin
exerts its effects via specific receptors, MT1 and MT2, which are expressed by cholangiocytes and upregulated
in cholestasis but have differential effects on liver damage. Knockdown of MT1 decreases cholestatic liver injury,
whereas knockdown of MT2 increases cholestatic liver injury. Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of
melatonin are well-known; however, melatonin can also inhibit HA signaling, suggesting a link between these
two molecules that, to date, has remained elusive. One key element between melatonin signaling and MC-
histamine (HA) is the alarmin and SASP, IL-33, which is the ligand of the ST2 receptor (expressed on MCs) and
IL-33/ST2 are upregulated in cholestasis. Since melatonin modulates IL-33/ST2 signaling which regulates MC
activation/stabilization, there is a natural link between these two. Preliminary data demonstrates that (i) IL-33/ST2
signaling increases in human PSC and Mdr2-/- mice that correlates with increased HA content; (ii) Mdr2-/- mice
treated with an ST2 inhibitor have reduced DR, inflammation and IL-33 content; and (ii) melatonin therapy
decreases MC activation and biliary IL-33 content. These data support our overall hypothesis that, during liver
damage, increased systemic and hepatic IL-33 levels induce MC infiltration/activation driving PSC phenotypes,
which can be ameliorated via modulation of melatonin/MT-1 signaling. SA1 Hypothesis: Hepatic IL-33/ST2
signaling drives MC infiltration/activation and PSC phenotypes. We will evaluate (i) the cellular source(s) of IL-
33 using in vivo models and in vitro systems; and (ii) effects of IL-33/ST2 modulation on MC migration/activation
and PSC phenotypes. SA2 Hypothesis: MCs infiltration increases IL-33 during liver damage and manipulation
of MC mediators decreases IL-33/ST2 signaling. We will determine if (i) manipulation of MC-HA signaling directly
alters IL-33/ST2 signaling, using cultured systems and 3D human organoids; (ii) changes in MC-HA/HR signaling
in vivo mediates IL-33/ST2 outcomes and (iii) if manipulation of MCs in vitro affects PSC phenotypes. SA3
Hypothesis: Exogenous melatonin or manipulation of melatonin signaling decreases liver damage by stabilization
of MCs and downregulation of IL-33/ST2 and there is an autocrine regulation of biliary melatonin that may reduce
MC activation and IL-33/ST2. We will measure (i) effects of melatonin therapy on PSC outcomes; (ii) autocrine
effects of biliary melatonin on IL-33/ST2 and disease phenotypes."
10788332,"The molecular mechanism that defines whether inflammasome activation leads to cell death or survival 
and activation of immune cells, is unknown. Inflammasomes are protein complexes that function as 
cellular pathogen sensors. Upon sensing a pathogen, a member of the caspase cysteine protease family, 
caspase-1 is activated in inflammasomes. Active caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin-D (GSDMD), that 
subsequently forms pores throughout the plasma membrane leading to a form of cell death named 
pyroptosis. Paradoxically, the formation of GSDMD pores on the plasma membrane does not always lead 
to pyroptosis. It has been described that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) 
results in membrane repair. It is not known what are the upstream signals which determine whether 
damaged membranes are repaired or not. It is an important problem, because without understanding this, 
the beneficial part of inflammasome activation (cytokine maturation) cannot be uncoupled from the 
detrimental and highly inflammatory pyroptosis. Based on our preliminary data, our hypothesis is that the 
ESCRT complex is inactivated via protease cleavage by caspase-2, which promotes pyroptosis. This 
hypothesis is supported by our preliminary work in which bacterial pore forming toxins trigger the 
pathogen detection response and stimulate inflammasomes. In this system, caspase-2 interacts with and 
cleaves the ESCRT associated protein ALIX. The rationale for the research is that, understanding this 
novel regulation of inflammasome driven pyroptosis could lead to new and innovative approaches to the 
prevention and treatment of a variety of infectious diseases. To test our central hypothesis and 
accomplish our overall objective, we formulated two specific aims: 1.) Elucidate the mechanism underlying 
the inflammasome dependent pyroptosis activation via membrane repair inhibition. Based on the 
preliminary data herein, our working hypothesis is that one or more regulatory components of ESCRT 
complex are inactivated by caspase-2 cleavage. 2.) Identify the upstream mechanisms that unleash 
caspase-2 dependent inactivation of membrane repair mechanisms in pyroptosis."

Testing the Efficacy of an eHealth Decision Support Tool to Help Latinx Cancer Patients Make Informed
 Decisions About Tumor Genomic Testing

The use of tumor genomic profiling (TGP) to identify potential cancer treatments can also identify secondary
hereditary risks the patient was unaware of. ASCO policy mandates communication of TGP risks and elicit patient
preferences for managing these types of results. Latinx patients have increased cancer risk and mortality but are
especially vulnerable to barriers that would impede optimal decision making about secondary genetic risks,
including language and acculturation barriers, access and affordability, deportation risks, medical mistrust and low
genetic knowledge. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an electronic health (eHealth)
decision support tool (DST) to increase informed decision making among Latinx patients. This proposal builds on
current RCT results of testing an eHealth DST called Gene Pilot with Black cancer patients and formative work
with Latinx patients funded by the pilot mechanism of the current U54 Partnership. These studies use innovative
commercial marketing methods to address TGP concerns, promote informed decision making, and increase
communication with providers about preferences for secondary genetic information. Grounded in the Ottawa
Framework, the study will determine the efficacy of a revised DST, Gene PilotLX, compared to traditional decision
support. Specific aims are: 1. Revise the Gene Pilot DST to reflect formative work with Latinx cancer patients to
incorporate specific cultural values and language needs. We will use formative results and establish Community
and Scientific Advisory Boards to revise content to make it culturally-anchored. We will then conduct user testing
with 25 Latinx cancer patients; 2. Test the impact of Gene PilotLX in a randomized trial. We will conduct a fully
powered RCT with 232 Latinx cancer patients at four oncology sites. Intervention participants will have access to
Gene PilotLX via a tablet or personal device; the comparison arm will receive non-targeted education materials
about TGP. Primary outcomes include decision preparedness, decisional conflict, and communication of
preferences with a doctor. Secondary outcomes include communication of preferences with family and changes in
perceptions of TGP. H1: Those in the Gene PilotLX arm will have greater reduced decisional conflict and higher
decision preparedness compared to the non-targeted decision aid. H2: Those in the Gene PilotLX arm will report
communicating TGP preferences with their oncologist more when compared to the non-targeted information arm;
and 3. Determine whether the effects of Gene PilotLX on primary and secondary outcomes are moderated by
Latinx cultural values and acculturation. H3: Gene PilotLX will have a larger effect on primary outcomes for those
holding stronger values of familismo and those who are more acculturated than those with lower values. The
reverse will occur with the Latinx value of fatalismo. Break Systemic Barriers to Inclusion: In line with the U54’s
Inclusive Excellence vision, this study addresses systemic barriers by focusing on Latinx-specific challenges to
engaging and communicating about TGP, thereby reducing potential cancer health disparities by improving
informed decision making in an under-studied population at high risk of cancer."

Changes in DNA methylation phenotype in CRC associated with racial disparities

 HC: Frida E. Kleiman, PhD (Co-Leader)
Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher in African Americans (AA)
compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). Current non-invasive screening tools, such as fecal occult blood tests
(FOBT) or fecal DNA markers, detect cancer after it occurs. More effective tools for prevention and treatment of
higher risk individuals, such as colonoscopy or endoscopy, are invasive, less popular and subjective, and current
uptake of these screening tools is lower among AA compared to CA. Therefore, identification of early and
objective biomarkers that distinguish normal colon mucosa of individuals at high risk for CRC from individuals at
low risk might decrease racial disparities in CRC. In our previous U54 Pilot project (Cycle 1), we have identified
a subgroup of patients having highly disrupted epigenomes displaying abnormal DNA methylation patterns in
their normal mucosa, identified as “Outlier Methylation Phenotype” (OMP). We have been able to significantly
associate this phenotype with CRC patients over healthy controls. Furthermore, AA CRC patients appear more
than twice as likely as CA patients to have OMP. In the current cycle, we propose to determine the prevalence
of OMPs in a larger group of patients in Specific Aim 1A, both AA (150 CRC and 200 controls) and CA (150 CRC
and 200 Controls). In Specific Aim 1B, we will elucidate biological mechanisms for the contribution of OMP to
CRC tumorigenesis using patient derived organoids (PDO). In Specific Aim 2, we will also determine whether
OMP - affected genes in AA patients are enriched in Black/Ancestry-informative genetic variants. In Specific Aim
3, we will determine whether environmental factors and social determinants influence the frequency of OMP in
AA groups. Break Systemic Barriers to Inclusion: Our Hunter College/Temple/Fox Chase interdisciplinary
team of bench scientists, clinicians and community outreach scientists is in a unique position to reduce systemic
barriers that lead to underrepresentation of the AA population in epigenetic research studies. This project
addresses data gaps by including AAs in the epigenetic studies and by developing quantitative and less invasive
screening tests that will potentially enable AAs to increase the uptake of CRC screening, and reduce colon
cancer disparities."

this project is to determine if PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapeutics can be expanded,
beyond the mutant BRCA1 cohorts, to Black/AA cohorts with mtp53/MDM2/MDMX/PARP
biomarkers. We will educate the Black/AA community about breast cancer biomarkers and will
empower them to ask biomarker-based questions during diagnosis and treatment. The aims are
the following. 1) To compare the expression of MDM2, MDMX, mtp53 and PARP in breast cancer
(BC) tumors from AA and EA patients. We will construct (BC) tissue microarrays (TMAs) from
retrospectively collected tumors from 125 AA and 125 EA patients. TMAs will be stained for
MDM2, MDMX, p53 and PARP. 2) We will test the driver roles of the MDM2/MDMX-mtp53-PARP

TUFCCC: Dr. Carolyn Fang (Co-Leader)
 HC: Dr. Olorunseun Ogunwobi
The Research Education Core (REC) builds upon our successful 5-year U54 Partnership and rigorous
multidisciplinary training environment at Temple University-Fox Chase Cancer Center (TUFCCC) and Hunter
College (HC). The overarching goal of the REC is to promote inclusive excellence in the training and
professional and scientific development of Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs) and students through intensive
mentored experiences in cancer health disparities research. The REC leverages exceptional institutional
strengths in training and research education across TUFCCC and HC, the outstanding core facilities of an NCI-
designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, our combined interdisciplinary research infrastructure in population,
clinical, translational and basic sciences, and a diverse student population across both institutions. In addition to
research training, the Research Education Core will nurture and mentor students throughout their studies, infuse
21st century skills of collaboration and communication, and develop professional career opportunities. The
overarching goal of the Research Education Core is to support educational activities that complement and
enhance the training of a diverse workforce to meet the nation’s cancer research needs. To achieve this goal,
the Research Education Core will address the following specific aims: Aim 1. Provide mentorship and research
support for 8 diverse ESIs to enhance career development and facilitate their transition to independent
investigators in cancer disparities research. The two-year fellowship will culminate with an application for external
funding to support the trainee’s transition into an independent investigator. Aim 2. Implement an enhanced 10-
week Summer Cancer Research Institute (SCRI) for 15 undergraduate and graduate students in biomedical or
population cancer research per year (75 students over 5 years). Our successful SCRI program, which offers
unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in biomedical, clinical, or population-
based cancer research, will be expanded from 10 to 15 trainees per year (a 50% increase). Aim 3. Facilitate
academic-community research opportunities to support the conduct of culturally appropriate cancer research in
partnership with underserved minority communities and populations. In collaboration with the COC and key
community partners, the REC will establish a semester-long rotation for ESIs and other trainees to foster greater
skills in conducting community-engaged research to address health disparities. These novel training
opportunities offered through collaborative academic-community partnerships will provide innovative hands-on
fieldwork experiences for trainees. In sum, the Research Education Core will promote inclusive excellence in
building a diverse workforce by breaking systemic barriers (including structural inequities and limited access to
mentored training), building a sense of community, and offering a sustainable pathway for impacting change and
advancing the careers of ESIs and other trainees working in cancer health disparities."

Early detection for cancer screening has long been established as an effective tool to reducing the cancer
burden; however, utilization of these services by underserved racial and ethnic minorities (UREM) continues to
be disproportionate. For example, breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remains low
among African American (AA), Asian Pacific American (APA), and Hispanic American (HA) populations. These
pre-existing disparities were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing culturally tailored
evidence-based cancer screening interventions to foster BC and CRC screening re-engagement through
community engagement and capacity building in underserved AA, APA, and HA communities is crucial. In
addition, up to 10% of all cancers may be caused by inherited genetic profiles. In recent days, genetic/genomic
testing for cancer risk assessment and treatment has been widely utilized clinically for cancer early detection,
diagnosis and treatment. However, the testing rates remain low in racial/ethnical minority populations as they
often face challenges and systemic barriers of social determinants of health, such as language barriers, low
health literacy, poor awareness and knowledge about genetic/genomic testing, and medical mistrust.
Overcoming these barriers to raise awareness and to increase testing is vital. Thus, building on the success of
our current funding cycle (2018-2023) in collaboration with TUFCCC/HC Partnership investigators and
community partners in the PA-NJ-New York City (PNN) region, the COC aims to use community-engaged
approach to addressing systemic barriers and promoting inclusion in accessing evidence-based
interventions on cancer screenings and genetic testing among underserved and understudied AA, APA and HA
populations. Specifically, the overall goals of the proposed COC are to: (1) engage the community in cancer
outreach and sustain cancer screening programs within the communities we serve, (2) support U54
investigators/ESIs/Trainees on community-based cancer research through building and maintaining sustainable
CBPR infrastructure; and (3) facilitate and enhance bi-directional communication between TUFCCC/HC
investigators and community."
10755780,"Allorecognition is the ability to discriminate self from non-self or kin from non-kin. It is observed in various
processes in every life kingdom, including immunity, development, sexual reproduction, and sociality.
Cooperation is another ubiquitous property that involves interactions between individuals, ranging from
interactions between single cells to interactions between groups of multicellular organisms. The evolution of
cooperation is a challenging riddle and one of its most perplexing aspects is altruism – the act of benefiting
another individual at an expense to the actor. Altruism is essential for cooperation but its evolutionary
advantages cannot be understood without considering allorecognition. The greenbeard hypothesis bridges the
concepts of allorecognition and altruism. Dawkins’ book ‘The Selfish Gene’ popularized Hamilton’s concept of
a genetic locus that exhibits three key properties – displaying a discernable signal, recognizing that signal in
others, and acting altruistically toward other individuals that display the signal. This idea was first considered
as a hypothetical situation that was unlikely in nature, but studies over the past three decades have
documented it in various organisms, including pathogenic bacteria, social insects, and even humans.
Nevertheless, most of these studies did not fully account for the third criterion, namely a direct relationship
between the greenbeard pathway and altruism. The allorecognition system of Dictyostelium discoideum relies
on two polymorphic compatible membrane proteins, TgrB1 and TgrC1. It has been described as a greenbeard
system in which TgrC1 confers the ability to signal kinship and TgrB1 confers the ability to recognize the
signal, but the altruistic act of stalk formation has not been directly attributed to these proteins. We hypothesize
that the tgrB1-tgrC1 pathway is a greenbeard system that confers the three elements of signaling, recognition,
and altruism, and that mutations in the pathway genes confer falsebeard cheating behaviors. We have recently
discovered that mutational activation of TgrB1 confers altruism in that cells that express the mutant protein
enhance the sporulation efficiency of their wild-type counterpart at an expense to themselves. We also
discovered that mutating downstream elements of the pathway confers falsebeard behaviors – inactivation of
the rapgapB or rasD genes and activation of rapA cause cheating among cells that display matching TgrB1
and TgrC1 signals. These mutations are directly related to the tgrB1-tgrC1 system because knocking out
rapgapB suppresses the developmental defects conferred by inactivation of the tgrB1-tgrC1 system, and rasD
and rapA are tightly related to rapgapB signaling. These pioneering findings directly link allorecognition and
altruism in one greenbeard pathway. We will study how activating mutations in tgrB1 confer altruistic behavior,
and how mutations that modify rapgapB, rapA, and rasD cause falsebeard cheating. Using genetic, cellular,
and transcriptome analysis approaches, we will rigorously test the greenbeard hypothesis and reveal the
molecular and cellular details of the respective social behaviors."
10755810,"Project Summary
Selective autophagy pathways use cargo receptors to degrade organelles, organelle subdomains, and
misfolded proteins that fail to be degraded by the proteosome. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) autophagy (also
called ER-phagy) is a selective autophagy pathway that acts in ER quality control. ER-phagy cargo receptors
connect an ER domain to the autophagosome biogenesis machinery via their ability to bind Atg8 family
members (LC3 or GABARAP in mammals). The studies in this proposal are aimed at addressing two important
unanswered questions in the field. First, we will ask how the conserved yeast ER-phagy cargo receptor, Atg40,
fragments domains of the ER that it targets for degradation. Second, we will ask how Atg40 loads ER domains
into autophagosomes, sealed double-membrane structures that are delivered to vacuoles (yeast) or lysosomes
(mammals) for degradation.
 We have found that a non-canonical form of the yeast COPII coat subcomplex, Sec23-Lst1, works with
Atg40 to package ER domains into autophagosomes during ER-phagy. The COPII coat is a multi-subunit coat
complex that is known for its role in sorting ER proteins into transport carriers that traffic on the secretory
pathway. We identified a novel role for Sec23-Lst1 in ER-phagy that is independent of its role in secretion.
While the reticulon homology domain of Atg40 has been implicated in ER fission, it is unclear if Atg40 requires
Sec23-Lst1 to fragment ER domains. An in vitro approach is needed to unambiguously answer this question.
We have found that a variation of the COPII coat in vitro vesicle budding assay can be used to assess the
requirements for Atg40-mediated ER fission. The COPII coat is formed by the sequential interactions of the
Sar1 GTPase and cytoplasmic coat subcomplexes. We will use this in vitro assay to address if Atg40, Sec23-
Lst1 and Atg8 are all needed for fission. Additionally, we will determine if purified Sar1, and other purified
cytoplasmic COPII subcomplexes are also required. A long-term goal of these studies is to develop a similar in
vitro ER fragmentation assay with mammalian COPII coat subcomplexes.
 To address how Atg40 sequesters membrane domains into autophagosomes, we will take advantage
of an unusual phenotype we observed in lipid droplet (LD) deficient cells. Lipid droplets are ER-derived
organelles that contain a neutral lipid core, triacylglycerides (TAG) and sterol esters (SE), surrounded by a
phospholipid monolayer. When yeast cells are devoid of LD, resident ER membrane proteins fail to be
delivered to the vacuole via ER-phagy. This defect appears to be due to the inability of the cargo receptor,
Atg40, to sequester ER domains into autophagosomes. We will perform biochemical, genetic and localization
studies to ask how LD are needed to couple Atg40 to its cargo. A long-term goal of these studies will be to
address the role of LD in mammalian ER-phagy. These studies will be relevant to variety of metabolic
disorders in humans, including diabetes and obesity."
10756990,"Investigation of Partial Electrical Nerve Block for Autonomic Regulation
 More than 600,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year. Sudden cardiac death
often occurs as a result of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or
heart failure (HF). Autonomic dysregulation following cardiac pathology is essential to the development of HF
and VT. Existing interventions are lacking in response time, reversibility, and adaptability over time. Thus, a
major unmet need is to impact/regulate sympathetic neural control of cardiac function using a targeted, rapid,
reversible, and gradable modality that is safe for autonomic nerves and, ultimately, can be deployed chronically.
Over the last decade, advances in the field of electrical nerve block, has shown promise to be this desired
therapeutic modality. Peripheral electrical nerve block has a rapid onset, is reversible and gradable. Previously
nerve block has been used to completely block a nerve. This is the first study to explore the value of partially
blocking a nerve. Partial electrical nerve block can mitigate autonomic reflexes without extinguishing them.
However, the stability and controllability of the block at any desired level are currently unknown. Understanding
the characteristics of partial block would result in far reaching contributions to the control of autonomic systems.
The feasibility of closed loop control of cardiac function is highly dependent on the availability of real time
feedback of autonomic parameters. Existing monitoring techniques are lacking in both responsiveness and
sensitivity. To provide a real-time control source, direct recording of autonomic nerve function will be performed
using real-time measurements of cardiac interstitial and vascular catecholamines. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that the autonomic system can be down regulated and the sympathetic drive to the heart maintained
at a clinically relevant lower set point using DC block. The ability to maintain the autonomic system at varying
specified set points based on changing cardiac function and indices of cardiac stress (e.g VT burden, heart rate)
would allow for highly patient specific disease interventions. Specifically, for this proposal, the goal is to regulate
functional sympathetic control of the heart and maintain a given set point for 30 minutes. Aim 1: Identify and
characterize the parameters of partial nerve block needed to maintain nerve block at a given set point using an
acute rodent model on the vagus (autonomic) nerve. Aim 2: Identify nerve block targets in the cardiac
sympathetic pathway and characterize the effect of partial block on evoked sympathetic reflex responses, in
particular the effect on block efficacy and recovery. Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of partial block on regional cardiac
norepinephrine using release fast scanning cyclic voltammetry in coordination with high density assessments of
regional cardiac electrical function. Aim 4: Using the neurotransmitter biosensor, develop a control paradigm to
determine both when to initiate block as well as determining the block level."
10756993,"Deregulation of genome interactions through mutations at regulatory elements or mutation of responsible
cellular nuclear enzymes result in multiple disorders. Although the significance of proper genomic-genomic
interactions has been seen from disease phenotypes, the underlying molecular mechanisms of genomic looping
regulation and the direct outcome of transcription are still not well connected. This partly stems from the highly
complex nature of cellular promoter regulation, since it is controlled by multiple transcriptional factors and enhancer
elements with significant noise within cell populations.
 Transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics studies with recombinant Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) episomes identified that the host cellular ChAHP (CHD4, ADNP, HP1) protein complex forms a
stable protein complex with KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and plays essential roles in maintaining
the inducibility of latent viral chromatin. The ChAHP complex is known to restrict cellular enhancer accessibility and
regulates cell lineage, although how the protein complex regulates enhancer-promoter interaction remains unknown.
Here, we hypothesize that the KSHV latency-lytic switch is a product of enhancer-promoter interactions regulated by
the LANA-ChAHP complex. In this application, we will study how the KSHV episome is maintained as an inducible
episome and if we can target the protein complex for therapeutic intervention. The molecular action of the
LANA/ChAHP protein complex will be studied from three different perspectives; (i) biochemical, (ii) genetic, and (iii)
protein complex structure. By taking advantage of defined enhancer-promoter pairs and convenient inducible mini
viral chromatin, we will study enhancer-promoter regulations by dissecting ChAHP protein complex function. The
proposed studies should not only benefit the understanding of the KSHV latency-lytic switch, but also provide insight
into cellular inducible enhancer regulatory mechanisms."
10757001,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Actin assembly underlies and drives many biological phenomena. Barbed ends
of actin filaments, the major sites of polymerization, are controlled by the heterodimeric
actin capping protein (CP). CP is regulated by the direct binding of CPI-motif proteins
and the protein V-1. These two classes of regulators, CPI-motif proteins and V-1, bind
to opposite sides of CP, and they induce conformational changes in CP that
allosterically antagonize the binding of the other class. We are studying the molecular
biophysical mechanism of these allosteric regulators. We are also studying the
physiological function of CP and its regulators, using biochemical reconstitution with
purified components, along with molecular genetic perturbations of living cells.
 Our biochemical studies will test a novel hypothesis for how CP regulators
function in cells. Cells contain stoichiometric amounts of V-1 in micromolar
concentrations, sufficient to inhibit nearly all of the cellular CP. V-1 is highly diffusible,
and V-1 sterically blocks the ability of CP to cap actin filaments. CPI-motif proteins are
targeted to membranes, and their CPI motifs allosterically induce the dissociation of V-
1, thus activating CP locally at the membrane.
 We are testing this hypothesis by determining the molecular biophysical
mechanism of the allostery, and by testing the functions of the CPI-motif proteins with
respect to cell motility and migration. We have discovered key differences in the
biochemical activities of different families of CPI-motif proteins, and we are now using
that information to investigate the allosteric mechanism, by combining single-molecule
FRET measurements with molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we are using
purified proteins and lipids in a biochemical reconstitution system that induces actin
assembly at a surface, thereby mimicking actin polymerization at cellular membranes.
We are also using our discoveries about biochemical activities of CPI motifs to test
cellular functions of CPI-motif proteins, using chimeras constructed from different CPI-
motif proteins with molecular genetic perturbations and real-time movies of the motility
phenomena of living cells. Our cell motility assays employ a system of endothelial cell
monolayers with transmigrating immune and cancer cells, mimicking the physiological
process of transendothelial migration."

Beta-2 glycoprotein-I (b2GPI) is a 50-kDa glycoprotein that circulates in the blood at a concentration of 0.2
mg/ml. It was originally discovered in 1961 but received little attention until 1990 when it was identified as the
dominant antigen of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the autoimmune disorder known as
Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). Patients affected by APS develop blood clots in veins and arteries as well
as pregnancy complications. Occlusions of the vascular system may lead to life-threatening complications such
as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and stroke. Despite the established correlation between the
presence of anti-b2GPI antibodies and thrombosis, APS remains incredibly challenging to diagnose and
treat for physicians. There are two main issues. First, anti-b2GPI antibodies are very heterogeneous, and not
all of them are pathogenic. Hence, laboratory tests are difficult to develop, standardize and interpret. This affects
our ability to identify, with confidence, patients at higher risk for thrombosis who require prompt pharmacological
intervention. Second, treatment options are limited to the prophylactic administration of long-term anticoagulants,
anti-platelets, and low molecular weight heparin, that block the downstream effect of aPL, i.e., activation of the
clotting cascade. This mechanism of action, however, is non-optimal for treating APS patients and, in addition to
negatively affecting patients’ lifestyle and exposing them to the risk of fatal bleeding, among other things, these
drugs also fail to prevent thrombotic recurrences in ~30% of the APS patient population, especially in those
individuals with arterial thrombosis. To address these unmet clinical needs, physician and basic scientists have
joined forces over the past twenty years and launched several key initiatives with the goal of standardizing the
diagnosis of APS patients and determining the optimal management of aPL-positive patients. Thus,
understanding the role of b2GPI in APS became a top priority in the field. Thanks to these collective efforts,
much has been learned about the subclasses of aPL causing thrombosis and the signaling pathways triggered
by anti-β2GPI antibodies. Less clear, however, remain the structural properties of β2GPI, the mechanisms
controlling antigen-antibody recognition and the circumstances under which β2GPI becomes immunogenic. To
bridge this gap in our fundamental knowledge, this research project seeks to elucidate the structural
architecture β2GPI under conditions relevant to physiology, define the structural determinants for the
interaction of β2GPI with aPL and physiological ligands, and develop an improved diagnostic test for the
detection of pathogenic anti-b2GPI antibodies in patients’ plasma. Information gathered through these
studies will contribute to establishing the missing link between structure, function, and immunogenicity of β2GPI
in APS, and will open new avenues for APS-specific diagnostics and therapeutics."

10762663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Food allergy is associated with a hypersensitive type 2 immune response that develops following sensitization
to food proteins. Allergic sensitization elicits the development of adaptive immune memory, characterized by
antigen specific B-cells that produce antibodies of the IgE and IgG1 isotypes. IgE antibodies bind to tissue-
resident mast cells, and these IgE-mast cell units enable a rapid and exuberant responses to low quantities of
food antigen. Pre-clinical and clinical studies underscore the importance of IgE antibodies in the
gastrointestinal manifestation of food allergy, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; however, how
this hypersensitive state is established and what mast-cells induce to initiate these symptoms are poorly
understood. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that close symbiotic interactions between mast cells
and epithelial cells enable intraepithelial mast cell expansion within the allergic intestines, and that mast cells in
turn alter both the transcriptional state and differentiation of intestinal epithelium to mediate their effects on
food allergy symptoms. Preliminary data in in vivo food allergy models demonstrates marked intraepithelial
mast cell expansion in food allergic mice, with the greatest frequencies found in the proximal small intestine in
the crypt/transit amplifying zone. We further identified a leukotriene transcriptional signature in the intestines of
food allergic mice, which was largely confined to the intraepithelial layer and was dependent on IgE and FceR1
expressing cells. Consistently, pharmacological and genetic disruption of cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis was
found to dramatically blunt intestinal symptoms of food allergen ingestion, with separate cysteinyl leukotriene
receptors mediating the acute behavioral (CysLTR2) and physiological effects (CysLTR1) to allergen. We
hypothesized that mast-cell epithelial cross talk through cysteinyl leukotrienes may contribute to symptoms
such as allergen induced malaise. In support of this, we find mast cells induce transcription of the stress-
related TGFb cytokine, GDF15, from colonic crypt epithelial cells via a CysLTR1 dependent mechanism, and
that GDF15 blockade ameliorates late phase avoidance behavior to allergen. This proposal aims to build upon
these findings through the following aims: Aim 1 will examine IgE-dependent transcriptional and cell
composition changes in the intestinal epithelium and will identify candidate epithelium-derived mast cell growth
factors in vitro and in vivo, Aim 2 will clarify the role of cysteinyl leukotrienes and their receptors in food allergy
pathogenesis using pharmacological inhibitors, genetic knockouts, and CysLTR1-3 floxed mice, and Aim 3 will
examine the transcriptional state of GDF15+ epithelial cells induced by food allergy and will investigate the
behavioral and immunological effect of GDF15 and GFRAL deficiency using newly generated KO mice on the
BALB/cJ background. Together, these studies will enhance our understanding of how the hypersensitive state
of the intestine is establish in food allergy, and the role of mast-cell interactions with epithelial and neuronal
cells in driving symptoms of allergen ingestion."
10763002,"Project Summary
The long-term objective of this project is to identify new, more effective, and less toxic therapeutic approaches
for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and poor-prognosis breast cancer subtype. Our
team recently led the clinical development of the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for metastatic TNBC
(mTNBC), Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG, aka Trodelvy), achieving dramatically improved objective response
rates (ORRs), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), and resulting in accelerated FDA
approval in 2020. SG comprises the topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor SN-38 (the active metabolite of
irinotecan) coupled to a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting Trop-2, a tumor antigen expressed in >90%
of mTNBC. While it represents a paradigm-changing therapy, only approximately 30% of mTNBC patients
experience a therapeutic response to SG, highlighting the need to identify combination therapies with SG that
will uniquely complement and enhance its efficacy. Our preliminary data lead to the hypothesis that PARP
inhibition (PARPi) is synergistic with SG in mTNBC. Accordingly, we are carrying out a funded investigator-
initiated phase 1b/2 clinical trial (NCT04039230) of SG and PARPi (talazoparib) for mTNBC, notably delivered
via a sequential dosing schedule to minimize toxicity and improve the therapeutic window. Here, our team of
clinical, translational, and basic science investigators seeks to move forward the rational therapeutic use of SG
and SG/PARPi, and to discover new combinatorial therapies incorporating SG. Our aims are: i) to establish the
association of therapeutic response with pre-treatment and pharmacodynamic markers of DNA damage and
repair with SG/talazoparib versus SG alone for mTNBC through analysis of clinical trial and other patient
samples; ii) to determine mechanisms of resistance to SG monotherapy and SG/PARPi through CRISPR
screens and analysis of post-progression patient samples, and to test select druggable targets to overcome
them; and iii) to optimize drug scheduling and in vivo efficacy for novel combinations to overcome SG/PARPi
resistance. Collectively, these studies will enable and inform the next generation of mechanism-based
therapeutic trials investigating SG-based combinatorial therapy for patients with mTNBC."
10763003,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal describes a 5-year training award to develop the academic career of the principal
investigator, Melanie C. Dispenza, MD, PhD, a board-certified allergist-immunologist at the Northwestern
University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her qualifications and background, combined with her current research
in preventing IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, make her uniquely qualified to study novel
therapies to prevent anaphylaxis. During the period of this proposal, Dr. Dispenza will continue to devote at least
75% effort towards patient-oriented translational research.
 Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening IgE-mediated systemic allergic reaction with no known
preventative therapies. There is a huge unmet need for therapies that can reduce the frequency and/or severity
of anaphylactic reactions from both accidental and intentional exposures, the latter including desensitizations
and immunotherapy. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of FcεRI signaling in human mast cells
and basophils. Pharmacologic inhibitors of BTK are generally well tolerated, and preliminary data show that BTK
inhibitors effectively block IgE-mediated human mast cell and basophil activation in vitro and in mouse models
of anaphylaxis in vivo. Thus, it may be possible to utilize BTK inhibitors to proactively prevent allergic reactions
including anaphylaxis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that short-term use of FDA-approved BTK
inhibitors such as ibrutinib will prevent medication-induced anaphylaxis in both mouse models of anaphylaxis
and in humans. If successful, BTK inhibitors could potentially be used to make drug desensitization safer and
more cost effective, thus improving patient care and outcomes.
 Through this proposed research, Dr. Dispenza will work towards her long-term goal of becoming an
independent translational physician-scientist. Short-term goals include (1) expanding research skills in mast cell
biology, (2) learning to implement novel humanized mouse models of anaphylaxis, and (3) acquiring biostatistical
and clinical trial skills for study design and implementation. After completion of this award, Dr. Dispenza will
have had the needed training to design and implement further studies on the development of novel strategies to
prevent anaphylaxis. To achieve these goals, an excellent mentoring team has been assembled. The primary
mentor, Bruce Bochner, MD (Professor, Division of Allergy-Immunology, Department of Medicine), has a strong
track record of translational research in allergy including mast cell biology and has successfully trained many
academicians. Donald MacGlashan, Jr, MD, PhD (Director, Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Johns
Hopkins University), will serve as co-mentor, with additional expertise in mast cell and basophil activation and
signaling. The mentoring team will oversee Dr. Dispenza’s progress in developing the necessary skills in order
to support her transition into an independent investigator."

Depression and anxiety rank among the largest public health burdens worldwide. While effective first-line
treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy have been shown to be effective, there are numerous barriers to
accessing this kind of clinician delivered care (e.g., cost, provider availability, stigma). There is a critical need for
effective and affordable interventions that can scale and provide mental health support for the millions of
individuals around the world with depression and anxiety who are currently underserved. The Phase I project
focused on the development and feasibility of Cognitive Behavioral Immersion™ (CBI), defined as the delivery
of cognitive behavioral skills training by peer-based coaches in the metaverse. CBI has the potential to deliver
effective, affordable, and scalable support to those with depression and anxiety. While there is initial evidence
supporting the feasibility of CBI for depression and anxiety, a direct comparison of this modality against its
absence or another effective treatment has yet to be conducted and its relative efficacy is unknown. In addition,
it is unknown whether immersive virtual reality confers benefits in cognitive behavioral skill training above and
beyond flat screens accessing the same content. The proposed Phase II project aims to evaluate the efficacy of
an immersive CBI program accessed via VR headsets (CBI-VR) as compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU)
control and a non-immersive CBI condition accessed via flat screens (CBI-flat screen) in a randomized controlled
trial. Upon completion of this aim, the proposed project will have further developed the CBI platform as well as
tested the efficacy of this program. This will help with eventual partnerships with larger payers and employee
assistance programs. The proposed project will also enhance the value proposition for both direct to consumer
and business to business phases."

The P01 Transgenic Core (PI – Bradford Lowell, BIDMC) will work with the Food Allergy P01 investigators to
create genetically engineered mice as outlined in their three projects. A complete suite of services are
available, including the ability to engineer transgenic, gene knockout and gene knockin mice. Two common
forms of gene knockin mice include recombinase driver mice and mice bearing lox-modified alleles. For
recombinase-driver mice, “marker” genes known to be neuron subtype- or cell subtype-specific, are
engineered to drive expression of DNA recombinases (e.g. Cre recombinase). Once generated, such mice are
used with recombinase-dependent tools to monitor, map and manipulate the unique subtypes of neurons and
cells. In the case of mice bearing lox-modified alleles, functionally important genes are engineered to be
flanked by lox sites. This makes it possible to selectively delete that gene from any cre-expressing neuron or

Renal function is dependent on an organized vascular network which coordinates with renal nerves to maintain
mammalian homeostasis. Despite their physiological significance, our understanding of how these networks
are established and influence kidney development are extremely limited. Our long-term goal is to dissect
neurovascular network formation and function during kidney development and apply these principles to
understanding and treating kidney disease. We hypothesize that patterned neurovascular networks modulate
kidney development through the localized release of signaling molecules. We rationalize that disruptions to
normal neurovascular form and function will have implications for kidney development and physiology. This is
significant to conditions such as congenital anomalies and neonatal acute kidney injury which could perturbate
developing neurovascular networks and contribute to disease progression. To this end, we have pioneered
efforts to interrogate the role of neurovascular networks in the developing mouse kidney. We have found that
ablating nerves and disrupting the patterning of neurovascular networks results in hypoplastic kidneys with
abnormal development. We predict that neurovascular cells release signaling factors that regulate kidney
development and have identified candidate factors. Our proposal aims to: 1) determine how nerves mediate
kidney development; 2) interrogate the role of neurovascular patterning in kidney development and implications
for function; 3) investigate how neurovascular produced signals promote kidney development. We will utilize a
combination of genetic mouse and human kidney organoid models, state-of-the-art imaging techniques,
quantitative analyses, and various modern and novel methodologies to carry out our investigations and gain
mechanistic insights. Adult renal physiology will be analyzed to understand how developmental phenotypes
correlate and lead to compromised function. Together, our findings will provide novel insights and advance our
understanding of the coordinated cellular functions required to establish a proper, functional kidney. Current
treatment options for patients with advanced kidney disease are limited to dialysis and transplant. Clearly, new
therapeutic strategies are necessary. Being able to engineer transplantable kidneys ex vivo or
regenerate/repair them in vivo would help alleviate the need for dialysis and donor organs which are in short
supply. However, to accomplish such feats requires a thorough understanding of how kidneys are formed
during development, and the cellular interactions which drive this process which includes neurovascular
networks."
10763431,"Summary
 The overarching goal of my laboratory is to define the functions and mechanisms of a group of non-
coding RNAs (ncRNAs): the small nuclear, U-rich RNAs (snRNAs). Cellular snRNAs associate with Sm proteins
to form ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) that are essential components of cellular machineries responsible for
the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing steps of splicing and 3¢-end formation, and their
perturbation underlies several diseases. Recent research from my lab and others suggests that this group of
ncRNAs is more functionally diverse than previously thought and that the canonical functions of snRNAs in
splicing and 3¢-end processing constitute only the tip of the iceberg.
 Using Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) as a model system, we recently showed that snRNAs perform functions
beyond pre-mRNA processing. This primate g-herpesvirus expresses seven snRNAs in latently infected cells
called HSURs (Herpesvirus saimiri U-rich RNAs). We have focused on two of these ncRNAs, HSURs 1 and 2,
because they are the most highly conserved HSURs among different HVS groups and the only two expressed
by the related Herpesvirus ateles. HSUR1 and HSUR2 basepair with host microRNAs (miRNAs) and target one
miRNA, miR-27, for degradation. Work from our laboratory showed that HSUR2 also basepairs with host mRNAs
and links bound miRNAs with specific mRNAs to destabilize them. This constitutes the first example of an snRNA
function after pre-mRNA processing. We also developed iRICC, a technique to determine RNA binding partners
of a single RNA of interest and the sequences mediating RNA-RNA interactions in vivo. Using iRICC we showed
that HSUR2 binding sites reside mostly in the 3¢ untranslated regions (3¢UTRs) of target mRNAs. We also
showed that HSUR2 does not present a “seed” or specialized region that is used to interact with most targets,
but rather acts as a flexible adaptor that interacts through different base-pairing arrangements with different
mRNAs. iRICC revealed that HSUR1 profusely binds to coding sequences in addition to 3¢UTRs of target
mRNAs. These findings suggest that HSUR1 might regulate host gene expression through mechanisms different
from those employed by HSUR2. Finally, we have also developed an approach for identifying low-abundance
snRNAs and discovered that mammalian cells express previously uncharacterized snRNAs.
 We will use a combination of genetic, genome-wide, molecular biology and biochemical approaches to
further characterize mechanical aspects of HSUR1 and HSUR2 function and to functionally characterize novel
cellular snRNAs. This work will advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of
gene expression by this class on ncRNAs during viral infection. It will also illuminate novel mechanisms of
gene regulation in the broad range of eukaryotes that express snRNAs."
10763472,"Project Abstract/Summary Project #3
The incidence of serious infections, including pneumonia, by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
(CRAB) and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is rising. Infections caused by CRAB and
CRKP are associated with high rates of treatment failure and mortality because only a limited number of
antibiotics are active against these multi-drug resistant bacteria and these microbes often become resistant to
the prescribed antibiotics during the treatment course. This Project will leverage mechanistic assays from our
Gram-negative Toolbox for a novel murine pneumonia model in which antibiotic-directed bacterial killing and
resistance amplification/suppression can be quantified to rationally optimize combination dosage regimens. We
will prospectively validate the efficacy of these regimens to combat CRAB and CRKP and will counter-select for
resistance. Our overarching hypothesis is that highly effective therapy for CRAB and CRKP infections requires
combination regimens that maximize bacterial killing and suppress resistance emergence. We further
hypothesize that the immune system plays an important role in enhancing bacterial killing and suppressing
resistance in a mouse pneumoniae model. To show this, we will utilize both a neutropenic and a novel
immunocompetent murine model of pneumonia. We hypothesize that it is critical to achieve rapid and extensive
initial bacterial killing by rationally optimized antibiotic combination therapies, in order to unleash the effects of
granulocytes. The mechanistic insights from Project #1 and the Mechanistic Assay Core #2 will provide an
innovative, rational path for building highly effective combination dosage regimens. These will be prospectively
validated using dynamic in vitro infection models (i.e. the hollow fiber system) in Project #2. The present project
provides a second stage in vivo validation in novel mouse pneumonia models. Taken together, this highly
integrated approach will allow us to translate mechanistic insights from our latest Gram-negative toolbox assays
via the hollow fiber and murine infection models to robust and efficacious dosage regimens against CRAB and
CRKP for future testing in clinical trials. We will employ humanized dosage regimens in mice to mirror the plasma
concentration time profiles in humans. All data from our mechanistic assays and our in vitro and mouse infection
models will be integrated into translational mathematical pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic models by the
Mathematical Modeling Core #3. This integrated approach will provide robust and efficacious antibiotic
combination dosage regimens that maximize bacterial killing, suppress resistance, and leverage the effect of the
immune system involving available antibiotics and those in clinical drug development. These mechanistically
optimized regimens will make a tangible difference of combating CRAB and CRKP for years to come."

unique training opportunity in public health. Trainees will acquire research skills and translational training
surrounding the environmental problems associated with inorganic arsenic (iAs) contamination of groundwater
in North Carolina and exposure-related metabolic disorder/diabetes. It provides one-of-a-kind training
opportunities to understand the sources of iAs, the relation of iAs levels to geochemical factors in NC, the

10774722,"Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI),
characterized by pain, sensory deficits, fine motor dysfunction, and impaired gait and balance. Individuals with
DCM report upper limb functional deficits as particularly disabling due to decreased independence and quality
of life. Although surgical spinal cord decompression is the primary treatment of DCM and leads to functional
improvements for most patients, over 30%, do not achieve meaningful clinical recovery of motor function, and
over 40% report substantial residual impairment. Currently, no subsequent strategies are available to improve
neurological recovery following surgical intervention; as such, patients may continue to live with a disability.
Changes in neural circuits governing forelimb function in DCM are unknown. This knowledge gap impedes the
development of treatments to improve upper limb function after decompression surgery. Targeted
neuromodulation of spinal interneurons (INs) is a potential therapeutic strategy for DCM that is expected to
enhance forelimb function. V2a and dI3, genetically-defined spinal interneuron populations, have been shown to
play critical roles in integrating supraspinal, proprioceptive, and cutaneous sensory inputs in forelimb reaching
and grasping tasks.
Further, recent data demonstrate that spinal dI3 INs are crucial during neonatal development of motor circuits
and following SCI. As such, we hypothesize that following surgical decompression, activation of dI3 INs is
necessary for the recovery of forelimb function, and stimulation of these INs will enhance forelimb recovery. Aim
1 will determine the changes in descending cortical and peripheral sensory input onto cervical dI3 INs associated
with forelimb deficits in a mouse model of DCM. In Aim 2, we determine if dI3 INs underpin plasticity in forelimb
function that occurs after DCM and after surgical decompression. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the efficacy of
stimulating cervical dI3 INs in enhancing forepaw motor recovery following decompressive surgery.
The current proposal will be the first to determine how the neuronal integration of dI3 INs is altered in DCM such
that dI3 INs become a necessary component of the grasping function in DCM. The successful completion of this
project will guide future research by (1) determining the plasticity of dI3 INs within the forelimb neural network in
DCM, (2) uncovering the sensorimotor mechanism associated with dI3 neuronal plasticity in DCM, and (3)
demonstrating the efficacy of targeted neuromodulation as a promising treatment strategy for DCM. We expect
our results to facilitate the development of neuromodulation treatments to augment recovery of upper limb
function after surgery for DCM."
10936521,"Project Summary
The prevailing neuroscientific characterization of addiction is that of evolving neuro-behavioral responses to
chronic drug use that are initially motivated by increasing pleasure (impulsive drug use) that over time causes
neuro-adaptations such that drug use is increasingly motivated by relief from negative affect (compulsive use).
The compulsive stage of addiction can be seen as a “vicious cycle” since the short-term relief from negative
affect through drug use ultimately exacerbates negative affect through neuroadaptations to chronic use. Our
early work demonstrated that the vicious cycle was a primary factor in maintaining comorbidity between alcohol
use disorder (AUD) and internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression). This provided the ground work for the
development and validation of a cognitive-behavioral therapy program for AUD comorbidity that directly
targeted the vicious cycle of addiction (VC-CBT). Further, we developed a fully autonomous and easily scaled
digital platform to deliver VC-CBT that has proved to be as effective as the therapist-delivered version. The
intervention is premised on educating individuals about the reversibility of the vicious cycle, and training them
to use proven coping skills to manage negative affect without drugs can significantly aid them in achieving
desired treatment goals. In this project, we leverage the trans-addiction status of the neuroscientific
underpinnings of the VC-CBT intervention and its flexibility as a digital therapeutic to develop and test a digital
treatment for comorbidity in opioid use disorder (OUD). Relative to other drugs of abuse, the progression from
initial impulsive use to negatively reinforced compulsive use is known to be truncated and nearly universal
among those who routinely use opioids, and those with co-occurring internalizing disorders are especially
susceptible. This, along with the relatively high lethality of OUD, makes it an ideal near-term target for this
trans-addiction therapy. To achieve this, we propose to test the clinical efficacy of digitally-delivered VC-CBT
for OUD-INTD comorbidity in a UG3/UH3 program consisting of two phases. The overarching aim of Phase 1
is the modification and pilot testing of the established digitally-delivered negative affect VC-CBT for application
in OUD. The overarching aim of Phase 2 is to conduct a scientifically rigorous clinical trial of the modified VC-
CBT for OUD. The impact of this work would be to provide a scalable and inexpensive means of improving the
otherwise poor OUD treatment outcomes among those with co-occurring anxiety or depression. Moreover, the
project would support the viability of trans-addiction interventions that target processes common to multiple
addiction types."
10781935,"ABSTRACT
We previously identified the TP53-R337H founder mutation in a group of Brazilian children who
developed adrenocortical carcinoma. A general population screen of 175,000 newborns
demonstrated that 1 in 375 individuals from southern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and
Parana, total population 80-100 million) are carriers of this mutation. Surprisingly many of these
carriers are at low risk of cancer and remain tumor free. Subsequent genomic analyses identified
a nonsense mutation in the putative tumor suppressor XAF1 (E134*) in linkage with the TP53-
R337H mutation in a subset of carriers. XAF1 is also reported to function in apoptosis within a
positive feedback loop with p53, and its expression is frequently selected against by epigenetic
silencing in a broad range of human tumors. Based on these findings we propose that XAF1-
E134* cooperates with p53-R337H in promoting tumorigenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis
we found that the double mutant haplotype is significantly enriched in carriers who developed
cancer in general, sarcomas and multiple tumors. Building upon these observations we will study
the physiological role of XAF1 in apoptosis and tumor suppression and whether the nonsense
mutation cooperates with the TP53-R337H mutation in promoting tumorigenesis using knockin
and knockout mouse models. We will address these questions in the following two Specific Aims:
1) Does XAF1 function as a physiologic proapoptotic tumor suppressor? and 2) Do XAF1-
E134* and TP53-R337H cooperate to enhance tumor susceptibility?
Together, these studies will establish how these mutations interact, and explain the high tumor
incidence in individuals carrying both mutations. In doing so, we will more generally address the
disparities in outcome among individuals carrying the same p53 mutation."
10931674,"Imaging techniques that can enhance tumor contrast against non-specific background can
significantly impact diagnostic and surgical applications in oncology. Fluorescence optical imaging is
being evaluated for disease diagnosis and surgical treatment, using probes that either preferentially
accumulate in tumors, or are antibody conjugated to label tumor-specific receptors. While there has
been a significant progress in the development of molecularly targeted near infrared fluorescent
probes, background fluorescence from non-specific probe accumulation remains a major confound
that reduces sensitivity and specificity for tumor detection. Even when the probe clearance is rapid,
tissue autofluorescence can be significant compared to the tumor fluorescence. Existing clinical
optical imaging systems primarily employ fluorescence intensity-based imaging. Fluorescence
intensity strongly depends on tissue attenuation and experimental factors such as excitation light
intensity, and therefore cannot distinguish tumor bound probe from non-specific probe or tissue
autofluorescence on an absolute scale. Our preclinical and clinical studies indicate that the
fluorescence lifetimes of tumor and normal tissue in subjects injected with cancer targeted probes are
distinct and independent of experimental parameters under typical conditions. We have shown that
this FLT contrast dramatically improves the accuracy for tumor vs. normal classification compared to
intensity-based imaging using the FDA-approved near infrared fluorescent dye, Indocyanine green
(ICG). Building on this exciting finding, the goal of this proposal is to robustly validate fluorescence
lifetime as a contrast mechanism for tumor identification in oral cancers using ICG. We will develop a
portable time domain imaging system for concurrent intraoperative imaging and surgical specimen
mapping and optimize the system using preclinical models. Subsequently, we will validate the system
for intraoperative imaging and specimen margin assessment using clinical studies in head and neck
cancer surgery patients systemically injected with ICG, and determine the dosage and injection time
points that provide optimal accuracy for tumor vs normal classification. This proposal will also lead to
future applications of lifetime contrast to enhance accuracy of tumor detection in other cancers, using
ICG and novel cancer targeted probes currently under development."
10778105,"For an organism to survive, its proteins must adopt a diversity of conformations in a challenging
environment where macromolecular crowding can derail even robust biological pathways. This
situation becomes critical when considering proteins with energetic folding landscapes that
permit many conformational states. In these cases, the environment can clearly influence the
conformation by favoring one pathway over another. Because the aggregating proteins that are
responsible for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases often
have identical sequences in healthy and diseased individuals, differences in cellular
environment are responsible for the conformational switch. Yet, despite the importance of the
environment for protein folding, structural investigations of biomolecules are typically confined to
in vitro systems, which cannot capture important structural features imposed by biological
environments. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is currently undergoing a “sensitivity renaissance”
with the development of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Experiments that would require
decades of experimental time with traditional ssNMR methods can be collected in a day with
DNP NMR. Moreover, while most structural biology approaches require purified samples, NMR
spectroscopy does not. Because NMR reports quantitatively on the relative populations - with
atomic level precision - it can report on the identity and relative abundance of structural
polymorphs. Here, we will capitalize on the methodology for in cell structural biology using DNP-
assisted NMR we have developed in our group to determine if and how biological settings
influence the conformations of both the highly ordered and intrinsically disordered regions with
atomic level precision."
10775874,"Hypertension, a leading risk factor for death, impacts 40% of American women but is far more frequent after
menopause. Postmenopausal hypertension is largely related to the pronounced decline in circulating estrogen
associated with menopause, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain incompletely defined. In addition to
activating the classical estrogen receptors (ER and ERβ), estrogen activates the G protein-coupled estrogen
receptor 1 (GPER1), which elicits cardiovascular protective actions. Our preliminary data uncovered that (1)
aged female global GPER1-knockout (GPER1 KO) mice have higher blood pressure than wild-type littermates
do, and (2) GPER1 regulates renal endothelin-1 signaling and the activity of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), a
major regulator of natriuresis and, thereby, blood pressure. To further investigate the GPER1-ENaC interaction,
we generated mice with GPER1 deletion specifically in renal collecting duct principal cells (PC-GPER1 KO mice).
Patch clamp electrophysiology experiments revealed greater ENaC activity in collecting ducts isolated from PC-
GPER1 KO female mice. Conversely, pharmacologic activation of GPER1 downregulated ENaC activity in
collecting ducts obtained from wild-type female mice. In aged GPER1 KO mice, prior pregnancy resulted in lower
blood pressure, increased plasma E2 level and decreased adrenal production of aldosterone, which also
regulates ENaC and blood pressure. In line with this finding, estrogen-mediated activation of adrenal ERβ has
been shown to blunt aldosterone biosynthesis when GPER1 is silenced. Of note, most animal research with
females utilizes virgin animals, which does not represent the overall female population, and the impact of
uncomplicated pregnancy on later maternal blood pressure is unclear. Our preliminary data suggest GPER1
signaling may contribute to the later-in-life cardiovascular benefits of pregnancy previously observed in
longitudinal studies of women. We hypothesize that GPER1 signaling and prior pregnancies elicit blood pressure
-lowering actions in aged females by downregulating ENaC via regulation of ET-1 and aldosterone, respectively.
AIM 1 of our study will determine whether GPER1 activation lowers blood pressure by downregulating collecting
duct ENaC in aged female mice. AIM 2 will determine whether prior pregnancy lowers blood pressure in global
GPER1 KO mice by improving ovarian function and downregulating aldosterone signaling. Simultaneously, using
existing human genotyping, reproductive history and prospectively collected blood pressure data in BioVU,
Vanderbilt University Medical Center's vast DNA repository, AIM 3 will examine the associations of candidate
genetic variants of GPER1 and parity with blood pressure in postmenopausal nulliparous and parous women.
Successful completion of the current studies will likely justify the development of antihypertensive therapeutics
that target GPER1 for postmenopausal hypertension. Furthermore, the proposed studies will improve our
understanding of the long-term effects of uncomplicated pregnancy on maternal blood pressure, which will
consequently improve personalized cardiovascular care for nulliparous and parous women."

Osteoclasts are large, myeloid-derived multinucleated cells primarily responsible for bone resorption.
Dysregulation of osteoclast differentiation can result in net bone resorption and is key to the pathophysiology of
osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lytic bone metastasis. Despite substantial advances in the identification
of osteoclast master regulators, developing therapeutic interventions for pathologic osteoclasts has been
challenging due to off-target/side effects. Thus, we hypothesized that a better understanding of osteoclast-
specific regulation can directly lead to the development of novel osteoclast-specific therapeutic strategies to
prevent or halt the disease’s progression. Osteoclast gene transcription is highly organized and is understood
to be driven by enhancers. In order to identify osteoclast-specific epigenetic programs, we focused on super-
enhancers. Super-enhancers are clusters of enhancers that have been proposed to regulate key genes of
cellular identity and fate. We found 348 super-enhancers in human osteoclasts through genome-wide analysis
of differential transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We also found that RANKL-regulated super-enhancers
are specific to osteoclasts but do not present in other types of cells. To increase the feasibility of targeting
these super-enhancers, we identified a new class of non-coding RNAs transcribed from super-enhancers
(named Oslincs) in human osteoclasts and provided evidence showing the role of Oslincs in gene expression
and osteoclastogenesis. In this application, we aim to characterize osteoclast-specific programs by
investigating Oslincs’ action and biogenesis in health and disease. Our specific aims are to 1) determine the
underlying mechanism of Oslincs’ function, 2) elucidate the mechanisms by which the expression of Oslincs is
regulated, and 3) identify Oslincs that are differentially regulated between healthy controls and patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We anticipate that the new information generated by this proposal will illuminate
osteoclast-specific regulation and allow us to explore the implementation of novel, targeted therapeutic
approaches for ameliorating the course of pathological bone loss."
10771973,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The average duration of cold-storage for deceased-donor kidneys in the U.S. can range from ~9 to >30 hrs in
the U.S. depending on geographic location. It is well established that the longer a kidney is stored cold prior to
transplant, the greater the likelihood of post-transplant complications like delayed graft function. This is
particularly true for organs from aging donors or donors with co-morbidities—an ever-expanding proportion of
the U.S. donor pool—which display increased sensitivity to injury during cold storage. Little is known about the
mechanisms that determine the rate and extent of cold-storage injury in human organs. This lack of knowledge
presents a critical barrier to the development of therapeutic strategies to reduce the clinical impact of cold-storage
injury. We have recently discovered that cold storage induces human kidneys to produce fibrinogen within renal
tubular cells. Upon restoration of normothermia/normoxia, fibrinogen is secreted into the vasculature where it
can aggregate erythrocytes in a rouleaux formation leading to pathologic plugging of microvessels. We
hypothesize that renal fibrinogen is a major effector of cold-storage injury and therefore represents a viable target
to improve organ resilience after cold storage. Ex Vivo Organ Perfusion (EVOP) has emerged as a research and
clinical platform providing an opportunity to directly test this hypothesis in a translationally relevant setting. Here,
we will exclusively use human tissues to achieve two objectives: 1) Determine the mechanism by which cold-
storage induces renal fibrinogen synthesis; and 2) Evaluate EVOP as a therapeutic platform to ameliorate
fibrinogen-mediated pathology pre-transplant. Successful completion of these objectives will establish a new
paradigm for prevention of cold-storage-induced organ injury with the potential to save patient lives by improving
both access to organs and post-transplant outcomes."

(INSPIRE) will develop, implement and test a modular learning intervention, anchored in simulation training, for
interprofessional members of the healthcare team to reduce bias related to SUD in pregnancy. A robust train-
the-trainer curriculum will allow us to implement the program across the state and reach rural communities.
Project 3 (MEMORIES) will refine and test an expanded informant interview tool to ascertain community and
systems contributions to maternal deaths, and the role of discrimination in deaths from SUD. The tool will then
be disseminated nationally to Maternal Mortality Review Committees.
Our ELEVATE Center aims are to: (1) provide integrated and efficient leadership of the three proposed
projects, maximizing coordination with community partners and incorporating research training across all
elements of the ELEVATE Center; (2) mature our existing community partnerships and statewide networks in
order to facilitate future implementation science and effectiveness trials to reduce maternal morbidity and
mortality in Utah, and (3) reduce maternal morbidity in Utah and nationally through implementation of
community-driven interventions and training of health care practitioners.
The ELEVATE Center will rigorously investigate and identify contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality
from SUD with a focus on rural and Native populations. The multipronged approach of the ELEVATE Center
will reduce maternal morbidity from substance use in Utah while training the next generation of scientists
focused on morbidity reduction. Our efforts can ultimately be expanded nationally to address a leading cause
of pregnancy-associated death in the U.S."
10908713,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1 CEREMONY
Pregnant and postpartum American Indian and Alaska Native people (Native mothers) face a more than two-
fold higher risk of maternal mortality compared to non-Hispanic White mothers. Deaths related to substance
use (SU) and mental health conditions reflect a leading cause of preventable maternal mortality,
including among Native mothers, making these conditions a strong target for reducing maternal mortality
and morbidity. The Utah Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) has identified access to substance use
disorder (SUD) treatment including medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), mental health care, improved
social support, decreased stigma against SUD, and care coordination, particularly in the postpartum period
(when the majority of deaths occur) as actionable intervention points. The objective of our study, Culturally-
Engaged REcovery – MOms connected through Native CommunitY (CEREMONY), is to adapt evidence-based
perinatal care models that integrate pregnancy and postpartum care with SU/SUD treatment and care to meet
the needs of Native mothers. With our partners at Sacred Circle Clinic, a federal Tribal Contract clinic operated
by the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, we are uniquely poised to respond to the expressed
needs of Native mothers and stakeholders, who identified a lack of culturally-integrated SUD care as a
significant gap in perinatal care for Native mothers. We will do this by building upon the strong, evidence-
based foundation of our University of Utah integrated perinatal SUD clinic called Substance Use and
Pregnancy – Recovery, Addiction, and Dependence (SUPeRAD). The SUPeRAD model directly addresses the
actionable intervention points identified by the MMRC to prevent SUD-related maternal deaths, but is not
specifically adapted to Native mothers’ needs. The rationale for this study is that there is a critical knowledge
gap in the adaptation and implementation of integrated perinatal SUD care specifically for Native
mothers. The CEREMONY study will fill this gap by adapting the SUPeRAD clinic model to the needs of
Native mothers using the validated ADAPT-ITT adaptation framework, informed by human centered design
and community-based participatory research (Aim 1); and then testing the adapted, culturally-integrated
perinatal SUD care intervention at Sacred Circle Clinic using a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation
study (Aim 2a&b). The Hybrid Type 1 design will provide important, reliable data on the clinical effectiveness of
culturally adapted perinatal SUD care for Native mothers (Aim 2a) while also producing novel data on the
implementation process (Aim 2b). Successful completion of these Aims will provide implementation and
training protocols that can be used to guide adaptation and implementation of culturally-adapted perinatal SUD
care in other settings across the US. Our study is innovative and significant because it employs strong
community engagement principles and a robust implementation science approach to produce novel clinical
effectiveness and implementation data that can be rapidly disseminated to dramatically improve the care of
Native mothers with SUD and reduce risks for maternal mortality and morbidity."
10908718,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2 INSPIRE
Individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) face a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality.
Provider bias and stigma contribute to these outcomes by attenuating the provision of evidence-based, person-
centered care. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate INSPIRE, an intervention for interprofessional
healthcare teams to improve care for individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) during their peri-delivery
care. INSPIRE is envisioned as a modular intervention, adaptive to the needs of individual providers. It will
include three core modules (a webinar on SUD in birth, an in-person simulation training, and patient vignettes
with real-time feedback on clinical empathy skills using artificial intelligence technology). Booster modules will
be delivered based on provider response across core constructs (bias, burnout, clinical empathy). In AIM 1, we
will use rigorous qualitative methods to examine bias and stigma in obstetric care for pregnant and birthing
individuals with SUD from provider and patient perspectives. In AIM 2, we will apply these data to develop the
INSPIRE intervention. Working with a stakeholder advisory board, we will adapt simulation training curricula for
the SUD context, and develop additional modules focused on clinical empathy, bias and stigma, and burnout.
Using human centered design principles, we will prototype modules with facilities around the state of Utah. In
AIM 3, we will evaluate INSPIRE at the University of Utah hospital using a quasi-experimental design to
determine: a) impact on healthcare team outcomes, b) impact on patient outcomes, and c) potential for
scalability. We will enroll 400 healthcare team members across clinical specialties that support birthing
individuals. All enrolled providers will receive INSPIRE, and assessments will be conducted at baseline, 2
months, and 6 months. The primary outcome for providers is bias, using the Medical Conditions Regard Scale
(MCRS). We will assess change in MCRS scores from baseline to 6 months using a mixed effects linear
regression model, specified to provide a paired-sample comparison between pre- and post-intervention scores.
To assess patient level outcomes, we will enroll patients with SUD giving birth in two time periods: pre-
intervention (n=100) and post-intervention (n=100). Patient surveys will be conducted in person, prior to
discharge from labor and delivery, and medical record data will be abstracted up to 6 months postpartum. The
primary outcome for patients will be self-reported Person-Centered Maternity Care (PCMC). We will use linear
regression to examine differences in PCMC scores between baseline and endline, controlling for potential
confounders. We will apply the RE-AIM implementation science framework to assess potential for program
scale-up. In Years 6-7, we will support the ELEVATE Center in statewide dissemination and implementation of
INSPIRE. We will train facility-level champions in clinical settings across the state and support the Center to
collect robust implementation data to document the uptake and adaptations of INSPIRE across unique clinical
environments."

As the progress on the development of biosensors, genetic control tools and genetic circuits in the past few years
enabled advanced and sophisticated dynamic control of biosynthesis for optimal production performance in
bacteria, its lack of broad applicability in enhancing natural product biosynthesis is becoming into a major
problem since such dynamic control highly relies on specific biosensors. However, such biosensors are not
always available for most natural products. Within this MIRA research program, the PI aims to bridge these gaps
by developing platforms with broad applicability in improving biosynthesis of a broad spectrum of natural products
including polysaccharides, terpenoids and plant polyketides in bacteria. To reach this goal, the following four
coherent themes will be investigated: 1) engineering and characterizing a series of biosensors for monitoring
and responding to central metabolism in bacteria; 2) developing dynamic control strategies to manage conflict
between growth and production, which can serve as a platform to support efficient biosynthesis of
polysaccharides, human milk oligosaccharides and glycosylated compounds; 3) developing dynamic control
strategies to improve product yield by reducing carbon loss, which can serve as a platform to support high-level
biosynthesis of terpenoids and many other acetyl-CoA derived products; 4) developing dynamic control
strategies to coordinate precursor supplies, which could serve as a platform to support efficient biosynthesis of
plant polyketides. The proposed research program is expected to advance dynamic control of natural product
biosynthesis in bacteria to a whole new level. With these studies, we will greatly enhance the availability of
biosensors targeting central metabolism. We will gain new insights into carbon flux distribution in cellular
metabolism at various conditions through biosensor-aided observation and further understand the interaction of
central metabolism with heterologous biosynthesis during the dynamic processes. Furthermore, the knowledge
gained in this research program will continue to advance the understanding of how to seamlessly implement
artificial logics and functions in native cellular context."

mRNA-based vaccines use lipid nanoparticles to transport mRNA-encoding antigens to the host cells. We have
recently shown that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in humans induces a robust plasmablast response in blood
and a persistent GC reaction in the draining lymph nodes. This corresponded with enhanced anti-spike antibody
avidity in blood and enhanced affinity and neutralization capacity of bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC)-derived
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). mRNA-based influenza vaccines could be a promising alternative to conventional
influenza vaccine platforms because of their high immunogenicity. The following questions, however, are yet to
be addressed: (1) does an mRNA-based influenza vaccination induce a robust and persistent GC reaction in
humans? (2) if yes, what drives such persistence, and how different is that from the GC response induced by
conventional influenza vaccines? (3) can an mRNA-based influenza vaccination induce a robust GC response
in the elderly (>65 years old)? (4) does robust GC response to influenza vaccination in humans correlate with a
more durable antibody response? (5) does an mRNA-based influenza vaccination induce a more sustained
increase in the frequency of long-lived BMPCs compared to conventional vaccines? (6) can a vaccine-induced
robust GC response overcome influenza antigenic imprinting in humans? (7) what are the molecular
determinants that dictate the persistence of BMPCs? Addressing these questions will allow us to discern the
cellular and molecular determinants associated with durable antibody responses to vaccination in humans. We
will directly examine antigen-specific GC and long-lived BMPC responses induced after mRNA-based and
conventional influenza vaccination in humans in the proposed studies. These responses will be examined in 18-
50 year-old and 65-80 year-old human adults. We will assess the persistence of the vaccine antigen in draining
lymph nodes as a potential mechanism for driving GC longevity in humans. We will examine how robust GC B
cell responses to influenza vaccination in humans could overcome antigenic imprinting and if that correlates with
a more durable antibody response. Finally, we will genetically analyze the mechanisms of action of the
transcriptional determinants that are preferentially expressed in plasma cells destined for longevity. Our findings
will potentially reveal the cellular and molecular determinants dictating the longevity and the breadth of elicited
antibody responses to influenza – and potentially other – vaccination in humans."

Title: Advanced Single-Cell Protein Analysis with Multiplex in Situ Tagging Array Technology
Single-cell analysis has been the essential approach in understanding cellular machinery, organism development,
and disease mechanisms. Proteins are naturally one of the main targets in single-cell analysis since proteins are
responsible for nearly every task for the cellular life. Unfortunately, proteins are not amplifiable like DNA, and
thus the minuscule amount of proteins on single cells poses a great challenge to the detection techniques. To
date, there is still no single-cell proteome technology available yet that has sufficient sensitivity and scale. We
have innovated a few single-cell protein detection techniques on an ultrahigh-density multiplex in situ tagging
(MIST) array which demonstrates its power for not only analyzing the full spectrum of function proteome in animal
and human cells, but also rapidly detecting cluster of surface proteins on smaller microbial pathogens. The MIST
array is a large-scale monolayer of small-size microbeads with a density much higher than most genome chips,
and the microbeads carry various probes for protein detection. The single-cell MIST (scMIST) technology has
exhibited it ability to quantify in single cells up to 465 functional proteins, which is the highest multiplexity assay
and the most comprehensive mapping of T cell protein markers. The smaller scale of the assay proved its utility
in prediction of sepsis outcomes by analyzing large quantity of primary samples. In the proposed research, we
will extend scMIST to spatially analyze solid tissue specimens by quantifying ~500 functional proteins to
thoroughly assess cellular features, physiological status and functions within a tissue microenvironment. In
addition, we will optimize the scMIST and combine it with artificial intelligence algorithms to precisely prognose
disease occurrence and progression. Last, an explosion-like biomolecular chain reaction will be developed on
the MIST array to rapidly detect few protein copies on single bacteria or viral particles by specifically amplifying
signals for millions to billions of times, with the goal of visually detecting single pathogens within a minute. The
implementation of these advanced single-cell protein detection technologies will catalyze the revolution of
biomedical sciences and fundamentally enhance the precision of disease prognosis. Visual detection of single
pathogens within a minute will bring enormous opportunities in broadly many areas concerned with pathogens."
10763761,"Project Abstract: Investigating the Function of Bacterial Cytoskeletal Elements in the Division and
Growth of the FtsZ-less Chlamydia
 Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a range of serious diseases in
humans. In developed countries, Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted
infections (STI). In developing countries, C. trachomatis is not only a significant cause of STI, but it is also
responsible for the primary cause of infectious preventable blindness, trachoma. The major concern of
chlamydial infections is that they are often asymptomatic and undiagnosed, which can lead to chronic
sequelae. These include pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal factor infertility, and reactive arthritis for C.
trachomatis. Chlamydial diseases remain a significant burden on health care systems around the world.
 In adapting to obligate intracellular growth, Chlamydia has significantly reduced its genome size and
eliminated genes from various pathways as it relies on the host cell for its metabolic needs. One such
“essential” gene that Chlamydia has eliminated is FtsZ, the central organizer of the division septum during
binary fission. A major focus of the lab is to understand how Chlamydia divides. Previously, we have
demonstrated that Chlamydia divides by an MreB-dependent polarized division mechanism that relies, in part,
on the unique N-terminal domain of chlamydial MreB. This pathogen also alternates between different
functional and morphological forms during its normal growth, also referred to as its developmental cycle.
These observations, combined with its obligate intracellular dependence, make Chlamydia a difficult, but
fascinating, organism with which to work. Nonetheless, recent development of genetic tools to mechanistically
study chlamydiae has significantly enhanced our understanding of this pathogen. The current application
goals are designed to leverage prior work investigating the function of chlamydial cytoskeletal elements. Goal
1: We will investigate how MreB is maintained at the division septum after its initial recruitment to a specific
site on the bacterial surface as well as the contributions of various phospholipids to this process. We will also
determine factors that contribute to how daughter cell outgrowth occurs during the budding process. Goal 2:
We will investigate a novel bactofilin cytoskeletal element we identified that functions in maintaining cell size.
We seek to understand its function in regulating cell size in Chlamydia by interrogating specific domains
necessary for its effects and identifying interaction partners that contribute to cell size. We hypothesize that,
given the absence of FtsZ in these organisms and their use of MreB in its place, the mechanisms of cell size
control will be unique in these bacteria. Consequently, our results may lead to the identification of Chlamydia-
unique targets for antimicrobial development. This will limit the impact of broad spectrum antibiotics on the
microbiome during treatment of chlamydia infections. More fundamentally, findings from the proposed
research will enhance our understanding of the evolutionary strategies bacteria employ to regulate a critical
physiological function."

At the excitatory synapse, a heterogenous molecular layout creates a precise pre- and post-synaptic
structure that facilitates different modes of neurotransmission. The spatial segregation of neurotransmission
leads to the autonomous function of spontaneous glutamate release. The investigation into the
structure/function relationship at the excitatory synapse has facilitated the discovery of disease pathways
and targets for psychiatric disease intervention. However, aberrant inhibitory neurotransmission is also
implicated in numerous psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. Despite the
fundamental importance of inhibitory neurotransmission in disease, few studies have investigated the
relationship between nanostructure and function at the inhibitory synapse. My preliminary data suggests a
segregation of action potential dependent and spontaneous neurotransmission at central inhibitory
GABAergic synapses, but how this segregation is achieved is unknown. Few studies have investigated the
inhibitory structure/function relationship due to the limited tools that allow for the selective manipulation of
different modes of inhibitory neurotransmission. I have generated preliminary data that a novel small
molecule drug, Artemisinin, selectively dysregulates inhibitory spontaneous release as it competitively binds
in the GABAAR-gephyrin binding pocket; providing a new pharmacological tool that will be utilized throughout
this proposal. This project will investigate the GABAergic synapse in two-fold by elucidating the post-synaptic
structure that segregates neurotransmission and how this structure leads to an autonomous function of
spontaneous GABAergic transmission in homeostatic plasticity. In primary hippocampal culture, Artemisinin
will be used as a tool to decrease GABAergic spontaneous release to investigate how this corresponds to
nanostructure and signaling pathways. The central hypothesis is GABAergic synapses have a specific post-
synaptic gephyrin scaffold and GABAAR nanostructure that facilitates an autonomous role of spontaneous
neurotransmission. Aim#1 will investigate how the post-synaptic structure segregates neurotransmission
using super resolution and electron microscopy to assess 1a. gephyrin clustering dynamics and 1b. GABAAR
subunit localization and clustering. Aim#2 will investigate the functional pathway this nanostructure
facilitates by delineating the role of spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission in homeostatic plasticity.
2a. First downstream gene expression pathways will be assessed, specifically BDNF expression. 2b. Then
how spontaneous GABAergic signaling alters calcium dynamics to trigger gene transcription pathways will
be delineated. This research will elucidate the relationship between structure and function at the inhibitory
synapse, ultimately providing novel insight into the regulation of synaptic strength underlying
excitatory/inhibitory balance in health and disease."

This Collaborative Merit Review Award for Research (I01) proposed in response to RFA BX-18-007 from the
Veteran Health Administration is a joint effort by investigators from the JJ Peters VA Medical Center (Bronx,
NY) Project 1, Arnold School of Public Health and Wm Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center (Columbia,
SC) Project 2, Brain Science Center VA Medical Center (Minneapolis, MN) Project 3. We define a vision for
an integrated and multidisciplinary program of preclinical research projects all linked by the ultimate goal to
better characterize the mechanism of persistent and aberrant immunological activity in Gulf War Veteran
Illnesses (GWVI) by developing experimental model systems, with the ultimate goal of developing novel
therapeutic interventions. Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses is a multifaceted disorder characterized by a range of
symptoms including cognitive impairment, fatigue, pain, mood disorders, among others. Recent evidence
suggests that the onset and progression of these symptoms may be the result of disequilibrium in these
subjects’ immune systems. During deployment GWV were exposed to a unique variety of toxic agents that
were specific to the Gulf War theatre, such as pyridostigmine bromine (PB), diisopropyl fluorophosphates
(DFP), permethrin, and depleted uranium which current evidence indicates lowered thresholds to
immunological responses and resulted in the persistent and heightened activity of certain arms of the immune
system; a phenomenon best described as “immunological priming”. In addition, they received more than 20
vaccines that could have overloaded the immune system. In support of these considerations, subjects with
GWVI often have shown pathological signatures in common with autoimmune disorders and generalized
inflammatory disorders, such as increased plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, unspecific
tissue degeneration, and organ failure. Based on this concept, the three proposed collaborative research
projects were designed to better understand how primed immune systems may contribute to GWVI- type
phenotypes by exploring how multiple GWI conditions recapitulated in animal models may synergize and
eventually provide new mechanistic evidence for translation studies. For example, Project 2 was designed to
understand how GW toxin induced gut inflammasome activation causes gut dysbiosis and may lead to
persistent or heightened immune-inflammatory responses and GWVI symptoms. As the goal of Project 3 is
designed the hypothesis that lack of specific immunity leads to vaccine-induced inflammatory reaction in the
brain, Project 2 will collaborate with project 3 to test the contribution of inflammasome priming and genetic
diversity to gut dysbiosis and persistent immunological responses. Similarly, Project 1, which is designed to
test how immunological priming may heighten inflammatory responses to psychological stressors, will
collaborate with project 2 and project 3 by exploring how the NLRP3 inflammasome may contribute to
heightened inflammation induced by gut dysbiosis or HLA polymorphisms, respectively. The outcome of
these studies is of great interest not only because this will establish a novel link between inflammasome
priming, genetic diversity and gut-dysbiosis toxemic response, but it will also provide insight to test novel
therapeutic approaches that target the persistent activation of the immune system, either using
immunotherapeutic approaches against vaccine toxins, probiotics to attenuate gut dysbiosis. Our proposed
studies are innovative in terms of their scope, since it will fill the fundamental gaps needed for future
translational studies. Most importantly our multiscale technological innovative approaches, which include
knockout murine models of GWVI, including for the HLA and NLRP3 proteins, will enable our interdisciplinary
research team with outstanding expertise in neuroscience, pharmacology, microbiology, chemistry to
thoroughly investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of GWVI."
10752638,"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) such as retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, cone-rod
dystrophy, and Best macular dystrophy are devastating blinding diseases in people. While mutations in
nearly 270 genes have been associated with different forms of IRDs to date, characterization of disease
mechanisms and identification of therapeutic targets for many of these IRDs are yet to be developed.
Encouraging clinical successes with gene replacement therapy have emerged in recent years for several
forms of IRD in man, and some of these treatments have resulted from proof of principle studies carried out
in dog models by our research group. At the Retinal Disease Study Facility of the University of Pennsylvania,
we have an established research capability and expertise that has allowed us to mechanistically assess over
20 canine strains and their crosses, each of which represent different forms of naturally-occurring IRDs.
Using a subset of these canine models, we aim to better understand the molecular basis and pathogenic
mechanisms of these unique IRDs, and evaluate new therapies to prevent or ameliorate disease. Thus
renewal of the proposed program will allow continued advances in translational studies using canine models
of IRDs, providing a sound basis for future development of new and effective therapies for human retinal
degenerative diseases.
 At our centralized resource facility, we will breed and maintain specific canine IRD strains with rigorously
characterized phenotypes/genotypes. Investigators will be provided with mutant and age-matched control
dogs either for independent or collaborative studies. The aim of these studies is to understand the
molecular mechanisms involved in IRDs, and develop new therapies that can be evaluated on a short- or
long-term basis. This centralized resource will also be used by multiple investigators to accomplish the
research goals of their own NIH-funded grants. Lastly, hypothesis-driven studies by the PIs and
collaborators will be aimed at characterizing new patient-relevant IRD models, studying their underlying
cellular/molecular mechanisms, examining the role of inflammation and microglia/macrophages in IRDs for
the identification of optimal therapeutic targets, optimizing targeting of different retinal cell types such as
ON-bipolar cells, and testing the effect of a new protease in facilitating intravitreal AAV therapies. Our
principal hypothesis is that the collaborative research using canine models from a centralized, well-
maintained resource facility, supported by a team of investigators with expertise in both clinical
ophthalmology and molecular/cell biology, will lead to critical proof-of-principle studies directed at
developing safe and effective new therapies for IRDs in patients. The proposed program and studies are
designed to fully address this hypothesis."

Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW; ages 15-24) in sub-Saharan Africa face a disproportionate burden
of HIV infection. Though highly effective HIV prevention like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is central to the
global strategy for HIV epidemic control, awareness of PrEP among AGYW is low, with uptake and
continuation even lower—health systems are often ill equipped to overcome the numerous access barriers
faced by AGYW, including stigma, harmful norms, and the inconveniences of clinic-based health services.
There is growing recognition that community-based pharmacies have the potential to bridge gaps in HIV
prevention and mitigate access barriers among AGYW. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the Malkia
Klabu (“Queen Club”) implementation strategy in Tanzania, a loyalty program designed for and by AGYW that
creates youth-friendly pharmacies where AGYW can access HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive
health (SRH) services, with strong linkages to facility-based care.
Based on promising data from our pilot study, we hypothesize that the creation of a welcoming and safe
pharmacy environment through the Malkia Klabu implementation model will attract AGYW and bolster uptake
of PrEP, HIV self-testing (HIVST), and other SRH services, thereby empowering AGYW to avoid HIV and
unintended pregnancy. We have designed an innovative, 5-year implementation science study to scale and
evaluate several models of Malkia Klabu’s pharmacy-based approach for PrEP and HIVST delivery in five
research sites in Lake Zone, Tanzania using the RE-AIM framework. This research will be enhanced by
implementation science training of local researchers and policymakers to optimize Malkia Klabu and benefit
future HIV prevention strategies. We will first conduct a Type 3 Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness study of
four pharmacy-based differentiated PrEP delivery models of Malkia Klabu in 50 pharmacies, examining
implementation outcomes before and after the addition of user cost-sharing which is essential for real-world
sustainability (Aim 1). We will examine the success of the Malkia Klabu delivery models on effective use of
PrEP among a cohort of 575 AGYW, reach of the program in a cross-sectional household survey with 750
AGYW in study areas; pharmacy exit surveys with ~200 AGYW will help describe the success of pharmacy-
based PrEP service offerings (Aim 2). A Certificate in Implementation Science coupled with seed grants for
graduates will ensure the project has lasting impact (Aim 3).
At the study’s conclusion, we will determine the strongest and most sustainable version of the Malkia Klabu
implementation strategy for pharmacy-based PrEP and HIVST delivery to AGYW, and launched an
implementation science training program to enable locally-led scaling and adaptation to reach vulnerable
AGYW across Tanzania and the Region. The project is a collaboration between Mzumbe University, Health for
a Prosperous Nation, the Tanzania Ministry of Health, and University of California (San Francisco & Berkeley)."

At the onset of English-dominant schooling, bilinguals with developmental language disorders (DLD) generally
experience a progressive decline in home language use. Yet, theories posit that a bilingual’s two languages
interact in ways that enhance children’s developing language faculty (Hernandez, 2018). To advance new
perspectives on neurodevelopmental disorders of cognitive function and inform clinical approaches for
linguistically-diverse learners, we seek to understand language development in bilingual children with DLD.
Our objective is to uncover how bilingualism impacts language development in children with DLD. Wang et al.
(2021) bridge the Interactive Specialization (Johnson, 2011) and Dual Stream (Poeppel, 2012) frameworks
to conceptualize language development as an interaction between neurocognitive systems competing for
language subfunctions. To examine the effects of bilingualism on DLD, we advance this perspective by linking
it to the view that bilingual experiences influence extrinsic brain-behavior and intrinsic neural interactions
(Hernandez, 2018). We thus hypothesize that added interactivity and competition of two languages will be
positively associated with cortical specialization for language function in bilinguals with DLD.
To test this hypothesis, we focus on syntactic and semantic competences disproportionately affected in DLD.
We use behavioral and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging measures, testing
Spanish-English bilinguals ages 7-9 (N=400, 60 with DLD), in two languages. Sentence judgment and
narrative comprehension tasks are used to uncover cortical specificity along the dorsal and ventral language
neurocircuits. Aim 1 is to determine language-specific effects of bilingualism on the finetuning of cortical
specialization for language function in DLD. Aim 2 is to uncover the global-system effects of bilingualism on
cortical specialization for language in DLD. To achieve these aims, we examine the relation between children’s
syntactic and semantic competences in each language, the relative balance in dual language experiences, and
their interaction with children’s emerging neural architecture for language. This principled approach will provide
an empirical basis to (1) uncover mechanisms that support the advancement of English proficiency in bilinguals
with DLD; (2) advance theories of DLD through neuro-cognitive evidence on language competences most
affected in DLD; (3) inform intervention by illuminating individual differences in the relations between language
experiences, proficiency, and brain development. This evidence will reveal mechanisms by which language
experiences and proficiency interact with DLD, providing theoretically rich and clinically significant information."

It is estimated that more than one million people in the United States identify as transgender. Despite recent
increased visibility, transgender individuals remain marginalized and subject to health disparities, and are
underrepresented in biomedical research. It is well documented that transgender persons are disproportionately
affected by HIV compared to their cisgender counterparts, but the basis for this is incompletely understood. In
particular, we have a very limited understanding of changes in mucosal immune defenses in the vaginal
compartment in transgender men and transmasculine individuals who receive chronic testosterone therapy as
part of gender affirming hormone therapy. This is relevant to understanding HIV risks as transgender men report
heterosexual, non-heterosexual, and bisexual orientation, making transgender men who have sex with cisgender
men a unique and understudied group. Our central hypothesis is that gender affirming hormone therapy in
transgender men leads to a dysregulated innate immune microenvironment and impaired barrier function of the
vaginal mucosal compartment, increasing the risk of HIV transmission during vaginal penetration. The goal of
this project is to characterize the effects of cross hormone therapy on the vaginal compartment using a
commercially available reconstructed vaginal tissue model that has been shown to be hormonally responsive
and support infection with HIV. We propose three aims to test our hypothesis. First, we will characterize the
histology of the testosterone dominant vagina in contrast to the estradiol primed vagina, looking at barrier
function, mucin expression, and steady state cytokine/chemokine release. The effects of testosterone on
colonization with lactobacillus will also be examined. Next, we will conduct transcriptomic studies to identify the
gene expression profile of the testosterone dominant vagina to identify changes in the immunologic signaling
pathways that could negatively impact host-pathogen interactions. Finally, we will examine HIV infection in the
testosterone dominant vagina in comparison to the estradiol primed vagina to determine if HIV transmission is
increased. At the completion of this project, we will have a broader understanding of the histologic and
immunologic effects of testosterone on the vaginal compartment, identifying defensive weaknesses in the
residual lower female genital tract in transgender men with an intact vagina that increase the risk of HIV
transmission. We believe our data will help inform the development of strategies for individuals undergoing
gender affirming hormone therapy to lessen the risk of HIV and other STI acquisition across this mucosal surface."

Today, more than 20 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many exposed community members continue to
have persistent lower airway symptoms with functional abnormalities in large and/or small airways as indicated
by spirometry measures of airflow and/or oscillometry measures of airway heterogeneity. Prior studies and
knowledges have been focused on the health effects of World Trade Center (WTC) exposures on the average
lung function profiles or discrete lung function patterns, however, systematic investigations on the severe
spectrum of the disease are limited. Post-bronchodilator (BD) measurements may identify persistent lung injury
as residual airflow limitation with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life, and thus are important and
clinically relevant parameters to investigate. Moreover, it is of key public health importance to study the
heterogeneous health impacts of the disaster and disparities in healthcare and wellbeing within subgroups. In
this project, we propose to address the important scientific questions related to respiratory disease in WTC
Survivor population and within vulnerable subgroups, through the following aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the
extreme quantiles of cross-sectional measurements of post-BD airway function, including large and small
airway metrics, and their association with WTC exposures and comorbidities. Aim 2: Conduct longitudinal
quantile analysis to investigate WTC exposures and other risk factors as determinants of the trajectory of
extreme quantiles of post-BD large and small airway metrics. Aim 3: Identify and evaluate vulnerable
subgroups who show heterogeneous susceptibilities to WTC exposures. Upon its completion, the proposed
project will expand our knowledge about health effects on severe respiratory diseases related to the 9/11
terrorist attacks, help to answer complex interplays of physical and mental health comorbidities, and apply
lessons to the management of disaster events."

Intestinal injury and inflammation in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), an increasing cause of morbidity,
mortality and financial cost in the US, is mediated by two large clostridial toxins: TcdA & TcdB. Although
antibodies against each toxin have been shown to be associated with protection, it is unclear what types of
antibodies and their epitopes are responsible for effective immunity against CDI in patients. The goal of this
project is to define the characteristics of a protective humoral immune response in CDI and the major
neutralizing TcdA & TcdB epitopes. The hypothesis is that host antibodies directed against major neutralizing
epitopes in TcdA & TcdB confer protection against CDI. To test this hypothesis, we will first validate our
preliminary finding on neutralizing anti-TcdA/TcdB responses that correlate protection against severe CDI will
also correlate protection against recurrence (Aim 1); subsequently we will characterize C. difficile toxin-specific
B cell responses at clonal level and correlate these with CDI disease progression and recurrence (Aim 2); and
finally we will clone neutralizing antibodies from individual B cells to obtain a representative panel of human
protective monoclonal antibodies against the two toxins and characterize their binding epitopes and reactivity
to a variety of toxins produced by major C. difficile endemic and outbreak strains (Aim 3). The completion of
these specific aims can lead to the discovery of antibody biomarkers that predict outcomes of the most
significant clinical issues in CDI management, including CDI occurrence, severity, and recurrence.
Identification and characterization of protective antibodies may also facilitate the development of novel passive
immunotherapy and vaccine approaches."
10876926,"Project Summary
One in five undergraduate women experience sexual assault (SA) during their college career, most commonly
under the influence of acute alcohol intoxication. One critical mechanism through which intoxication increases
risk for SA is a reduced ability to perceive SA risk cues due, in part, to the diminished attentional capacity that
occurs during intoxication. While laboratory studies have consistently observed greater reductions in SA risk
perception among intoxicated versus non-intoxicated women, the potential influence of state emotion on SA
risk perception during acute alcohol intoxication remains unexplored. This is a critical gap given theoretical
evidence to suggest that SA risk perception may be influenced by both negative and positive state emotions.
Accordingly, the proposed study will assess the roles of negative and positive emotion states and acute alcohol
intoxication on SA risk perception (Aim 1) as well as identify subjective (e.g., self-report) and objective (e.g.,
electrodermal response [EDA], heart rate variability [HRV]) indices of emotion states that underlie changes in
SA risk perception during acute alcohol intoxication (Aim 2). In a single experimental session, participants (i.e.,
undergraduate women aged 21 and older who use alcohol) will be randomly assigned to one of two alcohol
conditions (i.e., alcohol or no-alcohol) and one of three idiographic emotion induction conditions (i.e., positive,
negative, or neutral) prior to completing a SA risk perception task. Participants assigned to the acute alcohol
intoxication condition will be administered alcohol to achieve a target BAC of .08 (i.e., a dose of alcohol
equivalent to approximately four standard alcohol drinks). Positive, negative, or neutral emotion state will be
achieved using a validated idiographic emotion induction task. SA risk perception will be measured using a
hypothetical SA vignette designed to assess instances of discomfort and decision of when to leave the
hypothetical scenario. Subjective intensity and regulation of state emotion will be assessed via self-report
measures administered pre- and post- emotion induction as well as post-SA risk perception task. EDA and
HRV will capture objective arousal and regulation of state emotion, respectively, and will be measured
continuously during the experimental session with the BIOPAC MP36. This study is the first to utilize a
laboratory-based, multi-method approach to explicate the roles of state emotion and acute alcohol intoxication
on SA risk perception. In alignment with the NIAAA strategic plan, findings will help develop and improve
strategies to reduce and prevent alcohol-related harm, such as SA among undergraduate women. Additionally,
the proposed project would provide the Applicant with training that will inform her future research on the
intersection of SA and alcohol, including via the development of skills necessary for conducting sophisticated
experimental paradigms relevant to the study of state emotions (e.g., use of biomarkers), acute effects of
alcohol (e.g., alcohol administration), and SA risk perception (e.g., vignette methodology).

10884287,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most hospitals in Low Middle-Income countries (LMICS) do not practice the discharge planning models
shown in high-income settings (HICS) to avert adverse outcomes posthospitalization. In the absence of
such integrated programs and an increment in the double burden of disease of HIV and NCDs, the
mortality in people living with HIV(PWH) continues to be high post-hospitalization. The long-term goal is
to improve discharge practices and linkage to care for PWH and NCDS and achieve dual control of both
conditions. The objective of this R21 application is to adapt the Transitional care Mode based in HICS
(TCM) for targeted use as a post-discharge intervention for adults hospitalized with comorbid HIV and
NCDs in Malawi and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention in preparation
for a larger implementation science evaluation. The rationale for the project, is that there is a high
mortality post-hospitalization for PWH and NCDS, in part because of the lack of integrated discharge-
related interventions to support care post-hospitalization. TCM is an evidence-based model in the U.S.
adopted into clinical practice for diverse patient populations and demonstrated effectiveness in
improving patient outcomes after discharge. This model can be useful if adapted to the context and
resources available in LMICS, and feasibility tested for long-term adoption in the care of PWH and NCDs.
This research study will explore three specific aims: 1. Adapt the TCM for PWH hospitalized with NCDs
in Malawi. 2. Pilot test the adapted TCM with PWH admitted with NCDs. 3. Evaluate the feasibility,
effectiveness and acceptability of the adapted intervention. For the first aim, through in-depth
interviews (IDI) and focus groups discussions (FGDs) with HIV/NCD stakeholders, hospital staff, patients,
and caregivers, we will develop the SOPs for an adapted TCM. For the second aim, we will enroll 62
consecutive adults hospitalized with HIV and known with at least one common HIV- cardiometabolic
comorbidity (hypertensive urgency, heart failure, or diabetes,) and provide the adapted TCM. For the
third aim, using mixed methods, FGDs and IDI to hospital staff and patient/caregivers who participated
in TCM, we will evaluate the feasibility of providing TCM for a larger study. We will describe 3-month
post-discharge outcomes including re-admission, linkages and retention in care, mortality, and dual
control of HIV and NCDs. Comparison with a historical control group recruited just prior to the pilot
phase will provide preliminary data in regard to potential effects on readmission and death. This project
is innovative in that it will adapt a known model of transitional care from HICS to LMICS for PWH/NCDS
using existing resources to avert adverse outcomes. It will reinforce integrated linkages to care for both
HIV/NCDs. The proposed research is significant because it represents a new effort to bridge the gap
between inpatient and community-based care and integrate the care of HIV/NCDs posthospitalization."
10753438,"Project title: Molecular mechanism of piRNA biogenesis
Project summary
 Non-coding RNAs have diverse functions in eukaryotic cells. Use of these non-coding RNAs in
therapeutic approaches is a promising but rather unexplored direction in biomedical research. We discovered a
new class of small non-coding RNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), that together with their protein partners,
Piwi proteins, recognize and silence endogenous genomic parasites called transposable elements and are
involved in regulation of host gene expression. The silencing of transposons is critical in germline cells and the
failure of piRNA-mediated repression leads to sterility in both Drosophila and mice. The mechanism of
biogenesis of piRNAs appears to be distinct from that of other classes of small non-coding RNAs, microRNA
and siRNA. piRNAs are encoded in distinct genomic regions dubbed piRNA clusters that produce long ncRNA
transcripts, pre-piRNAs, that are further processed to mature piRNAs, which work as guides to recognize and
repress RNA targets. In germ cells of Drosophila, dual-strand piRNA clusters are bound by the Rhi-Del-Cuff
(RDC) chromatin complex, which is essential for non-canonical transcription of piRNA precursors and acts as a
master regulator of piRNA cluster identity. However, how RDC is recruited to the genome to specify regions for
piRNA production remains unknown. Our results suggest that piRNAs that are deposited to the egg by the
mother guide recruitment of RDC to mark piRNA-generating loci during embryogenesis, and this mark is
maintained during later development. After export from the nucleus, piRNA precursors are further processed
and loaded into piwi proteins in a cytoplasmic membraneless organelle called nuage. We identified the scaffold
protein of nuage and found that a posttranslational modification, symmetric methylation of arginine, of the
cytoplasmic piwi proteins plays an important role in both piRNA biogenesis and nuage assembly. We will
capitalize on our findings to understand critical steps of piRNA biogenesis in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
We will attack the problem of cluster specification by studying de novo establishment of piRNA clusters and
molecular mechanisms of RDC recruitment and maintenance, and study nuage formation and the role that this
compartmentalization plays in piRNA biogenesis. Our studies will help to advance our understanding of the
mechanism of transposon silencing, which is important for both fertility and for genomic stability. It will also
provide the basis for future use of the piRNA pathway as a tool in research and therapy. Importantly, the
significance of the proposed research extends well beyond answering important questions in the non-coding
RNA field. Our studies will provide clues to the problems of specification of distinct chromatin domains,
decoding of the histone code and formation and function of membraneless cellular compartments. As such, our
work will explore fundamental mechanisms that control chromatin organization and cellular
compartmentalization."

Ting Therapeutics LLC is a pharmaceutical company developing drugs to prevent and treat hearing loss.
Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs to treat cancers. However cisplatin anticancer therapy causes
high frequency hearing loss in 40-60% of the patients. To date, no drugs have been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for protection from cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Most candidate compounds currently in
pre-clinical and clinical trials are related to antioxidants, vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, and thus many of
these compounds, such as sodium thiosulfate, can interfere with cisplatin’s ability to kill the tumor cells. We
recently conducted unbiased high-throughput screens of bioactive compounds in a cochlear ear cell line and
identified cyclin dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) inhibitors as important therapeutic compounds for cisplatin-induced
cell death and hearing loss. Among those compounds, TT001 was the most potent CDK2 inhibitor tested. Results
from our SBIR Phase I, demonstrated that oral TT001 ameliorated cisplatin-induced hearing loss with no general
toxicity. Moreover, TT001 did not interfere with cisplatin anti-cancer activity in vitro. In this SBIR Phase II, we will
perform Investigational New Drug-enabling experiments to test TT001’s effect on cisplatin’s tumor killing efficacy
in vivo and to conduct efficacy studies to define an optimal dosing regimen and therapeutic index. The long-term
goal is for TT001 to become a standard otoprotective drug of cisplatin-based therapies. For this purpose, we will
demonstrate TT001’s efficacy in a mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity that mimics the administration protocol in
cancer patients (Aim1). We will determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles in blood and
perilymph, as well as efficacy, in a guinea pig model for cisplatin-induced hearing loss (Aim 2). This Aim will be
performed under contract with and independent and reputable Contract Research Organization, Turner Scientific
LLC. Finally, we will verify that TT001 does not interfere with cisplatin’s anti-cancer activity in vivo in mouse
model xenografts (Aim 3). By successfully completing these studies, Ting Therapeutics will obtain critical data
necessary for the initiation of Investigational New Drug-enabling Good Laboratory Practice complaint studies
and clinical trials. Ting Therapeutics LLC has the exclusive international rights for the use of CDK2 inhibitors in
the treatment of hearing loss. The company has filed for international patents in Japan, Europe, China and Hong
Kong. The patent in Europe and China has been awarded; similar patent applications are pending in US, Japan
(No 2020-156803), and Hong Kong. Ting Therapeutics is negotiating with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
for the US Method of Use patent rights on CDK2 inhibitors for hearing loss (US Patent Application No.
62/181,755; PCT/US16/38384; WO 2016/205806). The completion of this proposal will allow Ting Therapeutics
to initiate conversations with pharmaceutical companies for the manufacturing and licensing of TT001."
10753440,"Organisms living on Earth cope daily with changes in their environment. An endogenous oscillator, known
as the circadian clock, enables organisms to coordinate metabolism, physiology, and development in
 anticipation of diurnal and seasonal environmental changes and therefore, enhances fitness. The
molecular network underlying the circadian system relies on interlocked transcriptional-translational
feedback loops, in addition to multiple layers of regulation at the cellular and organismal level. We
 propose to deploy a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical, physiological, bioinformatic, and
genome-wide approaches to identify new components of the clockwork, and unravel the intricate wiring of
the circadian clock in Arabidopsis.
TOC1 is a key element of the core-clock of Arabidopsis. Recent data from our laboratory have shown that
TOC1 binds to RNA in vitro. We propose to validate this biochemical property in vivo and study its
biological relevance. We will also characterize TOC1 association with the transcriptional machinery and
 with hub components of hormone signaling pathways, which will be instrumental to understand the role of
TOC1 in the circadian system. We further seek to explore the GI molecular network and propose to
combine molecular, genetic, and biochemical analyses to study novel partners including transcription
factors associated with pathogen responses, hormone and growth signaling. Preliminary data from our
 laboratory also suggest a potential role of the circadian clock in nitrate uptake. We aim to characterize
nitrate uptake dynamics and by utilizing genetic, biochemical, and physiological studies we seek to
 identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the potential regulation of root physiology by the
endogenous clock.
 By integrating different approaches including bioinformatic, classic plant photobiology tools and mutant
screens, we propose to elucidate three distinct layers of the clock: to uncover the signaling pathway of
light input to the clockwork; to identify new core-clock elements; and to discover components that are
 necessary for the oscillator to achieve different developmental or physiological traits.
 Mechanistic details from our study can be extrapolated outside the circadian field to advance research of
 other complex regulatory systems and ultimately impact work in human health, disease, and food security.

RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 This proposal will improve our insights of plant physiology and will provide a comprehensive
 understanding of the circadian system and the cellular processes associated with it. The study will
 ultimately impact research in human biological rhythms and treatment of circadian-linked health disorders."
10754524,"Nociception is the process whereby a subset of somatosensory nerve fibers (called nociceptors) detect noxious stimuli and transmit this information to the spinal cord and brain, ultimately producing a percept of discomfort or pain. Nociceptors are faced with the complex task of detecting disparate environmental and endogenous signals of both a physical and chemical nature; these include temperature, pressure, irritants, pruritogens, and inflammatory agents. Consequently, nociceptor activation elicits acute pain as well as injury-evoked pain hypersensitivity and can contribute to so-called ‘maladaptive’ processes underlying persistent pain syndromes. Our goal is to understand how nociceptors detect and integrate these signals in response to changing environmental or physiological conditions. Natural products from plants or venomous creatures have served as tremendously valuable tools for deciphering cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to nociception and pain. Notable examples include the use of natural analgesics, such as morphine (from the opium poppy) and salicylate (from willow bark) to discover opioid receptors and cyclooxgenases, respectively. Other important examples include the use of natural irritants, such as capsaicin (from chili peppers) and menthol (from mint leaves) to identify ion channels that detect heat and cold, respectively. Indeed, each of these natural product receptors represents a validated or potential target for pharmacological management of acute or chronic pain. This proposal is aimed at elucidating molecules, cells, and mechanisms that contribute to nociception in the context of acute (protective) or pathological (chronic) pain states. We shall continue to exploit the vast chemical ‘space’ of natural product pharmacology to identify and characterize ion channels and sensory neuron subtypes that contribute to distinct nociceptive modalities. At the most reductionist level, we will use biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological tools to elucidate structural mechanisms underlying ion channel function, including stimulus detection, drug binding, and gating. Here, the main emphasis will be on members of the TRP channel family that are targeted by natural pungent agents and play major roles in thermo- or chemo-nociception. At a more integrative level, we will use molecular and pharmacological probes to characterize distinct nociceptor subtypes, whose functionalities will be examined in mice using genetic, anatomical, and in vivo imaging methods. As one such example, we are interested in characterizing a population of presumptive Aδ nociceptors and asking how they contribute to mechanical pain. Together, these studies will provide important mechanistic insights for the development of novel analgesic therapies."
10754525,"ABSTRACT
The catalytic activity and specificity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) is
governed through their ability to interact with the MAPKs. The MKPs set the fidelity and kinetics of MAPK
signaling by regulating, in a spatially distinct manner, both the magnitude and duration of MAPK activity.
However, these regulatory mechanisms alone are insufficient to explain the complexity of MKP/MAPK-
mediated signaling. This is exemplified by the observation that inactivation of MKPs deliver unique, and in
some cases, non-obvious physiological and pathophysiological outcomes that has led to the realization that
MKPs represent valuable therapeutic targets for the treatment of certain diseases. We have found that MKP5,
which directly dephosphorylates p38 MAPK and JNK, is involved in the development of cardiac fibrosis, a
serious sequalae that precedes heart failure. Mice lacking MKP5 are protected from the development of
cardiac fibrosis and heart failure in a model of pressure overload. A high throughput small molecule screen
identified a first-in-class inhibitor of MKP5. Resolution of the co-crystal structure of the inhibitor in complex with
MKP5 revealed that the inhibitor bound to an allosteric site on MKP5. We hypothesize that the MKP5 allosteric
site represents an additional mode of MKP5 regulation that governs signaling specificity and that this allosteric
site represents the “Achilles heel” of MKP5 for small molecule targeting. The broad goal of this work is two-fold.
First, we will define the molecular basis for how the allosteric site regulates MKP5 catalysis and MAPK
signaling. Second, whether disruption of the allosteric site produces outcomes in a disease context that provide
proof-of-concept that if successfully “drugged” this site represents a platform for development of first-in-class
MKP inhibitors. We will execute the specifics of these two broad goals through three specific aims. Aim 1, will
employ structural biology and biophysical approaches to elucidate the structural determinants and binding
mechanisms conferred by the MKP5 allosteric site to determine how this site regulates MKP5 catalysis and
MAPK binding. A co-complex between MKP5 and p38 MAPK will be obtained to define how p38 MAPK
modulates MKP5 through the allosteric site. In Aim 2, the effects of mutants in the MKP5 allosteric site on
MAPK signaling will be determined by generating knockin cells harboring MKP5 allosteric site mutants using
CRISPR-Cas approaches. The specificity of the MKP5 allosteric site to “fine-tune” MAPK-mediated signaling
will be determined using non-biased phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic approaches. In Aim 3, the effects of
targeting the MKP5 allosteric site in cardiac fibrosis and heart failure will be determined through the generation
of a novel MKP5 allosteric site mutant knock-in mouse. These studies will define a new mode of operation for
MKP5 that will provide information on the actions of the allosteric site at the atomic level. How the MKP5
allosteric site impacts physiological signaling and the validity of the allosteric site as a “druggable” target in
disease therapeutics will be defined."
10754526,"Remodeling of cortical networks by visual experience during development relies on rapid changes in synaptic
structure and function. The exquisite specificity of these activity-driven synaptic changes begs the question of
how they are implemented. Surprisingly we have recently shown that microglia, the brain’s immune cells, are
critical in this process. However, only a handful of the microglial mechanisms that contribute to plasticity have
been described. These pathways were initially studied for their roles in neuroinflammatory responses and it is
becoming clear that such mechanisms are also used in microglial function in the healthy brain. Norepinephrine
signaling through microglial adrenergic receptors is known to affect microglial function in pathological settings
but microglial contributions to norepinephrine’s effects on plasticity are as yet unstudied. Adrenergic signaling is
a particularly intriguing candidate as it directly opposes the purinergic signaling pathway in microglia that we
showed to be critical for plasticity, suggesting that adrenergic signaling in microglia could also impact synaptic
remodeling. Additionally, adrenergic signaling modulates global state changes between sleep and wakefulness,
and we have recently discovered that arousal changes microglial dynamics, which are critical to microglia-
synapse interactions. Therefore, in this proposal we will test the hypothesis that norepinpehrine acting through
microglial adrenergic receptors alters microglial function thereby affecting plasticity. To rigorously
investigate how norepinephrine affects physiological microglia, we will first examine how adrenergic signaling
affects microglial dynamics, surveillance and injury response in vivo (Aim1). We will then examine how
adrenergic signaling in microglia affects activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex (Aim 2) and the
associated functions of microglia during plasticity (Aim 3). We will use pharmacological approaches to alter
adrenergic signaling while monitoring microglia and visual responses, and we will determine whether effects are
specific to adrenergic signaling in microglia using conditional microglia-specific knock-out of the beta 2
adrenergic receptor (β2 AR) which is expressed at high levels within microglia. These studies will provide
important insight into the molecular mechanisms used by microglia when interacting with synapses which is
critical for understanding how microglia contribute to synaptic plasticity. Because synaptic plasticity is affected
in a large number of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders, many of which are also associated with
aberrant adrenergic signaling, our work will provide potential targets for intervention to reinstate appropriate
plastic changes and ameliorate symptoms in these diseases."
10754528,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Actomyosin-based force generation sculpts tissues into a remarkable array of shapes during
development. Successful tissue sculpting requires that actomyosin is precisely regulated and that the
resulting force patterns are transmitted across the tissue. Force transmission itself affects contractile
signaling, resulting in emergent behaviors that result in tissue shape change.
 We have demonstrated the role of dynamic RhoA-GTPase cycling in generating actomyosin
pulses and waves in Drosophila gastrulation and oogenesis, respectively. In each of these cases, we
identified a Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) that is required for cycling behavior and
demonstrates the functional importance for the cycling in morphogenesis. Our work has demonstrated
the requirement of RhoGTPase cycling in tissue invagination and the completion of cytoplasmic
transport from germline support cells to the oocyte. The mechanisms that initiate these dynamic
behaviors and how they are influenced by force transmission in a tissue are still unknown.
 Patterns of force transmission in a tissue are complex and extremely dynamic. We have
identified the importance of supracellular actomyosin meshworks in transmitting forces between
hundreds of cells in a tissue, which forms chains of mechanically interconnected cells. Supracellular
actomyosin meshworks within epithelia can exhibit biased connections, which influence tissue
mechanics. But, how a cell determines which neighbors to link to is unknown and critical to understand
tissue shape. Furthermore, the cell biological mechanisms that dissipate forces in response to
morphogenetic movements and how they are coordinated with movement are poorly understood.
 We will undertake a multidisciplinary and multiscale approach to understand tissue shape
emergence. Combining our ability to visualize and perturb dynamic signaling pathways we will
investigate the interconnection between forces `felt' by cells and resulting single cell signaling patterns
with the goal of bridging molecular and tissue scales. Members of my lab include biologists, physicists,
and engineers. In addition, we have excellent collaborators in Mathematics to supplement our research
capabilities. We are poised to make additional important contributions to our understanding of how
collective cell behaviors contribute to morphogenesis."
10755357,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
While several studies have identified deficits in decision-making abilities in old age, many of these studies
focus specifically on reinforcement learning and its associated reward networks. Reinforcement learning theory
states that our choices are shaped by expectations based on a running average of our experiences, but this
may provide an overly simplistic view. Recent work has shown that decision-making at time of choice depends
not only on the average of past experiences, but also on memories of specific individual experiences and their
associated contexts (e.g., the time and place in which they were experienced). This context-guided memory
sampling (CGMS) model of decision-making, developed by the sponsor, asserts that choice behavior is
influenced by memory content that is retrieved when making a decision, in addition to traditional reinforcement
learning (e.g., the influence of recent rewards). We propose that age-related deficits in memory, therefore, may
play a significant role in influencing choice behavior in older adults. Given the well-characterized age-related
deficits in memory research, particularly in the areas of associative and episodic memory, this project
addresses to what extent memory processes influence decision-making, and whether age-related deficits in
decision-making are due to the well-documented age-related impairments observed in memory. Across 3
experiments, we utilize a neuro-computational approach to examine how memory processes and
reinforcement learning contribute to decision-making across the lifespan. In doing so, we aim to precisely
identify the mechanisms associated with decision failures in aging. In Aim 1, we manipulate memory demands
and learning content to assess how individual differences in memory ability influence decision-making
strategies. In Aim 2, we will use computational modeling to identify how age-related differences in episodic
memory and reinforcement learning influence subsequent choice behaviors in older vs. younger adult
populations. In Aim 3, we will use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the
specific neural computations and networks that support and explain choice behavior in older adults on a trial-
by-trial basis. Findings from these proposed studies can help develop training interventions that promote
healthy aging and target learning interventions to support early detection and treatment of age-related
cognitive dysfunctions in older adult populations. This research is relevant to the older adult population at
large, but also to patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias who experience profound deficits in
learning, memory, and decision-making."
10755366,"Project Summary/Abstract
HIV/AIDS is a chronic infectious disease that affects around 37 million people worldwide. CD8 T cells play a
critical role in controlling HIV infection. However, CD8 T cells become exhausted over time due to continuous
stimulation. Exhausted HIV-specific CD8 T cells, characterized by elevated expression of inhibitory receptors
(e.g. PD-1), positively correlate with higher viral load, impaired T cell function, and disease progression. In HIV
and other chronic viral infections, exhausted antigen-specific CD8 T cells expressing PD-1 can create a
suppressive environment suggesting that such cells not only have a direct role in disease progression but can
cross-talk with other immune cells to impair their function. Chronic HIV infection dysregulates T cell energy
metabolism. HIV-specific CD8 T cells isolated from infected individuals exhibit elevated mitochondrial stress
which is still apparent years after antiretroviral therapy (ART). PD-1 expression on T cells is associated with
mitochondrial stress. PD-1-mediated signaling dysregulates T cell mitochondrial energetics by reducing
glycolysis and shifting towards fatty acid b-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Metformin is an
FDA-approved drug that dampens OxPhos by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I. To date, most studies
investigating metformin use in HIV+ individuals are often in the presence of ART. It has yet to be explored how
modulating energy metabolism with metformin impacts host immunity in an ART-naïve setting. HIV not only
impairs immune control of the viral infection, but also increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections. People
living with HIV are incredibly susceptible to the tuberculosis-causing bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).
We previously showed SIV-infected Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) to be more susceptible to Mtb,
which we attributed to immunologic impairment by preexisting SIV infection. Therefore, Mtb challenge is a
stringent assessment of host defenses and, given the prevalence of HIV/Mtb co-infection, has great relevance
to global health.
In this K01 proposal, we will identify pathways involved in energy metabolism in CD8 T cells during chronic HIV
infection and reveal their role in T cell exhaustion using our established MCM model of HIV. We will use a
comprehensive analytic approach that combines single cell RNA sequencing, metabolic assays, and flow
cytometry to assess the role of T cell metabolism in SIV-infected MCM. We will alter metabolism using metformin
to reprogram CD8 T cells and determine whether this metabolic reprogramming improves host immunity by
challenging SIV+ animals with Mtb."
10846814,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal inflammatory disease that primarily affects
premature infants and extremely low birth weight babies. Commonly observed risk factors for NEC are
prematurity, formula feeding, intestinal dysbiosis, and infection. Previous studies strongly suggest a critical role
of the inappropriate microbiome colonization and activation neonatal immune system in NEC development.
However, the pathogenesis of NEC is elusive. Particularly, it remains unclear how the NEC-associated risk
factors contribute to the disorder. In preliminary studies, we characterized the effect of formula-feeding on
intestinal flora, gene expression, and immunobiology in neonatal mice. We also examined intestinal pathology
of mouse pups which were fed with formula followed by induction of a particular antimicrobial immune response.
We found that formula-feeding alone resulted in a distinct type of gut dysbiosis and pre-NEC intestinal molecular
changes that predispose the neonatal gut to inappropriate microbiome colonization/infection and render intestinal
mucosa to be a target of cytotoxic inflammatory cells. We further revealed that formula-fed but not dam-fed
mouse pups developed NEC upon activation of a cytotoxic inflammatory cell-associated antimicrobial immune
response. Thus, it appears that NEC develops following inappropriate microbiome colonization in premature
infants as a consequence of “multi-hit pathophysiological events”. In this project, we will study new mechanistic
insights into these events and determine how the interaction of multiple-hit events contributes to the development
of NEC in two complementary aims: (1) We will first characterize the series of pathophysiological events that
leads to NEC development, using a novel and pathologically relevant mouse pup model of NEC and up-to-dated
in vivo experimental pathological and immunological approaches. Then, we will use RNAseq and cutting-edge
bioinformatic analysis to delineate the transcriptomic response of the small intestine of mouse pups to multiple-
hit challenges and to unravel the relevance of this novel mouse model of NEC for human NEC. Furthermore, we
will study how major NEC risk factor-induced “multi-hit events” contribute to NEC development by focusing on
inflammatory cells, mucosal inflammation-associated inflammatory mediators, and a unique signal axis that
protects intestinal epithelial cells against inflammatory cell attack. We will achieve this aim using in vivo
experimental approaches that draw on molecular biology and mouse genetic engineering techniques. (2) We will
elucidate how formula feeding causes pre-NEC molecular changes in the small intestine of premature neonates
by taking a multidisciplinary in vivo and in vitro approaches that incorporate techniques of organoid culture,
molecular and cellular biology, microbiology, mouse genetic engineering and gnotobiogy. Together, our work will
provide a novel mouse model relevant for human NEC, advance knowledge of how the interaction between NEC
risk factors and activation of the neonatal immature immune system triggers NEC development, and gain
mechanistic insights that will inform the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of NEC."
10764210,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a highly prevalent condition characterized by progressive cardiac
dysfunction and interstitial cardiac fibrosis that leads to congestive heart failure (HF) and premature death. As
HF progresses, some individuals will develop cardiac cachexia, which limits quality of life, reduces functional
capacity, and confers an increased risk of death. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms that underlie cardiac
cachexia are completely unknown. This knowledge gap prevents adequate treatment for a complication that may
affect as many as 1,000,000 Americans. Delineating the molecular pathways driving cachexia would likely yield
clinically actionable evidence that could impact HF care. The present proposal will address this knowledge gap.
Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a pleiotropic cytokine that can be produced by most organs
secondary to a variety of stressors. GDF15 is an exquisitely sensitive biomarker that predicts new-onset
cardiovascular events and death in healthy individuals and is highly prognostic in individuals with a wide range
of chronic diseases, including HF. Despite this, the biologic function of GDF15 in the heart and in those with HF
remains unknown. Recent evidence from animal models and the cancer literature has revealed that GDF15 acts
via a very specific receptor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor α-like (GFRAL), that is only expressed
in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem. In this context, GDF15 suppresses food
intake, thus modulating systemic metabolism and reducing food intake. Under stress conditions (i.e., toxin
ingestion, as with chemotherapy), this produces an aversive/anorexic response. But, when left unchecked (as
when chronically overexpressed}, GDF15 triggers a catabolic-anabolic imbalance that results in cachexia.
Evidence also suggests that GDF15 acts in a GFRAL-independent fashion via as-yet undiscovered mechanisms
to elicit other responses including immunomodulation, suppression of fibrosis and altered cell cycling.
Review of large transcriptomic datasets in the NCBl's GEO repository, including the Pl's earlier transcriptomic
work in a genetic model of DCM, reveals that Gdf15 is substantially upregulated in a wide variety of HF models.
This exploratory proposal will use genetic mouse models of GDF15 and GFRAL knock-out to study the role of
the GDF15-GFRAL axis in cardiac cachexia and in DCM progression. Through detailed phenotyping, basic
molecular methods, RNA sequencing and a small clinical pilot study in advanced HF patients, this proposal will
lay the foundation for future research on the role of GDF15 in HF and cardiac cachexia. Our proposal is highly
innovative and uses robust, unbiased methods to address important questions of great significance to the NHLBI.
Our collaborative group brings synergistic expertise on cardiovascular disease models, body composition
analysis, clinical research, and next-generation sequencing that will enhance the execution of this proposal.
Ultimately, we expect our results will inform new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HF, thus targeting a
tremendous unmet need in clinical cardiology."

Integrated quality control (QC) systems are required to sense and manage mitochondrial stress, and their
dysregulation is associated with neurodegenerative disease, aging, and cancer. The human ATP-dependent
AAA+ protease, LONP1, has emerged as a master regulator of mitochondrial functions and is an integral
component of mitochondrial QC systems. Deletion of LONP1 in mice is embryonically lethal and altered LONP1
activity is associated with mitochondrial diseases, aging, and cancer. LONP1 classically functions by degrading
oxidatively damaged and unfolded matrix proteins, but also regulates diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology
by specifically targeting and degrading folded proteolytic targets such as transcription factor A (TFAM) and
cytochrome C oxidase subunit IV (COXIV). Additionally, LONP1 is a single stranded DNA binding protein that
localizes to the non-coding control region of mitochondrial DNA, which is important for transcription and genome
replication. LONP1 assembles as a 600 kDa hexamer composed of an N-terminal substrate binding domain
(NTD), a AAA+ ATPase domain, and a C-terminal protease domain and can function as a protease, a chaperone,
or a DNA binding protein. Despite these diverse critical functions, we lack detailed molecular mechanisms
describing these activities and their regulation, limiting the fields capacity to determine their specific roles in
mitochondrial homeostasis or disease pathogenesis. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have
provided crucial insights into LONP1's conserved, AAA+-mediated hand-over-hand substrate translocation
mechanism required to processively engage, unfold, and degrade proteolytic substrates. Strikingly, in these
structures, the C-terminal protease domains remain in an inactive conformation even with substrate bound to
LONP1's AAA+ domain. These findings contrast recent work on the evolutionarily related bacterial Lon protease
and suggest that LONP1 has evolved additional levels of regulation to control or tune proteolytic activity to meet
cellular needs. Moreover, these results raise important questions regarding proteolytic regulation and its
relationship to other reported cellular functions, including DNA binding. Therefore, the long-term goal of this
proposal will be to establish mechanistic models for LONP1's manifold functions and their allosteric regulation
in order to define their role in mitochondrial maintenance and disease. I hypothesize that LONP1 adopts distinct
structural conformations allosterically regulated by nucleotide state, substrate binding, and/or posttranslational
modifications to shift between operational modes to modulate proteolytic and mtDNA binding activities. I will
integrate structural studies using cryo-EM with biochemical assays to identify allosteric mechanisms involved in
regulating LONP1's proteolytic activity (Aim 1) and elucidate the molecular mechanism and conformational state
required for LONP1's mtDNA binding activity (Aim 2)."

Arousal and Regulatory domain of RDoC, is a critical process supporting psychiatric health during
adolescence. Specifically, sleep disturbances appear to represent a transdiagnostic risk factor for onset of
internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as interfere with academic and social performance during this
critical developmental period. Thus, preventative interventions to improve sleep among adolescents are
necessary to support psychiatric health and functioning across the lifespan. Efficacious behavioral sleep
strategies exist for adolescents. However, there has been limited translation of what is known to work in
research and subspecialty care settings to community preventive and primary care practice settings, where
most adolescents access social and health services. As well, much of the anticipatory guidance in primary care
focuses on sleep duration, which may be difficult to improve upon for adolescents navigating multiple academic
and extracurricular demands. In contrast, another critical aspect of sleep, the regularity of sleep-wake patterns,
is associated with a range of psychiatric health and functional outcomes, and these relationships are shown to
be independent of duration, suggesting enhancing sleep regularity may improve adolescent psychiatric
outcomes even if duration remains constant. Recognizing the powerful connections between sleep, psychiatric
wellness, and psychosocial function, there is a critical need to take efficacious behavioral strategies to improve
sleep regularity among youth, and to optimize the delivery system to reach diverse youth in the primary care
setting, the point of access for most youth seeking support for emotional and mental health. For the proposed
project, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week digital sleep regularity intervention
(Sustainable Habits for Encouraging Even Teen Sleep; SHEETS) among a diverse population of adolescents,
ages 13-15 years, and will explore a range of socio-environmental drivers of sleep regularity as they relate to
intervention uptake. SHEETS uses a digital platform to deliver education on sleep regularity as a health
prevention tool, motivational messaging, support for setting goals for consistent bed- and wake-times, and self-
monitoring. Wearable sleep sensors (Garmin wristwatches) provide real-time feedback to adolescents about
their sleep regularity. We will also evaluate the short-term effectiveness of SHEETS on sleep regularity, sleep
practices, and psychiatric health (i.e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms, psychosocial function) among
adolescents receiving health services in a primary care pediatric practice compared to an active control group,
and will explore sleep regularity as a mediator of the relationship between SHEETS participation and better
psychiatric health. Findings from this study will inform proposal development for an adequately-powered
randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to optimize and evaluate scalable, easily disseminated digital sleep
interventions that are acceptable and effective for youth living in a range of sociocultural contexts."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills approximately 1.4 million people annually. People
exposed to similar initial doses may have very different outcomes, ranging from clearance
to active disease to subclinical or latent infection. A central structure of tuberculosis, the
granuloma represents a key interface between pathogen and host, and its dynamics
contribute to disease outcome. Granuloma macrophages induce expression of an unusual
epithelioid program that dictates granuloma structure and infection trajectory. Due to a
lack of genetically tractable animal models that fully reproduce key aspects of granuloma
biology – namely, epithelioid transformation and necrosis – many aspects of granuloma
formation have not been probed. Genome-wide association studies in humans have
identified several potential TB susceptibility loci, but the mechanisms by which these
genes act, particularly within the granuloma, are not well understood. Here we will link
established human genetic susceptibility loci to the biology of mycobacterial granulomas.
We will use murine, zebrafish, and explant models of bona fide mycobacterial granulomas
to directly probe granuloma structure, epithelioid state, immune and drug access and
granuloma dynamics. Using single cell transcriptional profiling and host and bacterial
mutants, we have defined a repertoire of diverse cell types and transcriptional states that
contribute to the physiological properties of the mycobacterial granuloma. We will define
how alteration of host immune pathways identified in genome-wide human genetic studies
alter granuloma biology through murine and zebrafish models that recapitulate key
properties of human granulomas, including caseation necrosis and epithelioid
transformation. We will validate these findings in human TB granuloma specimens. Finally,
we will use comprehensive TnSeq profiling using saturating Mtb transposon libraries to
define the interplay between bacteria and host within the context of the tuberculous
granuloma. Overall, these approaches will lead to a fuller understanding of granuloma
biology as well as new opportunities for therapeutic interventions."

Hospital discharge is a high-risk time due to the frequency of miscommunication, medication errors, and
discontinuity of providers which lead to dangerous and costly hospital readmissions. Patients with limited
English proficiency (LEP)—a growing demographic in the United States—are the most likely to be negatively
impacted by these gaps in quality and safety given the communication barriers created by language discordant
care and their additional social vulnerabilities. Patients with LEP are more likely to have poor comprehension of
discharge instructions, face barriers to obtaining medications, report new or worsening symptoms once home,
and suffer post-discharge adverse events. Such inequities lead to poor outcomes, which drive health
disparities. While multiple care transition interventions have been shown to improve these outcomes,
they have excluded patients with LEP. ReEngineered Discharge (RED) is a multi-component discharge
intervention that was shown to reduce reutilization by 32% and improve patient experience. To improve health
equity in outcomes relating to hospital discharge, care transition programs such as RED must be adapted to
meet the needs of those with LEP, addressing language barriers, cultural factors, and social determinants of
health salient at the time of discharge. Adaptation is a proven strategy to reduce disparities by ensuring
intervention fit, and thus effectiveness, in health disparity populations. The goal of this application is to
adapt RED for patients with LEP, informed by new data on patient preferences and a multidisciplinary
adaptation process utilizing key stakeholders, and test it in a pilot trial. In Aim 1, I will conduct a discrete choice
experiment (DCE), a modified survey methodology to quantify preferences through implicit trade-offs in
choices, to understand how those with LEP value different discharge supports. In Aim 2, I will apply the ADAPT
methodology, an evidence-based approach that harnesses wisdom from a diverse team of stakeholders, to
determine the specific adaptations to RED. In Aim 3, I will test the adapted intervention (RED-LEP) in a
diverse safety net LEP population through a pilot randomized controlled trial with the goal to assess key
implementation outcomes (fidelity, acceptability, and feasibility) as well as the feasibility collecting data on
clinical outcomes. The proposed research will provide me with experience in the following domains, which
address specific deficits in my training in implementation science to date: quantitative approaches to
understanding stakeholder preference, intervention adaptation, and conduct of clinical trials with participants
with LEP. This research builds on my prior work with ethnic and linguistic minority populations in the global
setting and my clinical expertise as a hospitalist in a diverse safety net setting. My training aims—along with
my multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team with experience in health equity research, implementation science,
and linguistic barriers to care—will facilitate my transition to research independence and position me to test the
RED-LEP model in a multi-site hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial."

The use of opioids by pregnant women has increased in recent years, especially the abuse of fentanyl in the US.
Opioids increase the risk of pregnancy loss and stillbirth and can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome
(NOWS) in infants, leading to cognitive and behavioral risks in children and adults. However, the neural basis of
these deficits is not understood. Animal models suggest that behavioral and cognitive deficits from prenatal
opioid exposure are directly caused by persistent opioid exposure, but the cellular and molecular basis of these
deficits are largely unknown. The septal complex plays a critical role in addiction, drug-seeking, and stress
related behaviors, but it is unclear how specific septal neural cell types contribute to opioid-induced
neuroadaptations. It is also unknown if neurodevelopment is a sensitive period where drug-induced changes can
become permanent or what cell types and molecular programs are induced by opioid exposure and addictive
states in the developing and adult brain. Using scalable complementary cellular and molecular approaches our
study will characterize the developmental trajectories and adaptations of neural cell types in the septal complex
in a mouse model of early life opioid exposure and withdrawal to address these gaps in knowledge. Our studies
will provide a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular, circuit and molecular adaptations that occur in the
developing septal complex after fentanyl exposure and determine the key septal cell types that mediate circuit
and behavioral adaptations that occur with early life opioid exposure."

Norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) are neurotransmitters released by a small number of neurons in the
locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe (DR), respectively. Each group of neurons provides extensive
innervation of most of the brain. Although these groups of cells are often considered to be homogenous, recent
data indicates the existence of subclasses of each neuron. This proposal aims to generate multi-scale data on
each system, comprising molecular, genetic, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral experiments. Our team
is in a unique position to integrate across experiments and develop a new understanding of the subclasses of
LC-NE and DR-5-HT neurons and their functions during behavior.
 Three aims test specific questions about the cell types and functions of LC-NE and DR-5-HT neurons in
mice: 1) LC-NE neuron subclasses have distinct biophysical properties and axonal projections; 2) subclasses
of DR-5-HT neurons have distinct biophysical properties and axonal projections; and 3) subclasses of LC-NE
and DR-5-HT neurons have different functions during dynamic decision making. Our experiments will be used
to develop a comprehensive classification of NE and 5-HT neuronal subclasses and will be used to generate
reagents to target those cells."

 This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for
Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director
of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr.
Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his
basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings
and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a
long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training
Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.
 The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a
focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already
has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to
make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his
own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research
groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH-
funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close
collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain
network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01
MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe
and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for
the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.
 Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan
is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission
of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current
application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research
program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry
 Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career
investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD
and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded
patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience."
10757395,"Project Summary/Abstract
 There is increasing interest in using immunotherapy or targeted therapy to treat brain metastases,
including leptomeningeal disease from cancer. However, it can be challenging to interpret response to
treatment or to understand patterns of response or resistance to treatment since serial tissue samples are
difficult to obtain from the brain. Thus, there is a critical need to identify noninvasive makers of response or
resistance to new therapies being evaluated in this understudied patient population.
 In this proposal, Aim 1 will combine circulating tumor DNA with sophisticated MRI scans to improve our
ability to interpret response of brain metastases patients treated with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. With
pembrolizumab, increase in contrast enhancement on MRI can be tumor progression or inflammation from
successful re-activation of the immune system with treatment. We hypothesize that by combining a quantitative
measure of tumor burden, specifically circulating tumor DNA, with MRI scans, we will be able to disambiguate
true progression from pseudoprogression and, moreover, to understand mechanisms of response/resistance.
Aim 2 will use circulating tumor DNA to shed light on the clonal evolution of brain metastases in response to
targeted therapy, allowing for noninvasive means to understand response and resistance patterns. Aim 3 will
address the clinical challenge of accurately determining radiographic response in patients with leptomeningeal
disease from cancer. Similar to our hypothesis for parenchymal brain metastases, we expect that adding
ctDNA to MRI will improve our ability to more reliably measure LMD response to treatment."

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a fibrotic complication affecting the retina. In PVR, loss of visual
acuity, and in severe cases blindness, is caused by contraction of scar tissue that form on the retinal
surface. PVR is found in ~50% of posterior segment ocular trauma cases and about 5% of cases after
surgical repair of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Reliable treatment for PVR is currently unavailable,
and therefore, prevention is important. The overall goal of this project is to unravel molecular mechanisms
involved in PVR development to identify targets for potential intervention. The trigger for fibrosis such as
PVR is sustained presence of myofibroblasts, a cell type specialized ECM deposition and wound
contraction. Recent studies show that stiff ECM activates intracellular signaling essential for differentiation
of myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, in turn, feeds back to further enhances ECM stiffness via aberrant ECM
deposition and crosslinking. This positive feedback loop between myofibroblasts and ECM rigidity sustains
myofibroblast presence, and its inhibition successfully prevented lung and liver fibrosis in animal models.
However, the underlying detailed mechanisms and molecules involved are both tissue and cell type
dependent, and the role of this positive feedback loop is yet to be examine in PVR. Past studies show the
presence of molecules involved in ECM stiffening in samples from PVR patients. Our preliminary data show
two key molecules known to be affected by ECM stiffness, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)
channel and myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), are required for myofibroblast
transdifferentiation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and Müller glia cells, two resident cell types that give
rise to myofibroblasts in PVR. Further, data also show another molecule regulated by stiffness and known to
alter MRTF target expression, TAZ, interacts with MRTF. We propose studies to determine molecular
mechanisms activated by ECM stiffness leading to myofibroblast differentiation and PVR. In Aim1, the effect
of ECM stiffening molecules on myofibroblast differentiation and PVR will be examine. Detailed molecular
mechanism of regulating MRTF, which is key to myofibroblast differentiation, by TRPV4 and TAZ will be
determined in Aim2 and 3, respectively. The project has the potential to uncover key molecular therapeutic
targets for the prevention of PVR, and possibly other fibrotic diseases."

The WHO estimates there are approximately 5 million cases of influenza infections annually, with approximately
500,000 deaths occurring globally. The most cost-effective protection against influenza is vaccination.
Unfortunately, due to yearly antigenic shifts and drifts, current seasonal vaccines are ineffective. There is a need
for a better flu vaccine. In order to design a better flu vaccine, we plan on optimizing the immune synapse using
nano/microparticles (MPs) fabricated from the polymer acetalated dextran (Ac-DEX). Our previous data has
shown a dependence of particle degradation and optimal immune response against an influenza antigen. Not
only does the release of the antigen effect the immune response, the release of the adjuvant is also important.
The optimized degradation of both adjuvant and antigen has a drastic change in survival compared to non-
optimized formulations. Our particle system is unique because it relies on the highly tunable polymer Ac-DEX.
Ac-DEX is ideal for delivery of agents to phagocytic cells because it is acid-sensitive and has significantly
increased degradation in the low acid (~pH 5) of the phagosome. In addition to this it has tunable degradation
rates that can range from hours to months, which is a unique range from commonly used polyesters (e.g.
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)) that have degradation on the order of months. Moreover, Ac-DEX is unique
from polyesters because its degradation products are pH neutral, and do not have the potential to shift the local
pH or damage sensitive payloads. We have three specific aims exploring various optimizations of our particle
system. Aim 1 is focused on formulation of the polymer and particles. The release rate of the adjuvant will be
explored. Ac-DEX polymer with various cyclic acetal coverages will be fabricated to degrade over a broad range
of times. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the effect of loading of a novel influenza antigen either on the surface or
encapsulated into the MPs. We will explore degradation rates on antigen release as well as delivery routes in
determining the optimal delivery of influenza antigens that provide a broad range of protection. In Aim 3 we will
explore our optimized system in protecting ferrets. Ferrets are the ideal large animal model for influenza infection.
Using this model, we will evaluate the vaccine efficacy of our formulation, in comparison to a commercially
available flu vaccine."
10762435,"SUMMARY
Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the United States (US), diagnosed in 1.5-9.4 million Americans and
results in over 40,000 deaths each year. Every year 5-7% patients with cirrhosis experience life-threatening
decompensating events, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), or
develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These events often result in hospitalization, disability, or even death.
The challenge is to accurately predict those patients who are likely to develop decompensating events
and are likely to die. Accurate risk stratification of persons with cirrhosis will allow for early identification
and prioritization for guideline recommended care and emerging therapies (e.g., statins). Several
predictive models exist but none of them adequately answers this question. Furthermore, no longitudinal cost
of care analyses and cost prediction has been performed in the US for persons with cirrhosis. The care
of patients with cirrhosis is complex, often involving costly recurrent hospitalizations and procedures. In 2015,
the hospital costs alone were reported to be $16.3 billion. Our proposed research will analyze a large national
administrative health payer with detailed information on diagnoses, procedures, laboratory tests, medications,
in- and outpatient care, as well as standardized costs for insured Americans between 2011 and 2018. Such a
large population-based cirrhosis cohort, which includes cost data, offers a unique and unprecedented opportunity
to study disease progression, develop highly accurate prediction models, and study costs.
Aim 1. To describe the natural history of cirrhosis over time in a large longitudinal cohort of insured
Americans with liver cirrhosis in the United States
 Aim 1.1: Data preparation and variable transformation
Aim 1.2: Adjudicate potentially risk-relevant covariates by a cirrhosis stakeholder panel
Aim 1.3: Describe the natural history of cirrhosis

High-throughput, low-cost synthesis of long and complex DNA could open up new frontiers in synthetic biology, drug development, and genomics by facilitating the production and characterization of previously inaccessible genes and genetic pathways. Microarray printing technologies provide for high-throughput and low-cost synthesis of almost any oligonucleotide up to 300 bases long, while new technologies, such as enzymatic synthesis, have the potential to synthesize sequences de novo up to 2kb. To construct 2-5kb DNA blocks, oligonucleotides can be assembled using a suite of in vitro technologies, including polymerase cycling assembly, Gibson assembly, and Golden Gate assembly. However, application of in vitro technologies to assemble DNA longer than ~2-5kb requires considerable hands-on time, is difficult to multiplex and scale, is unreliable for construction of complex DNA (e.g. extreme GC content, homopolymers, repeats, DNA structure), and is extremely challenging for DNA longer than ~7kb. In addition, current methods to screen assemblies for sequence perfect clones are expensive and require considerable hands-on time or complex robotics. To overcome these hurdles, we have developed a novel, low-cost, highly multiplexed in vivo method to assemble long and complex DNA, and to sequence verify clones. In this method, arrays of DNA blocks are introduced into plasmids and bacteria, and these arrays are stitched together sequentially by bacterial mating. Following assembly, bacterial arrays are barcoded via another round of bacterial mating, enabling massively parallel DNA isolation and sequencing library preps from pooled clones. Compared to existing in vitro cloning our approach for stitching either oligos or DNA blocks together is up to 1 00X cheaper and requires up to 100X less hands-on time than current technologies, with no increase in total time. Importantly, in vivo assembly can assemble, at scale, DNA that is at least 15kb and that contains many regions of complex DNA. Here, we propose to harden, scale, and commercialize this technology by i) building a high-throughput production pipeline for in vivo DNA assembly and sequence validation, and ii) building a sequence analysis pipeline and database that will aid in both tracking and predicting error modes of in vivo DNA assembly. These aims will enable BacStitch to initially provide custom services and eventually standardized products that fulfill an unmet need for long and complex DNA."

 Neutrophils (PMNs, polymorphonuclear cells) are pivotal innate immune cells that directly mediate
pathogen clearance through release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, neutrophilic
extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytosis. The bacterial pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb)
antagonizes these antimicrobial actions by injecting critical virulence proteins, called Yops, into PMNs. We
seek to understand mechanisms that mediate clearance of bacterial pathogens in tissue infection by
understanding the processes that are disrupted by YopH and YopO. We have shown that SKAP2 is one
essential target of YopH in PMNs in tissue infection; however, SKAP2 is not the only essential target of YopH
in tissue infection. Missense mutations in SKAP2 are associated with the development of autoimmune
disorders and cancers. This suggests that PMN dysfunction downstream of SKAP2 signaling has wide ranging
implications beyond infection control. We have further shown that SKAP2-dependent mechanisms in
neutrophils are critical for limiting growth of another Gram-negative pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), in
lungs. Using PMNs derived from myeloid progenitor (MP) hematopoietic stem cells, we found that SKAP2 is
essential for extracellular (ROS) production but is not required for degranulation after Kp infection. Surprisingly,
SKAP2 is required for Syk phosphorylation after infection by Kp, but not for Syk phosphorylation after
stimulation of CLRs and integrin receptors, indicating that neutrophil recognition of Kp is via a distinct receptor,
possibly a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The objective of this application is to use our expertise in
murine infection models, MP-PMN genetic manipulation, bacterial genetics and live-cell visualization of protein
complexes, to understand pathways in PMNs that are targeted by YopH and YopO. We will further investigate
whether these targets play crucial roles in the control Kp. To this end, our specific aims are to (1) Dissect the
modular functions of SKAP2 required for generating anti-microbial responses in neutrophils after infection with
Kp. (2) Understand the effects of YopO on GPCR signaling in PMNs during murine infection. (3) Identify the
SKAP2-independent pathways that are targeted by YopH to inactivate neutrophil degranulation. After
completion of these studies, we will understand how SKAP2 and other Yop-targeted proteins work in PMNs to
control infection by Kp and Yptb. A thorough understanding of molecular mechanisms that signal for the
release of the tissue damaging bactericidal factors, ROS and granules, by PMNs during infection should lead
to novel and targeted approaches to manipulate these pathways to enhance these activities during infection
with multidrug resistant bacteria and to stop excessive damage due to uncontrolled PMN responses in a
variety of auto-immune diseases."

Also, the TMDDC facilitated creation or identification of 4 new patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from B/AA
patients with pancreatic cancer for studies at FAMU and USC. The TMDDC will continue to develop a robust,
well-annotated biorepository of fixed and living tissue samples from a racially and ethnically diverse Florida and
California patient population and make them available to the CaRE2 investigators. The TMDDC will consist of
existing institutional, nationally shared, and future-conscious biorepository resources. The short-term goals of
the TMDDC are to provide the necessary tissue samples for the three projects included in this application, while
preparing for the future needs of the existing and upcoming CaRE2 Center projects. The TMC will address the
challenge of recruiting B/AA and H/L individuals in medical research and the limited supply of quality
biospecimens and genomic data for these populations. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1. Advance our existing
virtual and physical repositories that will increasingly provide biospecimens from diverse tumor repositories
through a single access point provided by the CaRE2 Center. Many cancer types and many tissue models are
relevant to outcomes in disparities research. The broad types of tissues and data required to study these complex
issues make acquisition of a fully satisfactory repository beyond the scope of any single institution. Therefore,
we will develop capabilities to collect or acquire novel diverse and well annotated specimens through our
institutional resources and other resources. Aim 2. Acquire living tumor tissue for drug development. PDXs
have proven to better predict human drug responses than historically used cell-line derived studies. Development
of these PDXs has the potential to facilitate rapid drug development, including testing response as a function of
race/ancestry. The TMDDC will advance the existing Cycle 1 developed tissue repository at FAMU. The TMDDC
will advance on the existing living tissue repository at FAMU. By achieving these aims, we will: (1) enhance
cancer disparities tissue-modeling research; (2) expand cancer disparities resources for CaRE2 researchers,
and (3) ensure a sustained focus on transferring know-how, technology, and collaborations with FAMU.
Evaluation will be based on adequate provision of project-required specimens/resources and by success in
transferring drug development technology and knowhow to FAMU."
10761714,"Although there is notable evidence for ADHD abnormalities in the brain's reward system, that evidence is
limited due to both its narrow focus on a limited number of reward constructs, as well as its inconsistencies
across studies. We believe the inconsistencies are the result of unrecognized ADHD neurobiological
heterogeneity. This project was designed to test the prediction that ADHD is a disorder where several, wholly
different types of neurobiological dysfunction are capable of producing the same ADHD diagnostic phenotype.
Clear, decisive evidence for such neurocognitively and neurobiologically distinct ADHD subgroups is needed to
support an emerging paradigm shift in ADHD neuroscience away from the assumption that every ADHD
patient has similar pathophysiology, to a multi-etiology model that ultimately should prove to have greater
translational usefulness. Here, we will focus on better understanding reward dysfunction in ADHD, which is
relatively under-studied compared to the other neurocognitive abnormalities often found in the disorder. We
propose to examine a large (n=200) sample of ADHD-diagnosed and non-ADHD (n=150) adolescents with an
ambitious reward-based phenotyping approach using a diverse reward test battery to assess numerous
domains of reward behavior (e.g., different types of reinforcement learning, valuation, cost processing, effort
expenditure, etc.) – an approach that proved highly successful in our preliminary ADHD study. This battery
also will leverage the advances in reward phenotyping made over the past decade by sophisticated
computational modeling of reward choice behavior and reaction time data. We then will map aspects of
individual differences in these abilities to frontostriatal network connectivity during reinforcement learning
`prediction errors.' Our ultimate goal is to use this information to classify ADHD patients into different
biotypes. Although our preliminary data suggest there likely are at least two different reward-impaired ADHD
subgroups with disparate profiles of reward dysfunction, our approach will be more rigorous than a simple
replication attempt. We will test the fit of broad conceptual models of ADHD neurocognitive abnormality for
the first time in the reward domain, then use those findings to refine our approach to biotyping individual
cases with rigorous classification methodology. The resulting biotypes will be validated using other fMRI
reward tasks. This project will create the most detailed and extensive database describing reward dysfunction
in ADHD to date, which we will make freely available to the scientific community to accelerate the pace of
discovery. A renewed, concentrated focus on reward dysfunction in ADHD is not just timely, but also likely to
set the stage for important advances in future etiological and translational research. Different types of ADHD
reward dysfunction could represent untapped new targets for novel intervention development, where
treatments are matched to the type of neurobiological dysfunction instead of the broad DSM ADHD diagnosis."
10762335,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The gap junction (GJ) protein Connexin 43 (Cx43) has long been held to be obligate for conduction of action
potential (AP) in the ventricular myocardium. However, accumulating evidence during the last two decades from
non-mammals, Cx43 knockout mice and human Cx43 mutations suggests that Cx43 GJs do not provide a
sufficient explanation for how AP propagates in the heart – and indeed, that Cx43 GJs may be dispensable for
cardiac conduction. Based on its short half (~1.5 hours), we recently estimated that on average the human female
heart produces more than 80 grams of Cx43 per year – a rate more than 30-times that of actin, the most abundant
myocardial protein in steady state. My lab is focused on two questions that are raised by these data. First,
what is the mechanism of AP propagation in the ventricle, if Cx43 GJ-based coupling alone cannot account for
this phenomenon? Second, if not absolutely required for cardiac conduction, for what purpose does the heart
produce Cx43 at such high rates? In recently reported studies, we have determined that: A) Trans-
interacting complexes of voltage-gated sodium channels (trans-VGSCs) located at the GJ edge (the perinexus)
contribute to cardiac conduction; and B) That the Cx43 carboxyl terminus (CT) has key roles in modulating the
heart's response to ischemic injury. Building on these findings, the goals of this project are to: 1) Determine the
contribution of trans-VGSCs to cardiac AP propagation and the extent to which this mechanism operates
independent of Cx43 GJ-based coupling; 2) Develop a pharmacologic approach to targeting trans-VGSCs as a
novel anti-arrhythmic strategy; 3) Determine the extent to which the high levels of Cx43 production by the heart
may be accounted for by recent findings that Cx43 is exported in exosomes; 4) Determine whether circulating
exosomal Cx43, including Cx43 CT isoforms, are part of a natural signaling mechanism that modulates ischemic
injury severity; and 5) Develop a novel therapeutic approach to treat myocardial infarction based on exosomes
carrying Cx43 CT mimetic peptides, including translational testing in a large animal model – the pig. The project
will involve cross-disciplinary collaboration between biologists, medicinal chemists, biomedical engineers and
clinicians – both human and veterinary. The PI has genuine translational bona-fides, with a drug targeting the
Cx43 CT invented in his lab currently in multiple Phase III clinical trials. State-of-the-art approaches will be used
including super resolution imaging, in silico drug design, genetically modified viruses, iPSCs and testing of
exosome-based therapeutics on large animal models. We posit that the primary assignment of myocardial Cx43
may not be in AP propagation. Rather, it is our hypothesis that the high energetic commitment to Cx43
production made by the heart, and other tissues (e.g., skin, vasculature and brain), relates mainly to functions of
Cx43 in an exosome-based signaling mechanism that modulates response to ischemic injury in humans and other
mammals. This R35 project seeks to challenge prevailing views on the role of the GJ protein Cx43 and translate
the new perspectives gained for clinical benefit in treatment of arrhythmia and myocardial infarction."
10761737,"SUMMARY
The textbook view of bacterial genomes shows a set of discrete genes, transcribed individually or as operons.
Transcription initiates at promoters upstream of these genes/operons, producing mostly protein-coding mRNAs
along with a smaller number of stable, functional RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, sRNAs). Transcription factors bind close
to promoters and regulate transcription from those promoters. Transcription terminates downstream of genes, in
3’ UTRs. This view has been the basis for decades of work on gene expression and gene regulation, with
enormous advances in our understanding of these processes. However, work from my group and others has
shown that bacterial genomes are far more complex. We will leverage my expertise in genetics, genomics, and
molecular biology, to continue productive lines of research on four overlapping topics that relate to the major
research focus of my group: the unexpected complexity of bacterial genomes. My lab has been very
productive on this topic, with 19 papers since 2016 directly relevant to the four themes described in this proposal.
Topic #1. Pervasive transcription. We and others have shown that most bacterial promoters are not in
intergenic regions, upstream of genes. Rather, they are located within genes, in sense or antisense orientations,
and are involved in “pervasive transcription”, whereby short, non-coding RNAs are transcribed before being
rapidly terminated by Rho and degraded. The majority of these RNAs are believed to be non-functional, and
suppression of pervasive transcription is required to maintain cell fitness.
Topic #2. Non-canonical transcription factor (TF) binding. We have mapped the direct and indirect regulatory
targets of hundreds of TFs across a wide range of bacterial species. Most TF binding sites are located within
genes, not intergenic regions. Moreover, most TF binding events are not associated with detectable regulation
of a nearby gene. Our data also show that in vivo binding profiles are often not well explained by a DNA sequence
motif, suggesting a role for other factors in determining the genomic sites of TF binding.
Topic #3. Widespread gene regulation by attenuation. We have shown that transcription of many Escherichia
coli genes is prematurely terminated by the conserved termination factor Rho, either in the 5’ UTR or ORF, a
process commonly referred to as “attenuation”. Attenuation has been described previously, but our data indicate
that it happens on a much larger scale than previously appreciated. We are interested in the mechanisms of
attenuation involving Rho termination, with a particular focus on the role of upstream ORFs (uORFs) that function
as cis-acting regulators, since we have identified large numbers of these ORFs in diverse bacterial species.
Topic #4. Processive antitermination. RNA polymerase can be protected from the action of the Rho
termination factor in a process known as “processive antitermination”. We will identify new regulatory targets of
known antiterminator proteins, we will determine the mechanisms of antitermination, and we will discover new
antiterminator proteins."

This application is for a Phase IIb (R44) renewal of AG066384 titled “GMP production of a tau oligomer inhibitor to enable clinical development for ADRD”. We completed the preclinical work and submitted our IND application to FDA and are ready to begin our first-in-human phase 1a study in January 2023. This application is to perform a study needed to prepare for a phase 1b clinical study designed to look for early clinical signs of efficacy/proof-of-concept by evaluating the response to treatment of relevant serum and CSF biomarkers in a double blinded study of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This program is progressing to fill the urgent, growing unmet need for disease modifying therapeutics (DMT) for AD with an economical, DMT that is stable, oral, and that can be self-administered. If successful, it will have a tremendous impact on the more than 6.5 million Americans who currently have AD (projected to be 12.7 million by 2050) and their caregivers and will help reduce the current cost of $321 billion (projected to be $1 trillion by 2050) to our nation (Alzheimer's Association 2022 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures). Results of the preclinical studies have shown that TO-0582 demonstrated: pharmacologic activity in two mouse models of tauopathy (htau, expressing the 6 CNS human tau isoforms representing tau aggregation in AD; JNPL3, that expresses 4R tau with the P301L mutation that represents four-repeat tauopathies), reasonable pharmacokinetic characteristics, minimal DDI potential, lack/minimal effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary and CNS systems, and a lack of genotoxicity. Relatively modest, non-adverse toxicity was observed in 28-day rat and dog GLP toxicity studies. The no adverse effect level for both the rat and dog 28-day studies were the highest dose tested. Additional testing at higher doses is necessary to demonstrate toxicity limiting dosing to establish a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to enable dosing at sufficient levels in humans. Manufacture of kilogram quantities for non-clinical safety studies (NCSS) and drug pre-formulation work has been completed. The GMP batch met specifications for 24-month stability and was used to manufacture drug product OLX-07010 that has recently met specifications for 12-month stability testing. Methods development and manufacture of compound has been demonstrated at a 5 Kg scale (funded by 1R44AG077991-01A1). The Aims of this proposal are to synthesize 10 Kg of TO-0582AA and to use this material to perform studies to demonstrate toxicity limiting doses and NOAELs in rats and dogs. Manufacture of compound will be performed by Curia (Albany, NY), and the toxicity studies will be performed by Charles River Laboratories (Ashland, OH). As the National Institute on Aging is the primary Federal agency for AD research, the development of a DMT for AD has the highest relevance for its mission."

10896950,"Over 316 million people are living with chronic hepatitis B and as many as one quarter of people living with HIV
have hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection. HIV-HBV co-infection increases levels of HBV replication, liver
disease development, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The key to HBV persistence is nucleus-
resident, long-lived covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) coding for all viral proteins. Nucleos(t)ide
analogue therapy (NUC) effectively reduces HBV DNA in the serum by halting reverse transcription of
pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Recently, NUC therapy has been associated with cccDNA transcriptional silencing
leading to reduced pgRNA levels in the liver and HBV RNA in the serum, however cccDNA quantities across
the liver remain stable. Efforts to develop a cure for HBV focus on the removal or long term control of cccDNA
activity, the latter yielding a functional cure. An alternative treatment to NUC is pegylated interferon-α (PEG-
IFN), a potent antiviral therapy with comparatively greater rates of functional cure (7%), defined as a durable
loss of serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). A study following participants before and after PEG-IFN found
that treatment non-responders had elevated proportions of spliced HBV (spHBV) DNA from total HBV DNA,
supporting a role of spHBV in modulating IFN responsiveness. There are 20 identified spHBV transcripts
derived from pgRNA, a subset of which encode noncanonical HBV proteins. A limited number of studies have
demonstrated that spHBV expression disrupts IFN response signaling and possibly alters cccDNA
transcription. Given their putative role in modulating the host immune response and viral transcription, we
propose to compare spHBV in HBV mono-infection and HIV-HBV co-infection. Combining use of a novel
multiprobe multiplex droplet digital PCR with direct sequencing, we will characterize spHBV in HIV-HBV co-
infection and HBV monoinfection in serum from individuals in the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study. We
expect an enrichment of spHBV RNA within total HBV RNA in co-infection compared to mono-infection.
Additionally, we will model the decay of spHBV during NUC in HIV-HBV co-infection and compare spHBV
expression in the same person’s liver and blood. Additionally, we will perform deep sequencing of hepatocytes
with high vs low HBV transcription in an HIV-HBV coinfection ancillary study of the Hepatitis B Research
Network, focusing on innate response pathway genes. We will then overexpress candidate spHBV that are
likely to affect IFN responses in HepG2-NTCP cells. Conversely, we will use siRNA to knockdown candidate
spHBV and measure IFN responses in an HBV infected HepG2-NTCP cells. Using this model in the context of
HBV infection, we will measure the interplay between cccDNA transcription, spHBV expression, and innate
signaling. This study will be the first characterization of spHBV in HIV-HBV co-infection and has the goal of
identifying novel therapeutic targets specifically affecting cccDNA transcription in CHB."
10768615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hip fractures are common, costly, and strongly associated with morbidity and mortality. For patients with
chronic kidney disease (CKD), fracture risk and post-fracture mortality are double what they are in the general
population; and dialysis patients sustain hip fractures 10-15 years younger than their age-matched
counterparts.
 Treatment for hip fracture in CKD is particularly challenging because these patients have multiple different
pathologies of bone disease, and the distinct pathologies have different treatments. Patients with CKD can
have age-related osteoporosis similar to non-CKD patients, but may also have CKD-related metabolic bone
disease reflecting low turnover disease, high turnover disease (typically driven by hyperparathyroidism) or
mixed lesions, even at the same level of bone mineral density. Low bone turnover in CKD patients appears to
be increasing in frequency, and is problematic as most standard anti-fracture medications may exacerbate low
turnover bone disease. On the other hand, there are now several FDA approved treatments that stimulate,
rather than suppress, bone turnover. Thus, it is particularly timely to understand bone turnover in CKD patients,
and ultimately see if this information can guide clinicians to improve patient outcomes.
 Bone biopsy and histomorphometry are the gold standard for determining bone turnover. These methods
are not widely available and are rarely obtained due to only a few specialized centers performing them. When
available, however, bone histomorphometry is typically evaluated at the iliac crest, which is poorly correlated
with bone turnover at other bone sites including the hip. In order to better understand bone turnover at the hip,
we propose histomorphometry using hip bone tissue taken during surgical repair of hip fracture in CKD patients
as it may deliver relevant information about bone metabolism and structure. Specifically, we will determine the
prevalence and risk factors for low bone turnover in hip fracture patients with CKD (Aim 1).
 Without biopsy, clinicians are limited in their ability to identify a subset of patients with low bone turnover.
Our preliminary data suggest biomarkers hold promise to identify low bone turnover with high specificity in
CKD patients. Yet, the optimal biomarker panel to define low bone turnover at the hip does not currently exist.
We propose to develop a panel using serum biomarkers based on findings from hip bone biopsy and
histomorphometry indicative of low bone turnover (Aim 2). Our recent findings suggest that using serum
biomarkers that are specific for low bone turnover based on iliac crest histomorphometry can be applied to
community-living individuals with CKD and provide important information on future fracture risk. Thus, we will
apply these biomarkers based on bone turnover at the hip to a cohort of women with CKD who are well-
characterized for bone mineral density and fractures (in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures) to determine hip
fracture risk in this subset of individuals (Aim 3)."
10768616,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cell-cell communication lies at the heart of evolution of multi-cellular life: cells send specific signals to instruct
their neighbors to adopt fates distinct of their own. An important class of developmental signals is encoded by
the Wnt gene family. Wnt proteins interact with their cognate receptors of the Frizzled (Fzd) family to control
countless developmental processes, from establishing the polarity of a single cell within a tissue to specifying
the anterior-posterior body axis of an organism. Deregulation of Wnt signaling can have catastrophic
consequences, including embryonic lethality, birth defects, and disease. With their diverse and potent activities
in development and stem cells, Wnt proteins hold great promise as potent tools in cell and tissue engineering.
The long-term objective of our research is to gain a better understanding of how Wnt proteins and their
downstream signaling events influence cell fate decisions, and thereby advance technologies and treatments
that specifically target Wnt signaling. Over the past years, we have made important contributions to the
development of Wnts as research-grade reagents to manipulate human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells and
generate cell populations with potential therapeutic value. However, significant challenges need to be
addressed before the full potential of Wnts as therapeutics can be realized. In particular, despite their potent
activities, many Wnt proteins remain difficult to isolate in a biologically active and stable form. Furthermore,
with 19 Wnts and over 20 Wnt receptors (including Fzd1-10, Lrp5/6, Ror1/2, etc.) encoded in the mammalian
genome, it is unclear how signaling specificity is established. Finally, many current attempts to target Wnt
signaling in clinical settings are highly non-specific and produce complications and adverse side effects.
The goal for the next five years is to leverage an innovative technology developed in our laboratory that utilizes
engineered Wnt agonists, called Wnt mimetics, which exhibit superior biochemical properties compared to
native Wnt proteins. These Wnt mimetics will be tested for their effects in several settings, including hPS cell
self-renewal and differentiation, organoid cultures and in whole animals (mice). Furthermore, the proposed
research will explore a new paradigm for how Wnt signaling specificity is established in vivo, and thereby
enable the development of tools and approaches that pinpoint individual Wnt signaling pathways. These
experiments will allow us to test our hypothesis that selective engagement and activation of individual Wnt
receptors and receptor complexes trigger distinct signaling outputs and biological effects.
The proposed research will significantly advance the field of stem cell research and tissue engineering by
establishing new tools and methods to manipulate Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. With its abundant roles in
human disorders and diseases, a better understanding of Wnt signaling is essential for the development of
novel therapies for currently incurable diseases."
10768707,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial changes to American neighborhoods in ways that are only
beginning to be elucidated. There has been an excess of permanent business closures, particularly among
small neighborhood businesses most vulnerable to social distancing, such as local barber shops and nail
salons. COVID-19 outbreaks in late September 2021 caused 2,000 neighborhood schools to close for an
average of six days in 39 states. A burgeoning body of research has tried to understand the forces driving
these trends, focusing on infectious disease transmission at the individual level or economic models at the
business level. What is not considered is the context in which these changes are taking place. By context, we
mean the neighborhood community environment that holds the opportunities, restrictions, risks, and flexibility
for post-pandemic growth, including job opportunities in business sectors robust to social distancing;
comprehensive broadband internet access to facilitate telemedicine, online schooling, remote work, and online
grocery shopping; parks and walkable streets to facilitate socially distanced physical activity and social
interaction to mitigate social isolation brought on by the pandemic; and the provision of medical care through
the availability of alternate health care providers and pharmacies. Access to these neighborhood resources is
not equally distributed across America, reinforcing risk for vulnerable populations, including older adults,
children and adolescents, racial/ethnic minorities, and those in rural areas. However, a lack of national,
standardized, longitudinal metrics of the local neighborhood environment has hindered the ability to identify
which communities are most vulnerable to the immediate and longer-term consequences of the pandemic for a
host of behavioral, psychological, social, and economic outcomes. To address this limitation in the nation's
data infrastructure, we will augment, curate and disseminate data from our National Neighborhood Data
Archive (NaNDA), which includes a wealth of physical, social and economic characteristics of the local
neighborhood across the United States (e.g., racial segregation, business density, environmental hazards,
broadband internet access, and healthcare availability), in the years both before and since the pandemic. We
will participate with the Consortium on Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 to integrate,
share, and analyze spatially referenced neighborhood data that can be readily linked to existing survey data,
cohort studies, or electronic health records at various levels of geography. We will work with the COVID-19
Consortium Coordination Center to identify and create key neighborhood metrics that are priorities for research
teams in the Consortium, including a set of common data elements (CDEs) on the social, behavioral and
economic indicators of the COVID-19 pandemic at the neighborhood level. We will also develop new metrics of
longitudinal neighborhood change in the decades preceding the pandemic, which can inform community risk
and resilience since the pandemic."
10781909,"Project Summary/Abstract
For pediatric patients with RAS-mutated tumors, clinical trials testing targeted therapies are limited due to the
paucity of preclinical data. This is unfortunate, as targeted therapies have the potential to make a significant
impact on morbidity for pediatric patients. Cytotoxic agents significantly delay normal childhood development
leading to lifelong sequalae. In contrast, targeted therapies that preferentially attack RAS-mutated tumor cells
while sparing normal developing tissue can limit unwanted sequalae and enhance overall outcomes for pediatric
cancer patients. Unfortunately, single-agent targeting of RAS-mutated cancer cells using either MEK inhibitors
or mutant RAS inhibitors is largely ineffective; resistance rapidly develops due to upregulation of multiple RTKs
and subsequent hyperactivation of WT RAS signaling. Thus, alternative therapeutic approaches are needed to
treat RAS-mutated pediatric cancers. Toward this end, we take two complementary approaches at inhibiting WT
RAS signaling designed to enhance the effectiveness of targeted therapies in RAS-mutated pediatric cancers.
While each approach seems obvious in hindsight, neither has been tested in pre-clinical models of RAS-mutated
pediatric cancers.
We first examine the extent to which broad inhibition of proximal RTK signaling using inhibitors to the common
proximal RTK signaling intermediates SHP2 or SOS1 enhances the efficacy of and delays therapeutic resistance
to MEK or mutant RAS inhibitors in RAS-mutated non-CNS pediatric cancer cells. Since MEK inhibition induces
compensatory RTK-dependent signaling cascades, co-targeting RTK signaling with MEK is an attractive
approach to treat RAS-mutated pediatric cancers. However, studies in multiple RAS-mutated cancers revealed
that the specific RTK that is reactivated can vary between cell lines or studies, even within the same cancer type.
Thus, rather than using specific RTK inhibitors that may differ for each patient, we inhibit the common proximal
RTK signaling intermediates SHP2 or SOS1, and use both pharmacologic and drug resistance assays to
determine which drug-drug combinations are the most potent at enhancing drug killing and inhibiting therapeutic
resistance. We then test the most promising therapeutic combinations in patient-derived xenograft models.
As a second approach, we determine the extent to which combined inhibition of mutant RAS and WT RAS
effector signaling enhances the efficacy of and delays therapeutic resistance to mutant RAS inhibitors in RAS-
mutated non-CNS pediatric cancer cells. RAS proteins show differential activation of RAF and PI3K pathways:
HRAS potently activates PI3K but poorly activates RAF, whereas KRAS potently activates RAF but poorly
activates PI3K. Since both MEK and PI3K pathways must be inhibited for effective killing of RAS-mutated
pediatric cancers, we use this fundamental understanding of signaling differences between mutant RAS family
members to examine rational therapeutic approaches in RAS-mutated non-CNS pediatric cancer cells. We then
test the most promising therapeutic combinations in patient-derived xenograft models."
10781912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neural dynamics in motor cortex are necessary for dexterous behavior, but the mechanisms that generate
these activity patterns are unclear. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how cortical dynamics
are constructed to control movement, so that therapies could be developed to identify and repair aberrant
activity patterns associated with motor disorders. My laboratory recently showed that these cortical dynamics
arise from a collaboration between the intrinsic properties of cortex and inputs from the rest of the brain, but
how distinct input streams are received and processed by the cortex remains poorly understood. To
characterize these operations, we must understand the identity of the contributing inputs and their relationship
to cortical dynamics. The objective of this proposal is to directly test the role of two major inputs, from ventral
anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamic nuclei, to primary motor cortex. VA and VL have distinguishable
input/output features: VA receives more input from basal ganglia, VL receives more input from cerebellum, VA
and VL project to distinct cortical targets, and their intrinsic physiological properties differ. The central
hypothesis to be tested here is that the VA-to-cortex pathway modulates, while the VL-to-cortex pathway
drives, cortical dynamics and control of movement. To test the roles of VA and VL in the construction of cortical
dynamics and behavior, we produced and validated genetic tools in the mouse that allow selective monitoring
and manipulation of specific thalamic nuclei. With these tools, we will assess the relationship between a
cortically dependent prehension task and the activity patterns of VA and VL neurons. We will then determine
how activity in VL and VA drive or modulate cortical activity. Efforts to model the production of cortical
commands have focused almost exclusively on firing patterns of cortex, leaving aside the influence of external
inputs, leading to a cortico-centric view of pattern generation. With the data we collect, we will generate a more
realistic computational model for pattern generation that considers the role of both intrinsic cortical dynamics
and external inputs. Thus completion of these aims will advance understanding of how the cortical dynamics
underlying prehension are constructed through interactions with the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The
proposed research is innovative because it will use a new genetic toolbox for exploring thalamus, will produce
an in-depth assessment of thalamocortical dynamics during a new complex prehension task, will advance the
use of causal perturbations for testing interactions between brain regions, and will generate a more holistic
model for pattern generation for dexterous behavior. The proposed work is significant because understanding
the relationships among cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia can elucidate how their damage or disease
leads to motor disorders and support the development of therapies designed to replace lost or corrupted
signals."

The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) has made significant contributions in advancing the
evidence base for cardiothoracic surgery. As the population ages and the incidence of cardiovascular disease
remains high, there is an important public health need to expand the capacity of the CTSN. Northern New
England (NNE) is home to the most rural and elderly population in the US. Individuals living in NNE are
medically underserved and face significant socioeconomic challenges. These conditions occur in the context of
higher rates of comorbid conditions, leading to a high cardiovascular disease burden and lower life expectancy.
Importantly, rural patients are underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials.
As hospitals located in NNE, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and Maine Medical Center (MMC)
share a common goal of improving the health of rural communities. Specific aims are: (1) to expand the
capacity of the CTSN in rural populations with high cardiovascular disease burden and develop strategies for
implementing trial findings in such patients; (2) to support the development and clinical research capacity at
MMC; and (3) to train the next generation of implementation science researchers through the Clinical and
Implementation Research Skills Program (CIRSP). Several unique features of this collaboration will allow
achievement of these aims. First, DHMC and MMC are the major referral centers for cardiac surgery in NNE,
ensuring an ideal setting for recruiting patients with a high cardiovascular disease burden. Second, DHMC is
an international leader in the use of regional and national registries to facilitate population-based research.
DHMC is the data coordinating center for Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group
(NNECDSG) which collects data on 90% of cardiac surgery in NNE. DHMC also maintains the largest non-
federal repository of Medicare data in the US through the Dartmouth Atlas. Third, Dr. Iribarne has 11 years of
experience with the CTSN and brings significant knowledge of lessons learned on optimal recruitment
strategies for enrolling cardiac surgery patients. Fourth, DHMC and MMC have worked collaboratively in
quality improvement since 1987 through the NNECDSG; the Linked Clinical Research Center (LCRC) program
is a natural extension of this collaboration. Fifth, a group of nationally recognized experts in implementation
science has been assembled to educate CIRSP Scholars in late-stage implementation research.
The expected results are that: (1) the capacity of the CTSN will expand into rural populations with high
cardiovascular disease burden; (2) implementation science will be integrated in future CTSN research; (3)
MMC will be a leading enroller in CTSN trials; and (4) early career investigators will be trained in and perform
late-stage implementation research using the CTSN infrastructure. These results will support the mission of the

Homelessness severely affects health and well-being and is particularly negative for youth. Between 70-95% of
youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report problem substance use and 66-89% have a mental health
disorder. Youth appear to be at greater risk for living on the streets or being homeless than adults and are more
vulnerable to long term consequences of homelessness. Multiple social determinants of health (SDOH) are
uniquely associated with homelessness, driving substance use and adverse mental health consequences.
However, limited research has identified pragmatic interventions that have a long-term ameliorating impact on
the complex, multi-symptomatic issues among these youth. This study overcomes prior gaps in research through
testing a multi-component comprehensive prevention intervention targeting SDOH that may affect
biopsychosocial health indicators and longer-term health outcomes. In partnership with Star House, a drop-in
center for YEH, youth between the ages of 14 to 24 years, will be engaged and randomly assigned to conditions
using a dismantling design so that essential intervention components can be efficiently identified. In particular,
youth (N = 300) will be randomly assigned to a) Motivational Interviewing/Community Reinforcement Approach
+ Services as Usual (MI/CRA + SAU, n = 80), b) Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy + SAU (SBOA +
SAU, n = 80), c) MI/CRA + SBOA + SAU (n = 80) or d) SAU (n=60) through the drop-in center. In order to assess
the longer-term prevention effects on substance use, mental health and other outcomes, all youth will be
assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24-months post-baseline. The primary goal of this study is to
establish the impact of a comprehensive intervention embedded within a system that serves YEH, a community
drop-in center, on youth’s opioid misuse and disorder, other substance misuse and disorders, mental health
diagnoses, and other targeted outcomes. This study will offer unique information on pathways underlying change
for specific subgroups of youth along with cost estimates to inform future implementation efforts in drop-in centers
around the country."

 Metoidioplasty and phalloplasty gender affirming surgeries (MaPGAS) are increasingly performed but
remain high risk procedures that require patients to make complex decisions affecting future gender
congruence, fertility, urinary, and sexual function. Prior studies demonstrate there is decisional uncertainty
among transgender and non-binary individuals assigned female at birth considering MaPGAS which may lead
to poor decision quality and outcomes. In these high risk surgical decisions with multiple options with clinical
equipoise, it is paramount to empower patients with decision support that facilitates quality decisions that are
well informed, deliberated, and align with personal goals and values. However, there is a lack of validated
MaPGAS decision support due to a historical lack of understanding of patients’ decisional needs and dearth of
high quality published outcomes or guidelines. Taken together, this limits the extent of MaPGAS counseling
and shared decision making, potentially leading to poor quality decisions and unexpected outcomes.
 In our prior R21 we used a mixed methods design grounded in the Ottawa Decision Support
Framework with community and provider stakeholders, to identify key themes surrounding patient surgical
goals, values, and decision moderators from geographically diverse locations in the US. This was combined
with a systematic review of the literature and modified Delphi consensus of high volume MaPGAS surgeons
on patient focused surgical outcomes to create, iteratively revise, and sandpit test a community developed,
web-based MaPGAS picture decision aid (DA) prototype. The DA provides information on the most common
MaPGAS options and a decision support tool applicable to patients of various health literacy levels.
 The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the usability and acceptability of the MaPGAS DA using a
mixed methods approach including the validated System Usability Scale triangulated with key stakeholder
focus groups feedback. Further, to 2) evaluate preliminary MaPGAS DA efficacy through a prospective
randomized controlled trial at two geographically diverse institutions. The primary outcome includes change in
pre and post DA decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale) and decision readiness (Preparation for
Decision Making Scale) as compared to usual care. The secondary outcome will include post-surgical
consultation evaluation with the CollaboRATE measure coupled with semi structured patient and provider
interviews on optimal DA administration timing, implementation, and impact on shared decision making.
 Successful completion of this study will refine the MaPGAS DA, test preliminary efficacy, and inform a
larger prospective study designed to test broader acceptability, efficacy, and ultimately improve MaPGAS
shared decision making."
10776636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposures to prenatal traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), a primary contributor to urban air pollution, have
been linked to adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth (PTB). Notably, communities of color, especially
African American people, are disproportionately exposed to high TRAP levels and experience elevated rates of
PTB. The mechanisms underlying how maternal TRAP exposures may affect birth outcomes and shape child
health disparities are still largely unknown, due, in part, to substantial challenges in accurately characterizing
internal dose and biological responses to TRAP. Through the advancement in high-throughput analytical
techniques and new bioinformatics methods, our work and the work of others have demonstrated that several
omics platforms can be used in concert to identify sensitive biological signals associated with exogenous
TRAP exposures and PTB. Existing studies, including our own, have been limited in refined exposure
characterization, sample size (limiting ability to detect effects), focusing on a single exposure without much
attention to mixture, and, most importantly, did not examine the specific mechanistic roles of each molecule
from different omics layers and how they bridge the gap from TRAP exposures to PTB. To address these
critical knowledge gaps, we propose the Omics and Mixtures Integration on Traffic exposure and Preterm Birth
(OMIT-PTB) study to integrate and analyze longitudinal multi-omics data, spanning the maternal epigenome,
metabolome, and microbiome, to characterize the molecular connections between maternal exposures to
TRAP and PTB. Our innovative OMIT-PTB proposal will leverage the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child
Cohort, an exceptionally phenotyped prospective pregnancy cohort. We will conduct state-of-art multi-omics
profiling and integration during early and late pregnancy, innovative mixture analyses, and advanced
assessment of cumulative and short-term exposures to TRAP on 700 pregnant people in this cohort.
Specifically, we will conduct independent epigenome- (Aim 1), multi-stage metabolome- (Aim 2), and
microbiome- (Aim 3) wide association studies to identify biological markers and pathways associated with
prenatal TRAP exposures. Using advanced bioinformatic tools, we will conduct both a posteriori integration
(Aim 4a) and a priori integration (Aim 4b) to simultaneously analyze multi-omics data to investigate the
molecular connections between TRAP and PTB. The OMIT-PTB study will, for the first time, provide novel
insights and comprehensive information on signatures of systemic biological perturbation linking TRAP
exposures to PTB, leading to the identification of biological signals and markers (i.e., validated DNA
methylation pattern at CpG sites, metabolites and metabolic pathways, microbial taxa and community types).
These findings will contribute to elucidating potentially sensitive TRAP biomarkers and preclinical indicators for
PTB - a meaningful step for defining novel intervention strategies to mitigate TRAP exposure risk and improve
birth and health outcomes in exposed mothers and children."
10771988,"Cardiovascular inflammation promotes Heart failure (HF) development. However, mechanism of cardiac
inflammation resolution during HF development is still poorly understood. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)
is a protein that keeps the body’s immune responses in check, both by inhibiting initial T cell induction and by
maintaining T cell tolerance. PD1 blocking antibodies are used in cancer treatment, but the treatment also leads
to cardiac toxicity in some patients. We found that PD1 KO or PD1 blocking antibodies dramatically exacerbated
transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac inflammation, HF, and death, indicating PD1 exerts a more
important role under stress conditions. To understand mechanisms of PD1 inhibition in cardiac inflammation, we
studied cardiac immune cells and vascular endothelial cells from wild type and PD1 KO mice after sham or TAC
by using single-cell CITE-seq together with barcoded antibodies for membrane protein labeling. Using single-cell
CITE-seq, we also studied lung immune cells from HF mice and sham mice. Bioinformatics analyses have
provided enormously information of these cells – showing dramatic alterations of cell clusters, enriched pathways
of innate & adaptive immune responses, and changes of metabolic pathways in various immune cell subsets in
HF mice, or in PD1 KO after TAC. gdT cells (a subset of T cells) can be divided into either IL-17 (gdT17) or IFNg
producers. CITE-seq of lung immune cells showed that HF caused dramatic changes of various T cell and
macrophage clusters, a dramatic increase of PD1 in Th17 and gdT17 cells, suggesting PD1 exerts an important
role in suppressing Th17, and gdT17 cells as well as HF progression. CITE-seq in cardiac immune cells showed
that infiltration of CD8+ T cells and gdT cells increased in PD1 KO mice after TAC, and these infiltrated cells are
IFNg+ cells, indicating that CD8+ T cells, gdT cells, and IFNg may contribute to the exacerbated cardiac
inflammation in PD1 KO mice. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that TAC-induced cardiac and
pulmonary inflammation resolution is regulated by PD1 through both conserved and unique pathways at least
partially controlled by IFNg and IL17 produced by CD8+ T cells, gdT cells, and Th17, respectively. To enhance
the innovative rigor of our investigation of the role of PD1 in cardiac inflammation and HF, we will also study CD8
cell specific PD1 KO mice. Aim-1. Test the hypothesis that IFNg and CD8+ T cells contribute to the exacerbated
cardiac inflammation, cytokine storm, and HF in PD1 KO after TAC. In additon, we will determine whether PD1
KO in CD8+ T cells is sufficient to exacerbate TAC-induced cardiac inflammation and HF. Aim-2. Determine the
roles and underlying mechanisms of IL17 and gdT cells in promoting TAC-induced cardiac inflammation and HF
after PD1 inhibition. This application is highly responsive to the Notice of Special Interest NOT-ES-20-018 as the
proposed studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of PD1 and T cells in cardiac and lung
inflammation resolution, and the conserved & unique changes in cardiac and lung immune cell clusters during
HF development and progression."

Asthma exacerbations among U.S children result in 640,000 emergency department visits and 14 million
missed school days annually. Viral infections trigger the majority of exacerbations in children, of which human
rhinoviruses (HRV) are the most common. The airway epithelium plays central roles in regulating
inflammation, airway remodeling responses, and innate immune responses to infection. The most striking
response of airway epithelial cells (AECs) to viral infection is expression of type I and III interferons (IFN I/III)
and IFN stimulated genes (ISG). Some have reported deficient IFN I/III responses to viral infection by
asthmatic AECs and postulated that deficient epithelial IFN responses to viruses predispose to exacerbations,
whereas others have not observed differences in AEC IFN responses to viruses between asthmatic and
healthy AECs. In our unique cohort of well characterized asthmatic and healthy children, from whom we obtain
bronchial and nasal AECs and conduct mechanistic experiments using air-liquid-interface organotypic culture
models, we have observed significant heterogeneity in IFN I/III responses to HRV and RSV infection. For
example, among our asthmatic AEC donors we have noted associations between high type I/III IFN responses
and lower donor lung function, as well as distinct subgroups of exacerbation prone asthmatics with deficient
IFN I/III responses to HRV. Heterogeneity in AEC IFN I/III responses to viral infections may be explained by
polymorphisms in genes coding for viral sensors and/or key steps in signal transduction pathways upstream of
IFN I and III. The overall goal my research program is to understand how airway epithelial responses
influence viral-triggered exacerbations and airway remodeling mechanisms in asthmatic children. In the
first aim, using primary cells from children with asthma we will test our hypothesis that polymorphisms in
genes coding for viral sensors, and/or key steps in signal transduction pathways upstream of IFN responses,
contribute to heterogeneity in IFN I/III responses to HRV infection by AECs from asthmatic children. In the
second aim, we will prospectively follow a cohort of asthmatic children to test our hypothesis that deficient
AEC IFN I/III responses to HRV are associated with a greater incidence of viral-triggered exacerbations in AEC
donors. In the final aim, we will test our hypothesis that excessively high IFN I/III responses by asthmatic
AECs to HRV are associated with lung function decline among AEC donors, and we will interrogate potential
mechanisms whereby excessively high IFN I/III responses may promote proliferation and activation of lung
stromal cells. The studies conducted in my research program and unique resource of primary airway epithelial
cells from clinically well characterized asthmatic children provide an exceptional training environment for young
investigators dedicated to a career in mechanistic patient-oriented research to learn translational research
techniques to investigate the role of the airway epithelium in pediatric lung diseases and viral infection."

The key parameters of small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) are its spatial resolution and sensitivity
that determine the ability to image and quantify radiotracers in a small region of the subject at sub-nanomolar
concentrations. However, the applications of small-animal PET have been limited in its application by a
combination of spatial resolution and sensitivity, which hampers the use of PET for a range of applications
including mouse brain imaging, aortic microcalcification and inflammation imaging, high-resolution total-body
dynamic imaging and kinetic modeling studies with using image-derived input function.
The goals of this proposal are 1) to develop a 0.5 mm resolution total-body small-animal PET scanner dedicated
for high-resolution and fast dynamic applications for imaging mouse disease models, and 2) provide a pre-clinical
tool using mouse models to develop, validate, characterize the paradigms and protocols that will feed into human
studies, such as total-body and brain studies. The proposed PET scanner will have 128 depth-of-interaction
(DOI) detectors. The ring diameter and the axial length are 110 mm and 167 mm, respectively, which is designed
to cover the entire body of the mouse and to obtain high resolution and high sensitivity across the entire body.
Dual-ended readout detectors based on linearly-graded silicon photomultipliers (LG-SiPMs) coupled to both ends
of 40 x 40 lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) arrays with a pitch size of 0.5 mm and length of 20 mm will
be used to extract DOI information to maintain high and uniform spatial resolution across the entire body of the
mouse. LYSO is chosen due to its high light yield (for high spatial resolution and energy resolution), high stopping
power (for high sensitivity), and fast decay time (high event rate ability).
Dedicated data acquisition electronics for dual-ended readout detectors will be designed for the proposed
scanner by upgrading our well-studied electronics system, and a signal multiplexing readout method will be used
to reduce the 40 signals of each detector to 9 signals (8 for position information and 1 for timing information) to
reduce the cost, complexity, and heat of the readout electronics.
The outcome of this proposal will be a total-body small animal PET scanner with a resolution < 0.5 mm and a
sensitivity ~24.5 % at the center of the field of view. The resolution will be ~0.5 mm and the sensitivity will be
better than 15 % across the volume of the mouse. The spatial/volume resolution is more than 2x/8x better than
currently available small-animal PET scanners with similar sensitivity, and the sensitivity is more than 20x better
than currently available small-animal PET scanners with similar resolution. The proposed scanner can promote
the use of total-body small-animal PET for monitoring biological processes that result in fine structures and
expand the range of applications for this powerful, in vivo, non-invasive and translational imaging modality in
preclinical applications. The PET scanner developed in this proposal is also MRI-compatible and will support
eventual integration inside an MRI scanner for hybrid PET/MRI imaging."

 Complex biophysical cellular interactions are integral to many hematological processes ranging from platelet
aggregation to leukocyte rolling and extravasation through the endothelium. While molecular biology has led to
the discovery of numerous causative genes and associated biochemical signaling pathways, that is only part of
the picture, analogous to knowing only the actors in a play without knowing the plot. To fully comprehend how
these cellular machines in our blood work in concert in the dynamic environment of the circulation and how these
physical interactions go awry during disease states requires physical tools that operate at the cellular and
subcellular scales. With my background as a “physician-scientist-engineer” trained in clinical hematology and
bioengineering with specific focuses in micro/nanosystems technologies, microfluidics, and cellular mechanics,
my laboratory has steadily merged these fields together to develop tools to answer biophysical hematologic
questions that were previously technologically infeasible, which we then immediately translate to my patients'
bedsides. With specific focuses on hematologic processes and diseases such as hemostasis, thrombosis and
sickle cell disease, our laboratory has leveraged our unique combined clinical and engineering expertise to invent
groundbreaking microtechnologies that either function as in vitro models of hematologic processes and disease
that are more physiologically relevant than current systems or enable answering specific biophysical questions
in hematology that current systems are incapable of. More specifically, we have developed: 1) “organ-on-chip”
technologies to enable vascularized microfluidic models of the microvasculature that function as physiologically
relevant models of hemostasis, thrombosis, and sickle cell disease pathophysiology and 2) microengineered
platforms to study the cellular mechanics of how platelets respond to their biophysical microenvironment.
Collectively, our microtechnologies have not only led to groundbreaking research that have addressed questions
in hematology that were not answerable with current assays, but also serve as drug discovery platforms,
precursor technologies for novel diagnostic devices, and even paradigm-shifting drug delivery strategies. Moving
forward, our research program progresses both in terms of technology development and application thereof,
from asking basic impactful questions as well as translation towards the patient. Examples of the former involve
incorporating more complex microengineered features into our microfluidics, such as mechanical components
and novel biomaterials, to enable an “endothelialized” bleeding model to study all of the principal components of
hemostasis in vitro and a collagen hydrogel-based microvasculature-on-a-chip to investigate how cell-cell
interactions in sickle cell disease causes endothelial dysfunction, respectively. On the other hand, we are also
now applying our existing microtechnologies as biophysical biomarkers of hematologic diseases such as immune
thrombocytopenia. Overall, our laboratory's unique “basement-to-bench-to-bedside” approach will not only will
impact hematology research, but most importantly, improve the lives of my patients."
10772021,"Project Summary/Abstract
Myeloid malignancies are a group of often lethal cancers that derive from cells of the myeloid lineage of the
hematopoietic system and include acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and diverse myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), the latter of which include chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) and primary myelofibrosis. AML, the most common acute leukemia in adults, is responsible for
significant cancer-related mortality, with a five-year survival rate of 28.9%. Although recent advances in
genomics and other areas have significantly improved our understanding of the molecular events that underlie
AML pathogenesis, these advances have yet to translate to significant improvements in the overall outcomes
of patients with the disease, which have remained relatively unchanged over the last 40 years.
In notable contrast to the scenario for AML, outcomes in patients diagnosed with a different leukemia, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), have been transformed in recent decades by drugs that target proteins such as
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), PI3Kd, and CD20, whose expression and function are unique to the B cell
lineage from which these cancers arise. These agents, which exhibit narrow side effect profiles, can thus be
used chronically, alone or in combination with one another or additional agents to yield very long term disease
control. Similar advances in the targeting of proteins with lineage-specific expression profiles and
dependencies have led to substantial improvements in the treatment of patients with breast, prostate, and
neural crest-derived tumors.
Recently, we discovered that the PI3Kg holoenzyme, comprised of the catalytic p110g and regulatory p101
subunits, is a profound regulator of AKT signaling, survival, and chemosensitivity in AML whose expression is
restricted to hematopoietic cells, and particularly those of the myeloid lineage. Thus, targeting this critical
signaling node leads to marked antitumor effects in AML cell lines, patient-derived cultures, and PDX models
without the systemic toxicities historically associated with pan- or a/b isoform-specific PI3K inhibition. In this
proposal, we describe studies to comprehensively characterize the expression and function of PI3Kg across all
major AML subtypes as well the normal cell types of the hematopoietic system. Further, we propose to define
the fundamental mechanisms governing PI3Kg expression in AML, then evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and
safety of targeting this signaling axis in gold standard xenograft, humanized mouse, and genetically
engineered mouse models of AML. Together, these studies will define a novel, lineage-restricted signaling axis
regulating survival in myeloid malignancies whose selective targeting may add substantially to the therapeutic
armamentarium in AML."

Syphilis has been a scourge for thousands of years. It has been impossible to eradicate due to biological and
societal barriers. Despite curative therapy and public health work, incidence is rising in underrepresented
minorities, men who have sex with men, women, and children. An effective syphilis vaccine will be a key tool
for control and eradication. During infection, Treponema pallidum (Tp) bacteria are largely cleared from primary
and then secondary infectious lesions by immune mechanisms, including antibody-mediated phagocytosis by
IFNγ-activated tissue macrophages. Prior efforts to create a syphilis vaccine focused on antibodies against
rare outer membrane proteins. These only generate partial protection in rabbits and have not advanced to
human trials. Notably, these candidates did not specifically target T-cell responses. The premise of this K08
application is that inclusion of T cell antigens will drive effective antibody responses and macrophage
activation, and should be a goal for vaccine design. We hypothesize that there are population prevalent Tp T
cell antigens. Prior to my work, there are no reported human Tp T cell antigens with epitope validation. Aim 1
focuses on acquired immunity, including identification of dominant/prevalent CD4 T cell antigens. I will use a
suite of methods established in my mentor’s lab to detect, enrich, and expand Tp-specific CD4 T cells from
blood. We have also shown that Tp-specific CD4 T cells are naturally enriched in situ in small biopsies of
secondary syphilis lesions. My established IRB protocols and subject referral pathways have allowed me to
demonstrate that Tp-specific T cells remain in skin for at least 6 months after therapy. CD4 T cells from blood
and biopsies will be screened with a large panel of rationally chosen recombinant Tp proteins and T cell
reactivity thoroughly validated. Syphilis lesions are rich in B cells that secrete antibodies (plasma cells, PC).
Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that lesion PC secrete Tp-specific IgG. While Tp is canonically an
extracellular pathogen, not expected to elicit peptide-specific CD8 T cells, abundant CD8α-expressing cells do
occur in lesions. If Aim 2 confirms the presence of CD8αβ T cells with hypervariable T cell receptors in lesions,
Aim 1 will examine their fine specificity for potential vaccine use. Aim 2 focuses on the innate immune
response to Tp in active and healed syphilis lesions. Immunohistochemistry and single cell RNAseq will
examine the hypothesis that parenchymal dermal cells express interferon and ISG genes in syphilis rashes,
and that innate leukocytes are also involved in the inflammatory reaction. Aim 2 Approaches will also yield IgG
and CD4 T cell TCR sequences suitable for synthetic reconstruction of antibodies and TCR-bearing reporter
cells, cutting-edge technologies in use in my mentors’ labs, to further address Aim 1 acquired immunity
hypotheses. Overall, knowledge of Tp T cell antigens will significantly improve our ability to design next-
generation candidate vaccines against syphilis."
10784648,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Incidence of autoimmune encephalitis exceeds that of infectious cause, but 50% percent (half of approximate
4000/year in the US) are IgG biomarker negative. Seronegativity hinders diagnosis and pathophysiologic
understanding in autoimmune encephalopathies (encephalitis, cerebellar ataxias and other movement
disorders). Novel IgG characterization, which attempts to address this gap, is linear and slow occurring at a
rate of 1-2 year (using standard tissue-based immunofluorescence assay [IFA] followed by western blots,
immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry). The long-term goal is to molecularly, clinically and
mechanistically characterize autoimmune encephalopathies, and develop targeted autoimmune therapies. The
overall objectives in this application, are to: 1) identify disease-specific biomarkers for seronegative
autoimmune encephalopathies; 2) molecularly validate novel biomarkers, and 3) clinically, radiologically and
immunologically deep-phenotype autoimmune encephalopathies. The central hypothesis is that seronegative
autoimmune encephalopathies are characterizable though biomarker discovery. The rationale for this project is
that biomarker discovery and translation could occur expeditiously, by leveraging complementary techniques in
parallel, that novel biomarkers could be molecularly validated, and that disorders associated with new
biomarkers could be neurologically and immunologically deep-phenotyped. To test the central hypothesis the
following three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Identify novel biomarkers, initially in 3 partly characterized
seronegative autoimmune encephalopathies; 2) determine validity of novel biomarkers; and 3) assess for
differentiated clinical phenotypes, and cytokine profile accompaniments. Under the first aim, serum and CSF
from seronegative autoimmune encephalopathy patients will be interrogated for neural antibodies using native
full-length protein microarrays, as principle technique, complemented by tissue and cell-based IFA for initial
IgG screening, and, as needed, phage immunoprecipitation sequencing, and mass spectrometry techniques
for verification. For the second aim, newly characterized IgGs will be validated in autoimmune encephalopathy
patients and controls by multiple antigen-specific methods (confocal indirect immunofluorescence, and
recombinant protein assays [western blot, cDNA-transfected cell-based]). For the third aim, patients with
autoimmune encephalopathies with characterized and validated neural IgGs will be deep-phenotyped clinically,
radiologically and immunologically, by evaluating for IgG effects in live neuron assays, and cytokine-chemokine
profiles. Remaining seronegative cohorts will be immunologically profiled by cytokine-chemokine assays. The
research proposed is innovative in the applicant’s opinion, as it focuses on multiplexed biomarker identification,
validation, and deep phenotyping. The proposed research is significant because disease-specific biomarkers,
with in-depth characterization, allow earlier diagnosis and treatment, and support disease mechanism studies."
10908722,"ELEVATE CENTER COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the ELEVATE Center is to Expand our reach across Utah and the Intermountain West,
LEVerage existing infrastructure, And Treat pregnant and postpartum people with substance use disorder
(SUD) who experience disparities to achieve Equity. We have intentionally positioned achieving equity as a key
outcome of the ELEVATE Center’s mission and recognize this requires an approach that upends traditional
research structures, radically altering the parameters of community engagement and partnership.
When working with historically and structurally marginalized people, research efforts are most successful when
investigators collaborate with community partners and people with lived experience from the outset. This is
particularly critical when working with communities with intersecting identities. Pregnant and postpartum people
with SUD, particularly Native mothers or those in rural areas, experience numerous structural barriers to health
and are the focus of the ELEVATE Center’s projects. Explicitly sharing authority over the direction and
interpretation of the Center’s research efforts engenders trust, thus amplifying the reach and impact of results.
ELEVATE Center investigators are engaged in long-standing community partnerships that center communities
and people with lived experience. These long-standing community partnerships create the foundation for the
ELEVATE Center’s Community Engagement Integration Core and the Community Advisory Board (CAB)
embedded within the Core. Our strong partnerships provide a springboard for realizing our long-term goal of
conducting community-integrated research that amplifies community wisdom and leadership to eliminate
inequities in maternal morbidity and mortality in Utah. The Community Engagement Integration Core will
support the ELEVATE Center’s objectives by providing a central, responsive infrastructure that cultivates
community partnerships predicated on equitable leadership, community wisdom, and resilience. Our aims are
to: (1) develop structures that amplify and coordinate community voices to create equitable leadership in the
efforts of the ELEVATE Center; (2) accelerate the maturation of networks between and across the ELEVATE
Center’s community partners to facilitate innovative implementation of research and training efforts; and (3)
build robust dissemination pathways and sustainability structures on the scaffold of the ELEVATE Community
Engagement Integration Core’s infrastructure.
Regular CAB and Community Engagement Integration Core meetings, virtual connection resources,
coordinated trainee and participant recruitment, and capacity building trainings will ensure ongoing
collaborative work across all participating Center investigators and our community partners. The ELEVATE
Center’s Community Engagement Integration Core will centralize infrastructure, provide avenues for
bidirectional knowledge exchange and community leadership, and amplify dissemination efforts. Collectively,
these actions will maximally and sustainably reduce maternal morbidity and mortality from SUD in Utah."
10908725,"ELEVATE Training Integration Core Abstract
Substance use disorder (SUD) is by far the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death in our community,
and it disproportionately affects American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) and rural populations. Successful
response to this maternal death crisis demands community partnerships and transdisciplinary collaborations in
both clinical and research efforts. To achieve this paradigm shift, early-stage investigators (ESIs) from diverse
backgrounds must be trained to recognize SUD as a condition that lies at the intersection of bio-behavioral,
sociopolitical, and public health factors. We use an expansive definition of ESI to include investigators along
career pathways from students to junior faculty. The ELEVATE Training Integration Core will use a
combination of academic institutional resources and community partnerships to create opportunities for ESIs.
This diverse group of trainees will serve as a pool for our Training Program capstone: the ELEVATE scholar, a
mentored faculty research position with 75% FTE support from the University of Utah (U of U) Vice-President
for Research. The U of U academic resources include formalized research training opportunities available
through the Substance Use & Pregnancy – Recovery, Addiction, Dependence (SUPeRAD) Clinic; the Vice
President’s Clinical and Translational Research Scholar Program (VPCAT), the Program for Addiction
Research, Clinical Care, Knowledge and Advocacy (PARCKA); and Utah Center for Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI). The community partnerships include Utah Support Advocates for Recovery
Awareness (USARA) and collaborators from the Sacred Circle Clinic. Consistent with the ELEVATE Center’s
focus on dissemination and implementation science, the Center supported ELEVATE Scholar will enroll in the
Mountain States Community-Engaged Dissemination and Implementation Science Training Institute. All
ELEVATE Center investigators will serve as research mentors. David Turok, MD will lead the Program,
working in collaboration with Jasmin E. Charles, PA-C, co-founder and clinical director of SUPeRAD who will
coordinate research opportunities for ESIs across all Center projects. The ELEVATE research projects provide
a foundation and focus for aspiring researchers to 1) support the development of a culturally-integrated
perinatal SUD intervention for urban Native mothers by adapting the successful SUPeRAD model, 2) help
develop and execute a training package to mitigate bias and stigma against individuals with SUD, and 3) to
conduct and evaluate informant interviews in collaboration with the Utah Maternal Mortality Review Committee
in order to understand the family, systems and community-level contributors and the role of discrimination in
pregnancy related death. The ELEVATE Training Integration Core will grow a cadre of future leaders in Utah
with the skillsets needed to identify and investigate the most functional solutions to the complicated problems
around maternal SUD, as well as to disseminate these findings broadly."
10764287,"ABSTRACT: Currently BCG is the most widely administered vaccine worldwide against
tuberculosis (TB). Yet, TB remains one of the most common causes of death from an infectious
disease globally underscoring its limited efficacy. We have shown that BCG’s vaccine efficacy
can be improved if administered by a different route or dose. In fact, intravenous BCG
vaccination resulted in 90% protection in a non-human primate model of TB but this method is
impractical to conduct on a population scale. Features associated with protection include the
presence of CD8 and CD4 T cells in the airways and lung resident T cells. In this proposal we
plan to mimic this immune response and improve upon the existing BCG vaccine in a strategy
that we call “enhanced prime and pull”. We propose to use N-803, an IL-15 agonist, to enhance
the frequency of innate CD8 cells and boost the effects of high dose, intradermal BCG. This is
followed by a dose of aerosolized BCG to pull vaccine-induced immune cells into the areas and
propagate resident T cells in the lungs. Using an animal model that recapitulates human TB, we
will utilized state-of-the-art modern tools such as PET CT, large scale immunologic profiling both
at a transcriptional and flow cytometric level and machine learning techniques. Immunogenicity
in blood and airway immune cells will examined among vaccine and control groups prior to
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Aim 1). After infection, we will then compare the
ability of the vaccine regimen to prevent infection and/or lower bacterial burden compared to
controls (Aim 2). We will examine the immune responses (including the presence of tissue
resident T cells) in the granuloma, lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes in the context of
bacterial burden among vaccinated and control groups. Lastly, machine learning techniques will
be used to identify immune parameters that correlate with protection in the context of
vaccines. The proposed studies are likely to reveal important information about the role of
innate cytotoxic CD8 cell and their role in vaccine induced protection and mechanisms of
recruiting mucosal immune responses. We may also gain important insights into key surrogate
markers of protection sorely needed in the TB field."

therapeutic applications. Recent preliminary studies showed that conditional LSD1 deletion in the tongue
epithelium during dysplasia reduced invasive pathological lesions, downregulated EGFR, YAP-induced signaling
network, and Pd-L1 expression. Next, the topical application of LSD1 inhibitor during dysplasia prevented its
progression to invasive phenotype, attenuated pathological lesions, expression of Hippo signaling effectors (Yap,
Taz, Ccn2,) and immune checkpoints (Pd-1, and Pd-l1). LSD1 inhibitor sensitized OSCC to combinations with
either YAP inhibitor, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, limiting tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we showed
for the first time that blocking LSD1 inhibits preneoplasia, a feed-forward loop during the progression of
dysplasia to OSCC. Interestingly, LSD1 inhibition attenuates IL-6-JAK-STAT3 novel signaling identified in two
independent studies 1) proteomics analysis of LSD knockout mice preneoplasia and 2) single-cell RNAseq
analysis using LSD1 inhibitor. However, the mechanism of LSD1 function, its target cells in progressive oral
malignancy, and how LSD1 promotes IL-6-JAK-STAT3 remain unclear. This knowledge gap prevents the
targeted design of effective new epigenetic therapeutic strategies for OSCC. We hypothesize that (1) LSD1
upregulation during dysplasia reprograms oral tissue to invasive phenotype by acting on IL6 -signaling and
induced cell types and (2) pharmacological attenuation of LSD1 reset epigenome to reverse progressive
malignant preneoplasia to a noninvasive phenotype. Using clinically relevant animal models, this project is well-
positioned to address the following Specific Aims: 1) to determine how upregulated LSD1 epigenetically
reprogram dysplasia to promote IL6 network during progressive oral preneoplasia invasive phenotype; 2) to
determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6-JAK-STAT3 network induced invasive phenotype in
preneoplasia, and 3) to determine the translational importance of pharmacological LSD1 inhibition reverse
preneoplasia by inhibiting IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling induced cancer stem and immune cells. The successful
completion of the proposed project is expected to identify LSD1 and therapeutic application mechanisms in the
IL6-JAK-STAT3 network, related stem cells, and immune cells. Finally, the study will determine if LSD1 a role
in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance and pharmacological LSD1 inhibition can attenuate feline OSCC for a
potential application in veterinary and human medicine. Overall, the study will have a broader impact on future
translational studies in human preneoplasia."

DNA damage-mediated genome instability is a contributing factor in the causation of human diseases, including
neurodegeneration, immunological disorders, and cancer. Understanding how cells prevent and manage DNA
damage is highly significant. R loop, a transcription-linked 3 nucleic-acid structure consisting of a RNA:DNA
hybrid and a displaced single-strand DNA (ssDNA), when decorated with histone H3S10p mark causes genomic
instability upon its cleavage into DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Currently, nothing is known about R loop
dysfunction in the causation of human primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDDs), aka, inborn errors of
immunity. Using a PID disease model of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), we recently discovered an
essential nuclear role of WASp, the protein deficient in WAS, in limiting R loop-mediated DNA damage in CD4+
T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes. This discovery has opened up a new avenue of research into how WASp, a
nucleocytoplasmic protein with dual-roles in F-actin polymerization and gene transcription, ensures R loop-linked
genome stability. The current proposal seeks to define the nuclear signaling pathways and mechanisms involved
in ensuring a healthy R loop balance, and therefore a stable genome, in human Th cells, and how their
disruptions by WAS gene mutations is causally-linked to the development of immune deficiency and clinical
phenotypes in WAS. Aim 1 focuses on defining chromatin-based mechanisms by which WASp influences the
balance between beneficial (“good”) R loops and deleterious (“bad”) R loops, and their effects in the causation
of WAS Th1 and WAS Th2 cellular phenotypes. Aim 2 will clarify the mechanism of the newly identified mRNA
splicing defect in WAS Th cells as it relates to R loop formation and genome instability. Aim 3 will utilize primary
T cells from multiple WAS patients of differing clinical severities to establish R loop load in the T cells as a
“dynamic” disease biomarker, and to define the involvement of nuclear-F-actin effects of WASp in WAS
phenotype development. In the long-term, the knowledge gained from these studies will foster the development
of novel prognostics, diagnostics, and therapeutics for this PID and other R loop-mediated immunological
disorders."
10764290,"Complex neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among others,
impose an enormous socioeconomic burden on families and on society. The pathobiological mechanisms are
largely unknown, and treatment options are limited and often incompletely effective. During the past decade,
advances in human genetics and next-generation sequencing, coupled with expanding cohort sizes, have
permitted the identification of thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for neuropsychiatric diseases.
Each disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could provide insights
into a biological mechanism that underlies the risk of disease in humans. However, the availability of data is not
synonymous with the presence of meaning. The challenge researchers are facing now is the derivation of
biological meaning post-GWAS. Particularly, more than 90% of the risk variants are found in the non-coding
regions of the human genome. Although the potential contribution of non-coding variants to complex human
diseases has long been speculated, it has been a major challenge to develop testable hypotheses to decipher
their role in disease etiology. Here, we propose to develop innovative multidisciplinary approaches to bridge the
gap between human genetics and experimental biology. The major hypothesis underlying the approach is that
epigenetic changes caused by non-coding variation in the cis-regulatory elements, particularly enhancers that
are platforms for sequence-specific transcription factor binding and can influence gene transcription over long
distance, may confer disease liability by disrupting gene expression. We aim to (i) annotate functionally distinct
enhancers in disease-relevant human neuronal subtypes generated by reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells,
(ii) apply the cutting-edge HiChIP technology to profile the promoter-enhancer interactions in neurons in resting
and active states, and identify the target genes of enhancers, finally, (iii) we will determine how disease-
associated variants affect enhancer activity in human neurons. Such effort will provide the foundation to map
and prioritize non-coding risk variants for future mechanistic studies. Especially, the enhancer-interactome
analysis performed in this study will provide a physical-interaction-based approach for the identification of
enhancer target genes in neurons. The information will lay the groundwork for developing testable hypotheses
to elucidate the molecular impact of risk variants in non-coding regions. Last but not least, determining how non-
coding risk variants disrupt activity-regulated gene expression in neuronal subtypes may uncover novel disease-
relevant biology not observed using the incomplete existing methodologies and resources (activity-responsive
enhancers are not possible to identify from post-mortem tissue). Once accomplished, the proposed work will
have broad impact on translating genetic discoveries into actionable biological hypotheses that can potentially
power a new round of development of novel therapeutics strategies for complex neuropsychiatric disorders."
10764292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social play is a highly rewarding behavior and important for social skill development as has been demonstrated
for human children and juvenile rats. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit social play deficits,
which contributes to their lifelong social dysfunction. ASD is more prevalent in males than in females, suggest-
ing sex differences in the etiology of ASD. Developing effective means to restore social play in children with
ASD will improve their lifelong social functioning, but this requires better understanding of the neural basis of
social play and potential sex differences herein. Social deficits in ASD are associated with changes in the oxy-
tocin (OXT) system and in the brain reward system, with both systems being critical for normal social function-
ing. Furthermore, the OXT system is a potential drug target to improve social functioning in ASD patients.
However, virtually nothing is known about OXT's role in social play. Our proposed research in rats aims to ad-
vance understanding of the neural pathways by which OXT regulates social play in males and females. This is
a first essential step to help inform sex-specific therapeutic strategies to effectively improve social play in chil-
dren with ASD. Our central hypothesis is that OXT modulates the activity of reward-associated brain regions to
regulate social play behavior in sex-specific ways. Specifically, we propose a role for paraventricular nucleus
(PVN)-derived OXT in regulating social play by modulating the activity of OXT receptor (OXTR)-expressing
neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that project to the ventral pallidum (VP). We further propose that this
pathway is recruited sex-specifically. Based on strong preliminary data, we will test our novel concept that the
PVNOXT→NAcOXTR→VP pathway mediates the sex-specific regulation of social play: In Aim 1, we will test the
hypothesis that the PVNOXT→NAc pathway regulates social play and does so sex-specifically; In Aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that the NAcOXTR→VP pathway regulates social play and does so sex-specifically; In Aim 3,
we will test the hypothesis that the same NAcOXTR neuron population that receives PVNOXT input projects to the
VP and is sex-specifically activated during social play. These proposed studies will reveal a new neural circuit
spanning 3 brain regions (PVN→NAc→VP) that sex-specifically modulates social play. Using newly developed
genetic tools, namely an Oxtr-iCre rat line, we will be the first to examine the neural pathways by which OXT
signaling regulates any behavior in rats. Our findings will significantly advance the field by providing the first
evidence for the sex-specific involvement of the OXT system in regulating social play. Outcomes will help in-
form the role of OXT in typical and atypical social play in human children, and will provide mechanistic insights
into why ASD is more prevalent in males than in females."
10884215,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor. Surgical resection is difficult
because these tumors are in delicate midbrain/brainstem locations and infiltrate into critical structures. Despite
decades of clinical trials, H3K27M-mutant DMG is considered uniformly fatal, with a median overall survival of
9-11 months. Radiation therapy, which itself is highly toxic to the developing pediatric brain, extends survival by
2-3 months. Therefore, the development of safe and effective therapies for DMG is of utmost importance.
I propose to evaluate the effect of inhibiting MALT1 on the pathogenesis of H3K27M-mutant DMG. MALT1 is the
effector molecule of the CARMA/CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, a cytoplasmic protein complex that
drives downstream pro-survival NF-kB transcriptional activity. MALT1 possesses both scaffolding and protease
activities. Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that MALT1 protease activity promotes cancer cell
viability, proliferation, and migration/invasion in multiple cancer types. In addition to its role within cancer cells,
MALT1 is also a critical regulator of immune cell responses, and our laboratory is investigating the impact of
MALT1 protease in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of high-grade glioma. Based on my preliminary data, I
hypothesize that inhibiting MALT1 proteolytic activity could provide dual benefit in H3K27M-mutant DMG, both
via the direct effects of inhibiting MALT1 within the cancer cells and via the effects of inhibiting MALT1 protease
within immune cells of the TME to promote anti-tumor immune activation.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will evaluate the influence of MALT1 protease activity on the H3K27M-mutant DMG
TME. Experimental techniques utilized in this aim will include use of murine models, single cell RNA sequencing,
and multispectral immunofluorescence. In Aim 2 of this proposal, we will evaluate the impact of MALT1 protease
inhibition on malignant features of H3K27M-mutant DMG cells, using a series of in vitro analyses. Finally, in Aim
3, we will analyze the impact of MALT1 protease inhibition, with or without radiation, in our orthotopic/syngeneic
H3K27M-mutant DMG model.
Overall, this project evaluates inhibition of MALT1 protease as a potential therapeutic approach for H3K27M-
mutant DMG. Completion of this proposal will provide me with exceptional research training by an outstanding
team of scientists and physician-scientists. This training experience will prepare me for a career as a physician-
scientist who studies the molecular underpinnings of pediatric cancers to develop new and improved treatments."
10926826,"Project Summary
Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide and the second leading cause of death for adolescents in the
US. Despite advances in understanding of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and their treatment, the suicide rate
has not decreased. One possible factor limiting progress in this area has been a lack of focus on
understanding (and targeting) developmental mechanisms that may give rise to suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Interoception, the perception of internal bodily states, holds promise as a novel factor that may
increase risk for suicide. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors center around inflicting harm to the body, yet
surprisingly little work has tested whether and how disrupted interoceptive processes may contribute to risk for
suicide. Given the centrality of the body in suicidal thoughts and behaviors and the unique interoceptive
learning and processing that may occur during adolescence, altered interoceptive processing represents a
novel risk factor that may advance understanding of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adolescents. This
proposal tests the associations between interoceptive processes and the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Eighty adolescents with and without suicidal thoughts and behaviors will undergo assessments of
suicidal thoughts and behaviors, psychophysiological measurement of interoceptive processes, exposure to
childhood trauma, and ecological momentary assessments of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and appraisals
of body sensations. Aim 1 of this proposal is to test the association between perceptual interoceptive
processes (i.e., interoceptive accuracy, sensitivity, and attention) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Aim 2 of
this proposal is to test the association between appraisals and descriptions of body sensations and suicidal
thoughts and behaviors. Aim 3 of this proposal is to test whether interoceptive processes are a potential
mediator of the associations between childhood trauma and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The proposed
study’s greatest potential impacts are to use innovative strategies to study a novel potential risk factor for
suicidal thoughts and behaviors, identify putative pathways that have clear translational value, and to
potentially identify novel targets for intervention to treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents."

Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary vasoconstriction and
vascular remodeling. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have defined associations between single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PAH. For example, non-coding SNP rs2856830, in proximity to HLA-
DPA1, is linked to increased PAH risk and survival. Yet, such “tag” SNPs may not be responsible for disease
association, because they are often in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with neighboring true “functional” SNPs
(fSNPs) that drive disease. We showed that SNP rs2856830 is in LD with fSNP rs9277336, which has enhancer
activity and binds a transcription factor, ACTN4, with allele-specificity. The rs9277336 (G) allele is associated
with increased PAH severity. fSNP rs9277336 regulates HLA-DPA1 via allele-specific binding of ACTN4 and
comes into contact with a distal gene target, ATF6B. Thus, I hypothesize that the rs9277336 (G) allele
controls endothelial dysfunction and PAH through reduced allele-specific binding of ACTN4, thus
disrupting the regulation of HLA-DPA1 and ATF6B via proximal and distal chromatin interactions. This
hypothesis will be tested with the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine if SNP rs9277336 (G) allele displays
reduced binding to ACTN4. With oligonucleotides exposed to pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) nuclear
cell extracts ex vivo, the rs9277336 (G) allele exhibited lower binding to ACTN4 than (A). Here, I will perform the
more definitive experiment to determine if ACTN4 shows such allele-specific binding to the rs9277336 (G) vs (A)
allele in intact cells, primarily using isogenic inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-EC)
that carry single SNP nucleotide edits. (2) Determine if ACTN4 binding to SNP rs9277336 regulates HLA-
DPA1 expression. We found that loss- and gain-of-function of ACTN4 reciprocally regulated expression of HLA-
DPA1 in PAECs. ACTN4 or HLA-DPA1 deficiency mediated angiogenesis and PAEC migration. I will assess
whether reduced ACTN4 binding to the rs9277336 (G) allele regulates and depends upon HLA-DPA1 levels to
control function in iPSC-ECs, thus proving the pathogenic action of the (G) allele. (3) Determine if ATF6B
controls pathologic endothelial function in PAH. Based on existing Hi-C chromatin contact maps, we found
evidence that ACTN4 binding to rs9277336 may regulate ATF6B via long-range interaction. ATF6B is an isoform
of ATF6, a known mediator of PAH. I will perform chromatin confirmation capture (3C) to determine if rs9277336
physically contacts the ATF6B gene. I will also assess if ATF6B loss- and gain-of-function disrupts PAEC
function, thus establishing a paradigm by which rs9277336 distally interacts with ATF6B and mediates pathologic
endothelial function, in addition to its effects on HLA-DPA1. Significance: Since the risk (G) allele is significantly
enriched in the population (MAF=0.852), proof of this SNP’s pathogenic activity would define why a significant
proportion of persons are at risk for more severe PAH. Such insight would have substantial impact on better
PAH diagnostics and therapeutics, thus preparing me for a long career as a physician-scientist."
10912497,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This grant application is for the F31-Diversity support of Courtney Swain during her MD-PhD training. The
research focus of this proposal is to establish a mechanism in which hyperglycemia and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
conspire to modulate CD8+ T cell exhaustion and regulatory T cell (Treg) immunosuppression in triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Breast cancer continues to threaten the lives of many women in the U.S. and worldwide
as it accounts for more than 30% of all female cancer cases. Additionally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a
highly prevalent morbidity and about a quarter of breast cancer patients are diabetic, which can increase
treatment complications and limit therapy options. TNBC tumors are immunologically “cold,” characterized by
the limited infiltration of cytotoxic populations and increased abundance of immunosuppressive constituents in
the primary tumor. Hyperglycemia in T2D pathogenesis has been implicated to impair CD8+ T cells, lymphocytes
critical in tumor killing and immunotherapy response, and their exhaustion process. Upon tumor challenge,
subsets of immunologically reactive TCF1+ stem-like and TCF1- transitory effector CD8+ T cells are generated.
These CD8+ T cell subsets have been found to be highly essential in tumor control despite their phenotype and
nomenclature of early exhaustion. Notably, hyperglycemia exacerbates dysregulated Hh signaling in breast
cancer. Initial investigations have revealed that hyperglycemia and Hh signaling may be cooperatively driving
dysfunctional CD8+ T cell exhaustion in the mammary tumor milieu. Additionally, the presence of Tregs during
mammary tumorigenesis correlates with poorer prognoses in TNBC. Supporting evidence in this proposal
underscores that both, Hh signaling and hyperglycemia, impair CD8+ T cell exhaustion and promote Treg
immunosuppression. However, the mechanisms by which these factors influence these key T cell populations
are unknown. Therefore, this proposal will apply unique model systems of Hh signaling and hyperglycemia to
delineate their roles in CD8+ T cell and Treg activity in TNBC. Findings will provide more relevance for
combination TNBC therapies, especially for the distinct patient population of diabetic breast cancer patients.
The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by her PhD mentor, Dr. Lalita Shevde-Samant. The goals of
the training plan are to provide the PI with: (i) a rigorous research project using distinctive pre-clinical models of
diabetes-associated breast cancer, novel genetically engineered mice, and tumor-immune crosstalk; (ii)
opportunities in developing immunologic and bioinformatic techniques and in expanding training in responsible
conduct of research, rigor, reproducibility, and principles of scientific integrity; and (iii) a scientifically enriching
and equipped environment essential for developing a successful career as an oncologist-scientist. Given this
project’s focus on the interaction of two major disease challenges of the U.S., breast cancer and diabetes, the
PI will have exemplary guidance and a solid foundation to develop into a very competent physician-scientist."
10748415,"Summary
 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Prolonged psychosocial stress is a
significant predictor of disease incidence and severity. However, the specific neural mechanisms that
contribute to the cardiovascular consequences of stress are largely unknown. Therefore, the current proposal
will explore how the cortical circuits responsible for cognitive appraisal of stress inhibit physiological stress
responses. Recent studies in rats identified a population of cells in the infralimbic (IL) region of the medial
prefrontal cortex that reduce endocrine and autonomic responses to chronic stress. Further, knockdown of
glutamate release from IL neurons leads to vascular dysfunction after chronic stress. While the activity of
excitatory IL projection neurons is critical for preventing the deleterious effects of chronic stress, the pathways
used by these cells to limit reactivity of autonomic and endocrine effectors remain to be determined.
Preliminary data indicate that the IL projects to catecholaminergic (epinephrine/norepinephrine producing)
neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM), the primary site of sympathetic activation. These excitatory IL
projections also target inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic neurons within the VLM, leading to the hypothesis
that IL glutamatergic signaling to the VLM limits cardiovascular and endocrine stress reactivity and the
consequences of chronic stress on vascular stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy. This hypothesis will be tested
by optogenetic activation of IL synapses in the VLM during stress exposure in male and female rats. This
approach will be employed in animals that have been previously exposed to chronic variable stress or
remained as unstressed controls. Cardiovascular telemetry will be used to measure heart rate, blood pressure,
and sympathetic activity. A separate aim will examine neuroendocrine stress responses of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis. To determine how IL inputs to the VLM impact pathological responses to chronic stress,
a combinatorial viral approach will be used to retrogradely silence the IL-VLM circuit with Cre-dependent
tetanus toxin. Vascular stiffness, cardiac hypertrophy, and endothelial function will be assessed in male and
female rats exposed to chronic stress. This circuit silencing approach will also be used to examine the
importance of IL signaling for preventing chronic stress effects on the expression of cellular signaling genes in
the VLM. Collectively, these experiments will determine specific circuit and cellular pathways linking cognitive
appraisal and physiological stress responses. Further, this connection represents a critical biological process
that could be harnessed to intervene in the cardiovascular consequences of chronic stress."
10748419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
When a mosquito-borne flavivirus encounters a cell, it must adhere to a receptor on the cell surface, endocytose,
and finally fuse with the endosomal membrane. To accomplish this, flaviviruses use an exterior lattice of 180 E
proteins arrayed in a herringbone arrangement of 90 antiparallel dimers at neutral pH. Acidification in the late
endosome induces a widespread conformational rearrangement, resulting in 60 outward-facing trimeric E spikes
that can embed into the host membrane and pull the membranes together, fusing them and releasing the viral
RNA into the host cytoplasm. Although flavivirus lattices are canonically described as 90 dimers lying flat (mature
state) or 60 trimers facing outward (immature and fusion states), up to 50% of Dengue virions have incomplete
maturation that results in a mosaic pattern of E dimers and trimers with different orientations. It is unknown
whether mosaic lattices are less functional than their perfect counterparts due to steric hindrance of the
conformational rearrangements, or alternatively might have certain advantages that explain why evolution has
conserved their heterogeneous arrangement. This has strong consequences for the design of therapeutics, as
the mature and immature patches have different epitope exposure and possibly different binding affinities for
antibodies that are not well understood.
We will explore this question through a combination of structural and functional studies performed on mosaic
Dengue and West Nile viruses, using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the
position and orientation of individual E proteins within the viral lattices, and designing new analyses to describe
the heterogeneity of the viral population. We will evaluate how the mosaic surface affects fusion and antibody
binding, and directly visualize the structure-function relationship by imaging viruses interacting with target
membranes and cells. This approach will allow us to identify which areas of a mosaic lattice participate in
adhesion or fusion, and whether functional virions favor more heterogeneous or homogeneous surfaces. Current
structural biology is usually performed on samples that contain a large number of inactive virions; by imaging
functional states directly, inactive virions are eliminated from analysis to facilitate identification of the structural
states of the virus that should be prioritized in structure-based therapeutic and vaccine design.
While this work will focus on the flavivirus lattice, functional lattices are ubiquitous in all the domains of life and
play integral roles in human health and disease. The methods and analyses we develop to study flaviviruses will
directly apply to other viruses, but will also potentially aid in understanding processes as diverse as bacterial
chemotaxis, carbon fixation, and human cardiac muscle contraction."

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) affects 50,000 people per year in the U.S., causing significant
morbidity and mortality. Patients with aSAH are at risk of developing secondary complications such as
vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Despite adequate surgical treatment of aneurysmal rupture
and aggressive medical management, few effective treatments exist to prevent DCI and late complications
after aSAH. Furthermore, patients with aSAH are susceptible to systemic complications involving numerous
organ systems including the heart, lungs, and kidneys and are known to have systemic elevations in
proinflammatory cytokines. The purpose of this research proposal is to define the metabolic changes that
occur after aSAH and their relationship to systemic inflammation. Marked metabolic changes occur after brain
injury with a shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis. This increased reliance on glycolytic
metabolism is required for the activation of immune effector cells. My preliminary results show decreased
levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and increased levels of glycolytic metabolites in the plasma
of aSAH patients. Lower levels of fumarate and α-ketoglutarate are associated with worse functional
outcomes. In Aim 1, we will use mass spectrometry to perform target metabolomics on retrospectively
collected plasma samples from patients with aSAH and controls. A metabolic signature after aSAH will be
defined, and bioinformatics methods will be used to investigate which metabolites drive proinflammatory
cytokine production. In Aim 2, peripheral blood monocyte oxidative metabolism will be quantified.
Metabolomics will be performed from prospectively collected monocytes. Peripheral blood monocyte
mitochondrial respiration will be quantified compared with controls and across disease severity. The
relationship between the monocyte intracellular proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative metabolism including
mitochondrial membrane potential will be investigated. The ability of metabolically targeted treatments
(metformin, dimethylfumarate, and glutamine) to bolster oxidative metabolism and decrease monocyte
proinflammatory cytokine production will be investigated. This project will include training for Dr. Gusdon to
further his development as a physician-scientist through a rigorous curriculum developed in the Center for
Clinical and Translational Sciences and School of Biomedical Informatics. This will include dedicated statistical
and bioinformatics training and focused mentorship with experts in translational and basic research. The
project will be performed at the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth- Memorial Hermann Hospital."
10753442,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project examimes the structure, spectroscopy, function, and mechanism of metallproteins that regulate cell
cycle progresion in response to programmatic fluctuations in intracellular zinc concentration. Zinc fluxes have
recently been discovered to be key regulatory events in human physiology, including cortical neuron function,
immune response, fertilization, and insulin secretion. Despite its apparent roles in these profound physiologies,
the biochemistry of zinc action is not well understood. Little is known regarding the inorganic chemistry of
metalloproteins involved in the instructive mechanisms that mediate cellular responses to zinc fluxes, zinc
trafficking pathways, or the role of specific metalloprotein receptors in signaling events. To interpret and
eventually intervene in diseases caused by disruption of such pathways, we must first elucidate the fundamental
molecular mechanisms of zinc-dependent switching events.
While zinc has traditionally been viewed as a static cofactor involved in protein structure and enzyme catalysis,
recent studies support the idea that zinc binding sites in regulatory proteins respond to transient fluctuations in
zinc availability and are switched on and off in ways that regulate key cellular events. We will test the hypothesis
that regulatory zinc fluxes exert instructive control over the mammalian cell cycle through specific, receptor-
mediated processes. This hypothesis is based on multiple lines of evidence, including: (1) data showing
fluctuations zinc distribution at various points in the cell cycle for single cells; (2) live cell imaging demonstrating
the movement of waves of zinc; and (3) physicochemical approaches showing colocalization of zinc with specific
factors. The overarching objective of this proposal is to use biochemical and spectroscopic approaches to
understand how the influx and efflux of zinc exert control over the cell cycle. Chemicals tools to probe and control
the concentration of zinc will be created to further our understanding of zinc physiology. In addition, we will
leverage emerging techniques in X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy, NMR, and mass spectrometry to
understand the chemical environment of zinc and probe the zinc occupancy of zinc-containing proteins that
regulate cell cycle progression. Taken together, the results from these studies will elucidate a robust role for zinc
signaling fluxes during the cell cycle."

 This BRG R01 (PAR-16-242) application aims to greatly improved spatial and temporal resolution:
Penetrating electrical stimulation arrays are a crucial component of basic neuroscience research and human
neuroprosthetics. A challenge with this technology is achieving a highly localized stimulated area of the same
neurons over weeks and months. However, implantation of cortical microelectrodes causes a reactive tissue
response, which results in a degradation of the preferred functional performance over time, thus limiting the
device capabilities. Current electrical stimulation implants are tethered to the skull, which chronically increases
the impact of mechanical mismatch, causes neural degeneration around the implant, increases the chance of
infection, increases the chance of mechanical trauma induced failure as well as shifting of the electrode
position, and increases in electrical impedances from glial scarring. In turn, the electrical stimulation loses its
effectiveness to excite neural tissue, making longevity a challenge. Simply increasing the electrical current to
compensate can lead to permenant damage to the tissue and/or the electrode.
 This proposal proves an innovative strategy that uses leading-edge biocompatible materials to develop
innovative “Wireless Axon” electrodes that are ultra-small and untethered, with bioactive surfaces and
nanostructured materials for enhanced signal transduction to electrically excitable tissue. The project aims to
decouple the mechanical requirements necessary in traditional microstimulation technology and improve
spatial selectivity of activated neurons for stable long-term electrical stimulation. The guiding hypothesis is that
decoupling the mechanical tether will improve tissue integration, while immobilized biomolecules will effectively
intervene with the reactive tissue response as well as improve electrode-neuron signal-coupling and selectivity.
 This project is likely to make significant contributions through developing advanced neural probes for long-
term (permanent), high quality, and selective neural stimulation. These could potentially lead to paradigm shifts
in both neuroscience research and clinical neuroprosthetics and neurostimulation through creating the
capability of activating specific neurons for long periods of time with great precision. Our guiding hypothesis is
that the product of the combined benefit is synergistic and greater than the sum of its parts. The outcomes of
this project are also likely to establish new biologically inspired paradigms for creating long-lasting, high-fidelity
neural interfaces with biomimetic materials as well as new paradigms for longitudinally probing neural circuits,
particularly for the study of learning and plasticity. Several variations of the technology developed in this project
is expected to be compatible with optogenetics. This project would impact both the neuroscience research
community, and clinical scientists (neurosurgeons, neurologists, and patients) that use and benefit from
neuroprosthetic- and neurostimulation-based treatments interventions."
10753445,"Regulation of protein multi-functionality by 3′UTRs
SUMMARY
Many protein functions are mediated by protein complexes whose formation is often regulated by abundance
as higher levels increase the chance to encounter an interaction partner. mRNAs contain a coding region that
is translated into protein, but they also contain a 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR). In addition to regulation by
abundance, my lab discovered that protein function can be regulated by 3′UTRs as during protein synthesis
3′UTRs mediate protein-protein interactions. 3′UTR-dependent protein complex assembly is mediated by the
local translation environment. Each mRNA generates its own translation environment that consists of the
proteins bound by the mRNA together with the recruited proteins. As a result, mRNA isoforms with alternative
3′UTRs – that often differ substantially in length – provide drastically different translation environments, and
thus encode different protein functions. Currently, thousands of 3′UTR-dependent functions are unknown
because they cannot be inferred from canonical protein functions. We have developed a method to
systematically identify protein functions mediated by long 3′UTR isoforms of multi-UTR genes using a
CRISPR-based approach. We will identify 3′UTRs that mediate so far unknown protein functions involved in
the evasion of cell death, in the regulation of migration, and differentiation.
We currently know of two ways to achieve 3′UTR-dependent functions. As described above, an mRNA that
contains a long 3′UTR can generate its own translation environment. Moreover, mRNAs can use elements in
their 3′UTRs to localize to pre-existing translation environments that are formed by phase-separated cytosolic
compartments. Within these large cytosolic membraneless organelles the environment is generated by many
mRNAs together with their recruited proteins. We discovered such a compartment called TIS granule network.
We determined hundreds of enriched mRNAs and observed that usually only half of transcripts with the same
3′UTR localize to TIS granules. This implies that proteins can have alternative functions depending on whether
they are translated in the cytosol or in TIS granules. Our goal is to investigate how proteins change their
function when translated within TIS granules. To study TIS granule-dependent protein functions, we have
engineered cells that are unable to assemble TIS granules. For candidates whose mRNAs are strongly
enriched in TIS granules, we are investigating if translation in TIS granules controls the addition of post-
translational modifications, the establishment of specific protein complexes, or if it suppresses protein
aggregation.
If successful, our research will reveal a widespread role of mRNA in the compartmentalization and physical
scaffolding during translation. It will show how elements in 3′UTRs contribute to the diversification of protein
function. In the long-term, it will facilitate the development of mRNA therapeutics where inclusion of specific
3′UTR elements allows mRNAs to encode proteins with more robust or alternative functions."
10852959,"Measles (MeV) causes disease worldwide despite efforts towards eradication by
vaccine, largely because it is spread so readily between people. Acute MeV infection
causes immune amnesia, resulting in increased susceptibility to other infectious
diseases. In addition, rare but severe neurological complications can develop several
years after measles due to persistent MeV infection of the central nervous system.
People with impaired cellular immunity are at increased risk of developing severe
measles, but often cannot be vaccinated since the vaccine virus itself can lead to fatal
illness. There is no specific therapy for acute or persistent MeV manifestations. A
successful vaccination campaign could have eradicated MeV more than 20 years ago.
As of today, eradication is not in sight and the resurgence of measles in the U.S. 2019
highlights the need for effective measures to prevent host-to-host transmission at the
moment of the outbreak surge. We have recently described a new MeV-specific fusion
inhibitor peptide that combines viral-specific targeting, self-assembling, and cell-
membrane integration leading to a MeV fusion inhibitor that outperformed our previous
fusion inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. This application will test whether this new inhibitor
prevents inter-host transmission and therefore fill this medical demand. We propose to
chemical engineer these inhibitors to optimize 1) the viral-specific targeting, 2) the
insertion on infected cells membrane, and 3) in vivo biodistribution. Our work will be
tested in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo using a natural model of morbillivirus infection (Canine
Distemper Virus -CDV- in Ferrets).
1. To use protein engineering to optimize the self-assembling properties and
antiviral potency of HRC-peptide fusion inhibitors.
2. To evaluate the protection afforded by HRC peptide fusion inhibitors against
CDV infection in vivo and provide proof of concept for pre-clinical development."
10755368,"DNA is packaged by histone proteins into chromatin in order to fit into the nucleus of a cell. Globally, chromatin
can be separated into open, transcriptionally active and closed, transcriptionally silent compartments. Many
different nonhistone, chromatin-binding proteins contribute to global chromatin structure. Chromatin remodeling
enzymes, transcription factors, and transcription-associated RNAs are important for decondensing
transcriptionally active portions of the genome. Heterochromatin proteins and associated noncoding RNAs are
important for condensation of the transcriptionally inactive portions of the genome. Changes in chromatin
organization and compaction are critical for cell state changes during development and chromosome
segregation during mitosis.
 Chromosome structure changes dramatically at the beginning of mitosis as chromosomes compact and
individualize in preparation for segregation. As cells enter into mitosis all of the structure present in the
interphase nucleus is erased. Erasure of interphase nuclear structure is correlated with the stepwise removal
of the Cohesin complex. Chromosome condensation and individualization are accomplished by the combined
action of the Condensin complexes and Topoisomeriase IIα. Interestingly, dramatic changes in chromosome
structure are temporally correlated with suppression of transcription. At the end of mitosis chromosomes
cluster and decondense to reform a single interphase nucleus. Chromosome decondensation and clustering is
accomplished by the rebinding of many different proteins that are removed from chromatin during mitosis and
is temporally correlated with the resumption of nuclear transcription.
 While changes in chromatin structure during mitosis are correlated with changes in nuclear
transcriptional activity, little is known about how the two processes are linked. We have recently discovered
that prophase removal of the Cohesin complex form chromosomes is critical for silencing mitotic transcription
and that removal of chromatin-bound RNAs from chromosomes during mitosis is mediated by phosphorylation
of SAF-A. The identification of molecular pathways linking changes in chromosome structure to changes in
transcriptional activity presents an opportunity to understand how these events are linked. In this proposal we
will reconstitute the biochemistry of nucleic acid interactions mediated by SAF-A to provide a picture of how
this abundant protein controls chromosome structure. We will then examine how removal of SAF-A from
chromatin promotes chromosome condensation during prophase. We will then examine how rebinding of SAF-
A to chromatin at the end of mitosis promotes nuclear reformation and transcriptional activation. Collectively,
the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide new insight into changes in chromatin-RNA interactions
that control chromatin structure and how these changes contribute to accurate chromosome segregation and
transcriptional regulation."
10925373,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has markedly increased in the United States, primarily resulting from injection
drug use (IDU) associated with the ongoing opioid epidemic. Furthermore, >50% of 3.2 million individuals with
chronic HCV remain undiagnosed, leading to significant morbidity and mortality despite the availability of
effective direct-acting antiviral therapy. Due to shared routes of transmission, HCV infection occurs in 15%-40%
of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be used as a marker of HIV exposure.
Emergency departments (EDs) play major roles in screening for HCV infection and HIV infection. Several ED-
based HCV screening programs have been implemented and have identified previously unrecognized HCV
infections, but many challenges remain. Because targeted screening programs use methods that often fail to
detect high-risk behaviors (e.g., self-reported information on prescreening questionnaires or review of patient
problem lists at time of visit), they do not effectively identify persons at high risk of HCV infection (e.g., IDU).
Nontargeted HCV screening strategies require less assessment of risk behaviors. However, concerns such as
high costs and unnecessary tests make nontargeted screening strategies difficult to implement and sustain.
Therefore, an innovative, effective, and sustainable HCV screening strategy is urgently needed.
We propose to develop, implement, and evaluate a tailored, effective, and sustainable, prediction algorithm-
based screening tool called Hepatitis C Emergency Department (HepC-EnD) that can be used by health care
systems to identify patients at high risk of HCV infection. We will achieve these goals through three specific aims.
Aim 1 will develop and validate prediction algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing
to identify patients at risk of HCV infection through Florida’s all-payer electronic health records (EHRs) accessed
via the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. In Aim 2, we will design a HepC-EnD prototype that
incorporates the best prediction algorithms to provide automatic notification to ED providers of patients at high
risk of HCV infection. Informed by implementation science frameworks, we will enhance the functionality and
usability of HepC-EnD through a workshop and qualitative interviews. In Aim 3, we will integrate HepC-EnD into
the University of Florida Health EHR system to deploy and test HepC-EnD in two EDs (Gainesville and
Jacksonville) and compare the performance of HepC-EnD with nontargeted screening using a difference-in-
differences approach. Performance will be assessed by evaluating the usability, acceptability, effectiveness, and
cost-effectiveness of the tool. Our proposed research is highly significant in its integration of a cutting-edge
machine-learning–based prediction and risk stratification tool into an e-platform that will better inform clinical
practice for improving HCV/HIV screening and linking patients with care. Our findings will provide timely data
and adaptable strategies that are key in attaining the national and global goals of eliminating HCV infection."
10813119,"Project Summary
 Although functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs) are the most common causes of bowel
dysfunction worldwide, many patients are inadequately treated because current therapies are frequently
ineffective. The inadequacy of therapy is largely due to an incomplete comprehension of underlying
mechanisms that are critical for the design of new treatments. Up to half of individuals with FGIDs also suffer
from mood disorders. Evidence supports the idea that the GI tract is vulnerable to genetic perturbations that
can exert lasting effects on GI function and mood. It is thus conceivable that a co-morbid FGID and psychiatric
condition result from abnormalities occurring as the result of a genetic variant. Discovery of the
pathophysiology underlying FGIDs and psychiatric co-morbidities is likely to enhance understanding of their
relationship and thus lead to novel therapies for both. Serotonin (5-HT), which is a major determinant of enteric
and central nervous system (ENS and CNS) development and also modulates FGID-related symptoms (GI
motility) as well as mood, may be an important developmental modulator of FGID pathogenesis. It is 5-HT
stimulation of the 5-HT4 receptor, however, that has the most well-studied prokinetic, anti-nociceptive, anti-
depressive, and anti-anxiety effects and has thus been targeted to treat both GI dysmotility and mood
dysfunction. Curiously, however, >50% of patients with FGIDs are relatively unresponsive to them. The
reason for 5-HT4 treatment failure is unknown, making this a critical treatment obstacle. Our preliminary data
strongly suggest that failure to respond to a 5-HT4 agonist is due to a defect in 5-HT4 trafficking. Although
defects in enteric 5-HT4 trafficking have never previously been explored, such abnormalities have been
described in the CNS; p11 is a critical adaptor molecule involved in this transport of 5-HT4 receptors to cell
surfaces, where the receptors become available to mediate 5-HT signaling. P11 also plays a role in depression
(p11KO mice exhibit depressive behaviors and CNS p11 transcription is impaired in mouse models of
depression and human suicide victims). We have found that in the ENS, as in the CNS, gut p11 is co-
expressed with 5-HT4 receptors where they co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that p11 interacts with 5-HT4 in
the gut and, further, that p11 affects 5-HT4 receptor-mediated actions on ENS development and GI motility. Our
hypotheses are thus that p11 facilitation of trafficking of 5-HT4 receptors to cell surfaces is essential for 5-HT4-
modulation of ENS development and function and that p11 dysfunction thus underlies comorbid FGID and
depression. In this application we will explore: (1) How critical the p11-5-HT4 interaction is for effective GI
motility utilizing a comprehensive array of in vivo and ex vivo studies ± the selective 5-HT4 agonist,
prucalopride, in WT and p11KO mice; (2) If effects of p11 on mood (depression / anxiety), ENS development,
and GI motility depend on mucosal or enteric neuronal p11, using novel transgenic mice that selectively lack
p11 in the enteric epithelium or ENS and; (3) If enteric 5-HT4 trafficking and function are p11-dependent."

Detecting cancer early is the best way to fight against cancer. The development of the Multi-Cancer Early
Detection (MCED) liquid biopsy tests holds great promise for integrating early cancer detection into routine
clinical care. However, the current MCED tests have unsatisfactory performance for early-stage cancers.
Recently, we have developed a sensitive and cost-effective technology, named cell-free DNA Methylome
Sequencing (cfMethyl-Seq), which uses the cell-free DNA methylome for early cancer detection. cfMethyl-Seq
provides >12-fold enrichment over whole genome bisulfite sequencing in CpG islands. We performed the proof-
of-principle study by applying cfMethyl-seq to a cohort of colon, liver, lung, and stomach cancer patients and
controls, and obtained promising results in detecting and locating these cancer types. Here, we will further
improve the cfMethyl-seq technology and apply it to detect and locate colon, gastric, liver, and lung cancer. We
will validate this MCED test in multiple clinical cohorts. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following aims:
(1) Continued improvement of the cfMethyl-seq assay for early cancer detection. (2) Continued improvement of
our computational method to analyze the cfDNA methylome assay data. (3) Clinically validate the cfDNA
Methylome assay as an MCED assay with colon/gastric/liver/lung cancers as the first indications. (4) Contribute
to Collaborative Trans-consortium Activities. We have a long-standing collaboration with the industry partner,
EarlyDiagnostics, which will optimize the cfMethyl-seq assay to facilitate its clinical adoption and implement the
computational algorithm in a secure cloud computing platform to facilitate data sharing and decentralized testing."

THEMIS associates with a growing number of inflammatory diseases in humans, including Celiac Disease,
Multiple Sclerosis and Atopic Dermatitis. THEMIS associated disorders affect different anatomical sites and
follow different pathogeneses, placing THEMIS as one of the core “inflammatory”-controllers. Despite the strong
association of THEMIS with multiple inflammatory diseases in humans and the profound defects in T cell
development and selection in THEMIS-deficient mice, the function of THEMIS and the pathways or factors it
interacts with remain enigmatic. THEMIS1 is expressed in T cells where it functions as a key adaptor downstream
of the TCR. In thymocytes it is essential for positive selection leading to the generation of naïve T cells. THEMIS
continues to be expressed in mature CD8ab and CD4 TCRab T cells but its role in mature T cells is not known.
Moreover, THEMIS is expressed in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm and although THEMIS, as a TCR
adaptor, has been well studied, it’s role in the nucleus remains undefined and nothing is known about the
significance of this differential subcellular localization for its function in thymocytes or mature T cells. These
significant gaps in our understanding of the biology of THEMIS greatly impede on the progress to identify the
role of THEMIS in those diseases it is associated with or to design effective strategies to target THEMIS for the
treatment of inflammatory diseases or to enhance protection against infections and cancers. The proposal here
sets out to address these significant gaps with the use of unique new tools to examine THEMIS in the cytoplasm
and nucleus of immature and mature T cells."

 The long-lived myeloid cells such as perivascular macrophages and microglia in the central nervous system
(CNS) persistently harbor HIV. These infected cells could contribute to the source of residual viremia during
long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) or to rebounding virus upon ART cessation. It is undoubtfully and urgently
needed to develop novel strategies to specifically target CNS myeloid cells for HIV eradication and a cure. Be-
cause the effects of the widely-studied “Shock and Kill” approach could exacerbate neuroinflammation, gene
therapy emerges as the optimal strategy, particularly the advanced CRISPR genome editing technology. Simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques is the best available model for testing novel strategies prior
to clinical studies. We have shown that SIV infection has a broad spread in the CNS even in animals on ART.
Because the virus enters the brain within a few days after infection and the establishment of the latent reservoir
occurs very early, the initiation of ART should be as early as possible. In addition, numerous studies suggest
that CCR5/CCR2 play a major role in HIV entry and neuroinflammation. Most importantly, we have used AAV
delivery of a CRISPR/Cas genome editor to eradicate HIV/SIV provirus in models of humanized mice and non-
human primates. However, the lack of AAV serotypes that are highly effective and reliable to transduce myeloid
cells in the CNS remains a key challenge. Therefore, we hypothesize that the multiple-targeting gene editing
system across the blood brain barrier (BBB) can remove SIV provirus in infected myeloid cells, protect cells
against new infection, and inhibit neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, we will optimize a novel AAV sero-
type with BBB penetration and myeloid-specific transduction (namely AAV-BM) to effectively deliver the smaller
cjCas9 with multiplex sgRNAs (BMCj4) specific for 4 target sites (SIV LTR, gag, and host CCR5, CCR2) into the
entire CNS for in vivo HIV/SIV eradication (Aim 1). We will evaluate the efficacy of BMCj4 early treatment in
preventing brain SIV infection or/and excising SIV proviral DNA from brain myeloid cells in acute SIV infection
with early ART (Aim 2a). We will also determine the therapeutic effect of BMCj4 with ART and then boost it with
an alternative AAV-BM for eradication of persistent brain SIV latent infection (Aim 2b). We expect that early or
long-term repeated BMCj4 AAV gene therapy will effectively eradicate acute and latently-infected HIV provirus
and extensively minimize the size of the brain viral reservoir to achieve a sterilizing or functional cure of
HIV/AIDS, particularly NeuroAIDS."

Altered expression of non-coding RNAs are hallmarks of many cancers. One unique characteristic of telomerase-
free cancer cells that use an alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway for telomere maintenance is the
overexpression of telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). TERRA is therefore an attractive target for ALT
cancer diagnosis and therapy. TERRA is transcribed from a subset of telomeres but forms foci on other telomeres
and non-telomere loci. Manipulation of TERRA binding proteins leads to mis-regulation in TERRA localization
and telomere dysfunction, suggesting TERRA function is highly linked to its localization. Visualizing TERRA in
fixed tissue and live cells would therefore provide insights needed for the development of TERRA as a biomarker
for ALT diagnosis or a target for ALT cancer therapy. Current methods for labeling TERRA suffer from either
high background, low efficiency (only label bright TERRA foci), or low selectivity (cannot differentiate TERRA
from telomere DNA). Our preliminary data suggest that fluorescent gPNA miniprobes can detect TERRA in fixed
cells with high efficiency. This is because the high affinity of gPNA allows us to use shorter probes, leading to
hybridization of more probes per TERRA and therefore improving the brightness of TERRA foci. This improved
brightness will also allow detection of shorter TERRA transcripts than is possible with conventional DNA TERRA
FISH probes. In this work, we aim to further improve this method for TERRA visualization in fixed cells and
extend the capacity into live cell imaging. In Aim 1, we will systematically vary gPNA probe length to achieve high
selectivity in labeling TERRA vs telomeric DNA, following up on promising preliminary data indicating that a 9mer
gPNA can accomplish this whereas a 12mer cannot. In Aim 2, we will achieve low background in TERRA labeling
by designing fluorescent gPNA pairs that will emit signal through Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
only when they bind to TERRA close to each other. The unbound gPNA probes will not FRET and thus exhibit
low background. In Aim 3, we will use a synthetic cationic polymer vector to deliver gPNA to live cells to track
TERRA dynamics in real time. The optimized gPNA probes that detect TERRA with higher efficiency, high
selectivity and low background can be used to detect TERRA in fixed tissue to aid ALT cancer therapy. The
ability to monitor TERRA dynamics in live cells can be used to understand how TERRA contributes to telomere
elongation and other cellular functions in ALT cancer cells and inspire novel therapeutic strategies targeting
TERRA. Beyond TERRA, the design principles can be used to visualize other non-coding RNAs linked to various
cancers, particularly those implicated in dynamic processes such as chromatin organization that are challenging
to study with current methods. Simultaneously, by designing a library of probes for different non-coding RNAs,
our methods can be used to dissect how different non-coding RNAs work with each other to promote the growth
of cancerous cells."

U.S. physicians are at risk for poor mental health and work-related wellbeing. Obstetrician-
gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are at particularly high risk due to recent changes and uncertainty in
state-level reproductive health policies. Associated changes in the work environment may lead
to burnout, poor mental health, and job turnover, which could have major health consequences
for OB-GYNs and their patients. Our scientific premise is that the key to improving OB-
GYNs' mental health and work-related wellbeing in a shifting policy climate is to focus on
the role of organizational factors in buffering the impact of policy stressors. Accordingly,
there is an urgent need to (1) better understand the relationships between state policy
environment, work-related stressors, and mental health and work-related wellbeing, and (2)
identify organizational-level factors that support OB-GYNs' health and wellbeing. Leveraging our
interdisciplinary team's expertise in workplace health and wellbeing, experience with survey
methods and policy analysis, and our preliminary data, we propose a convergent mixed-
methods study of OB-GYNs from across the U.S. We will administer a quantitative survey to
800-900 OB-GYNs to (1) test whether OB-GYNs' mental health, work-related wellbeing, and
turnover intention vary by policy context, and (2) evaluate the nature of the relationship between
policy context, work experiences, and mental health and work-related wellbeing (Aim 1). We will
conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with 80 OB-GYNs from a range of state policy
climates. We will then use mixed methods to synthesize survey and interview findings about the
contributions of specific organizational policies and practices to OB-GYN mental health and
work-related wellbeing, within and across policy contexts (Aim 2). Finally, we will draw on Aim 1-
2 findings and solicit input from key informant interviews (n=10) to develop and disseminate
organizational-level resources to support OB-GYNs' mental health and work-related wellbeing
(Aim 3, r2p). We will engage an interdisciplinary expert advisory board to inform the design,
analysis, and dissemination. Our long-term goal is to protect and promote the work-related
wellbeing of the healthcare workforce. By generating novel data from a national sample of
OB-GYNs, this study will inform evidence-based recommendations and interventions to support
OB-GYN mental health and work-related wellbeing. Its impacts support NIOSH's Total Worker
Health® and Healthcare Worker Mental Health Initiatives, the NORA Healthcare and Social
Assistance sector, and NORA's cross-sector program in Healthy Work Design and Wellbeing."

Malaria is still responsible for an estimated 429,000 deaths and 212 million infections per year, the large majority
among young children. Individuals living in endemic regions gradually develop an immune response that protects
against symptomatic disease. Naturally acquired immunity targets the blood stage of the parasite’s life cycle and
is largely dependent on antibody reactivity. Elicitation of a similar immune response by vaccination in young,
non-immune children would dramatically reduce malaria morbidity and mortality. Various parasite antigens have
been associated with protection against clinical disease. Most of these antigens are expressed in the merozoite
stage and are involved in invasion of the red blood cell. However, vaccine trials based on these blood-stage
antigens have thus far been unsuccessful. One factor contributing to the failure of blood stage vaccines is the
extensive genetic diversity between different parasite strains that has resulted in strain-specific, but not strain-
transcending, antibody responses. Studies of naturally acquired immunity suggest that protected individuals
harbor antibodies against conserved epitopes. The identification of such conserved epitopes could serve as a
blueprint for structure-based design of a malaria blood stage vaccine. We hypothesize that immunity against
malaria is dependent on high affinity IgGs with cross-strain reactivity against merozoite antigens and
that these antibodies can be used to define conserved epitopes on merozoite vaccine candidates. To test
this hypothesis, we will compare the molecular and functional characteristics of antibodies directed against
merozoite antigens among immune adults, semi-immune children and non-immune children living in Tororo,
Uganda, a region with extremely high malaria transmission intensity, and use the most potent and broadly
reactive antibodies for epitope mapping. In Specific Aim 1, we will isolate merozoite antigen-specific memory B
cells from these individuals, test the ability of these antibodies to inhibit various malaria parasite strains in vitro,
and map the epitopes of cross-strain reactive antibodies to define conserved epitopes on merozoite antigens. In
Specific Aim 2, we will deep-sequence the memory B cell receptor repertoire to uncover the impact of life-long
malaria exposure on the humoral immune response, analyze the repertoire of anti-merozoite serum antibodies
and determine the cross-strain inhibitory activity and epitopes of dominant serum antibody clonotypes.
Collectively, the results from these experiments will provide detailed information about the types of antibodies
that a blood-stage vaccine should ideally elicit and will enable the design of novel immunogens to elicit strain-
transcending antibodies against the malaria blood stage. In addition, it will provide insight into the overlap and
differences between the memory B cell and serological compartments, and the selective mechanisms that drive
B cell differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells."

Chronic stress is pervasive in our society and linked to a reduced quality of life and increased risk for developing chronic diseases. Treatment options, including changes in lifestyle, exercise, and anxiolytics, are only partially effective and would benefit from a deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the negative effects of chronic stress on the brain. Here we start by focusing on key restorative processes that occur during the inactive phase - the light period in rodents and the dark period in humans - when animals are asleep and for many hours brain activity is characterized by the presence of spindles and slow waves. These restorative processes involve integrated changes in astrocytes and neurons and include glymphatic clearance and renormalization (weakening) of synaptic strength. The former, by removing metabolic waste, reduces the risk of toxic waste build-up and the latter, by reducing the strength of synapses and the size of the perisynaptic astrocytic coverage, keeps the cost of synaptic activity under control and promotes future learning. It has been known for decades that the activity of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) decreases during the inactive phase, leading to a progressive decline in noradrenaline (NE) levels in the brain. However, we and others have recently found that this decline is not monotonic: there are large, infraslow NE oscillations (INO) that occur in association with spindles and slow waves. We postulate that INO, combined with progressively lower NE levels and slow waves, are key to promote the cellular restorative processes occurring during the inactive phase. Based on this observation, we will use a mouse model of chronic stress to test the novel hypothesis that chronic stress disrupts the slow wave rich inactive phase and its complex NE dynamics, thereby impairing both astrocytic and neuronal restorative processes, including glymphatic clearance and renormalization of synaptic strength and of perisynaptic astrocytic coverage. To test our hypothesis we will combine recordings of brain activity (EEG/EMG), neuromodulators’ dynamics (voltammetry and NE sensors), serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, and brain fluid dynamics, along with optogenetic manipulation of NE/LC. We will use memory performance and sensitivity to painful stimulation as behavioral measures of the cellular restorative processes. Finally, we will test whether a non-pharmacological intervention, mild acoustic stimulation, can counteract the negative effects of chronic stress on astrocytes and neurons by restoring normal INO and slow waves. The proposal is organized in 2 aims. Aim 1 will define the cellular targets for the NE dynamics, including glymphatic clearance, synaptic weakening and renormalization of astrocytic synaptic coverage and glycogen storage. Aim 2 will test whether mild auditory stimulation in chronic stress can boost slow waves and normalize INO, thus improving the cellular restorative processes, memory performance and pain threshold. The proposed experiments are challenging but will benefit from the complementary expertise of the Nedergaard and Cirelli labs. If successful, the experiments will provide fundamental new insights into the biology of both astrocytes and neurons and their dysfunction in chronic stress."

Preclinical models of lung cancer are essential tools for researchers to understand cancer biology and develop
therapeutic strategies. Choosing the most cost-effective preclinical model to answer a specific scientific question
requires careful study of the existing molecular and pathological characterization of different models and human
tumors, as molecular profiling reveals the orchestration of biological processes and pathological characterization
informs the spatial composition of the tumor microenvironment. While preclinical models of lung cancer have
been extensively characterized, the molecular data remain scattered, the pathology data have rarely been
deposited, and no tool exists to evaluate the molecular and pathological agreement between preclinical models
and human tumors. We have previously built a lung cancer explorer, which provides user-friendly integrative
analytical tools to explore gene expression and clinical data from over 6,700 patients in 56 published datasets.
Leveraging patient lung tumor pathology image archives, we developed algorithms and pipelines to perform
histopathology digital staining and feature extraction from H&E images and identified interesting pathology
features that predict outcome and response to targeted therapy. Extending these efforts to preclinical models,
this proposal aims to develop an informatics platform integrating molecular and pathology data from various lung
cancer preclinical models and patient tumors to assess preclinical model fidelity through comparative analyses.
Specific Aim 1 will harmonize molecular profiling datasets from various lung cancer preclinical models.
Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be implemented to ensure computational
compatibility and to select appropriate datasets for analysis. Model-specific web applications will be built to
support data exploration and analysis.
Specific Aim 2 will perform histopathological and spatial transcriptomic characterization of tumors from in vivo
models. We will network with lung cancer preclinical model investigators to solicit contributions of pathology
images and samples for establishing a public image archive and for spatial molecular profiling experiments.
Effective algorithms and pipelines for preclinical model pathology image analyses will be established.
Specific Aim 3 will integrate data collected and harmonized in Aims 1 and 2 to construct an informatics platform
for cross-model comparison and alignment to human tumors. This platform will allow users to review and
download our processed molecular and pathology datasets and compare molecular and pathology profiles of
preclinical models and patient tumors from multiple facets. We will share these resources with the lung cancer
research community and solicit feedback to improve our platform.
The successful implementation of this project will assemble the scattered molecular datasets, establish a large-
scale public pathology image and spatial molecular profiling resource, and establish a user-friendly integrative
fidelity assessment platform for lung cancer preclinical models."
10791908,"Project Summary/ Abstract: The Republic of Mozambique, a Portuguese-speaking country of 28 million
people on the southeast coast of Africa, has experienced significant economic growth and distinct progress in
improving health indicators over the past two decades. Since the end of a devastating civil war in 1992, health
has been a government priority, particularly in response to the crushing burden of HIV/AIDS (the 2015 national
prevalence was estimated at 13.2% among adults aged 15-49 years). The UN’s 2018 Human Development

While national efforts to expand HIV health care service delivery have focused on strengthening community-
based and regional clinics, there has simultaneously been significant targeted investment to build infrastructure
and human capacity in HIV research, innovation, and health education. Medical research, including
epidemiologic and health services research, has grown dramatically. This growth has stemmed from both
international collaborative projects, such as our current D43 Partnership for Research in Implementation
Science- Mozambique (PRISM) award between the Faculty of Medicine at University Eduardo Mondale (UEM)
and the Vanderbilt Institute for Global Health (VIGH) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), and also
from Mozambique’s increased emphasis on research as a key component of professional and graduate
education in biomedical sciences and public health.
Through this renewal application we seek to substantially build upon the groundwork laid by the PRISM
collaboration for HIV implementation science research capacity at UEM, Mozambique´s principal medical
school. With the strong academic foundation established through PRISM, we now focus on further
strengthening UEM´s local HIV implementation science research capacity and will support UEM over the next
five years to assume full ownership of this program. We will maximize opportunities in our newly created cohort
of PRISM alumni with Master´s level experience in HIV implementation science as well as the newly launched
UEM Faculty of Medicine Implementation Science Unit, leveraging resources to provide doctoral studies via an
enhanced UEM PhD program for four scholars as well as four faculty fellowships so that all may achieve the
academic requirements needed to become successful independent researchers.
Our Specific Aims are to 1) Train PhD scientists from UEM in HIV implementation science research and
strengthen the UEM PhD program; 2) Solidify the UEM Faculty of Medicine Implementation Science Unit as a
Center of Excellence in Implementation Science training and research; and 3) Expand opportunities for the
conduct of HIV implementation science research by capacitating two Mozambican HIV research
institutions/field sites (Aurum-Mozambique and the Center for Health Research-Manhiça [CISM])."

 Innovative interventions that support young cisgender women’s (YCW) use of PrEP are critically needed.
Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa continue to have disproportionately high
HIV incidence, particularly AGYW in Siaya County, Kenya. Existing intrapersonal-, interpersonal-, and clinic-
level PrEP interventions will likely be more successful when embedded within supportive environments where
prevailing social norms encourage YCW’s use of PrEP and normalize, rather than stigmatize, its use. Findings
from our recent R21 highlight the negative impact on YCW’s PrEP use due to PrEP-related stigma by
communities members, suggesting a need for broader-level interventions. The purpose of this R01 is to
develop, pre-test, and pilot a community-level, ethnodrama intervention designed to transform community
member beliefs about and foster support of YCW’s PrEP use, thereby reducing enacted PrEP-related stigma
toward YCW and anticipated and internalized stigma among YCW. In Aim 1, we will develop the ethnodrama
intervention. The Eldoret Film Festival, a Kenya-based drama group, together with Theater Delta, a U.S.-based
organization focused on fostering social change through interactive theater, will use our R21 findings to create
a series of ethnodrama performances designed to change the narrative on YCW’s PrEP use. In Aim 2, we will
pre-test the ethnodrama intervention with YCW who have taken/are taking PrEP, female peers of YCW, male
partners of YCW, healthcare providers, informal community leaders, and family members of YCW (n=60).
During two rounds of pre-testing, we will assess the acceptability of the ethnodrama’s storylines and interactive
components through small group discussions and explore the intervention’s effect on transforming participants’
PrEP-related perceptions using a validated Narrative Transportation Scale (NTS) and other assessments. In
Aim 3, we will publicly pilot the ethnodrama intervention in its entirety in multiple areas in one sub-county of
Siaya, focusing on assessing the feasibility of implementing the ethnodrama intervention and exploring the
intervention’s perceived effectiveness on transforming beliefs, creating support of YCW’s PrEP use, and
reducing stigma. Among a study cohort of YCW who have taken/are taking PrEP (n=20), we will administer a
validated PrEP-related stigma scale pre-pilot, immediately post-pilot, and 3 months post-pilot and conduct in-
depth interviews (IDIs) to explore responses to the PrEP stigma scale and perceptions of the intervention’s
potential impact on reducing PrEP-related stigma. We will also administer the NTS and other assessments with
randomly-selected audience members (n=20) for each performance, and administer the NTS and other
assessments, including IDIs on the intervention’s potential impact on reducing PrEP-related stigma, with a
community member study cohort (n=20), immediately post-pilot. By achieving our study aims, we will have the
experience to rapidly initiate and implement the ethnodrama intervention on a larger scale in a subsequent
effectiveness R01 that will measure its effect on PrEP adherence and persistence among YCW."
10932901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is sexually dimorphic in its prevalence, incidence, symptomology, and neuropathology,
but the mechanisms underlying these sex differences are not well understood. While sex differences in
susceptibility to inflammation and AD progression have been reported, the relationship between neuro and
systemic inflammation and sex differences remains understudied. Our preliminary single-nucleus genomic
analyses have identified sex-specific microglial gene signatures in AD patient brains. Single-cell transcriptomic
data analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) implies that multiple sex-specific, candidate
pro-inflammatory genes highly overexpressed in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and other immune
cell types in AD. We therefore posit that an interplay between microglia and systematic inflammatory
mechanisms (termed the “Microglial activation and inflammatory endophenotypes”) exists and that
understanding this system will be essential to improve the mechanistic elucidation of AD pathogenesis and
therapeutic development in a sex-specific manner. Recent advances of multimodal single-cell genomic and
epigenomic analyses have shed insights into a comprehensive understanding of the neuro-immune and
peripheral immune systems underlying sex differences in AD. Integration of the single-cell transcriptome,
epigenome, the human interactome, along with large-scale AD genetic loci and functional genomic data from
existing diverse AD cohorts are essential for such identification. To address this hypothesis, our short-term goal
is to identify next-generation immune modulators for AD sex differences and molecularly targeted treatment
development in both male and female patients with AD. We will leverage large-scale single-cell genomic and
epigenomic data generated from human brains and bloods with varying degrees of AD pathology available at
our National Institute of Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that microglial activation and central neuro-immune transcriptional networks mediate sex differences
in AD using single-nucleus genomic (snRNA-seq) and epigenomic (snATAC-seq) analyses of human frozen
brain tissues. In parallel, we will utilize network-based, integrative analyses of snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data
from human frozen brains and large-scale genetic and functional genomic data from existing AD cohorts with
diverse population to identify glial cell type-specific promoters and enhancers that encode sex-specific master
gene regulatory networks for AD. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that cell type-specific peripheral immune
signatures and interactome network changes in AD pathogenesis and progression act in a sex-specific manner.
In summary, our project will identify clinically actionable immune molecular mechanisms underlying sex
differences in AD pathobiology from the central neuro-immune and peripheral immune systems. The successful
completion of this project will advance the understanding of sex difference in AD and serve as the foundation for
future translational studies to inform the development of precision medicine in a sex-specific manner."

of the Florida Learning Disabilities Research Center to explicitly address the research to practice gap
associated with the identification and treatment of children with specific learning disabilities (SLD) in word
reading and reading comprehension. The Center is organized around the translational science continuum and
the concept of multi-disciplinary team science as a necessary approach to tackle complex public health
problems such as the study of SLD. To date, much of the research conducted in SLD classification and
treatment has not included samples that mirror the diversity of the country, raising questions of applicability of
existing research findings to diverse student populations. This Center has four research projects and three
cores (administrative, data management, and engagement) that work synergistically to address applied
research questions about SLD with diverse student samples. The research projects represent the translational
science continuum (T1-T4). Project 1 addresses identification, classification, and risk prediction of SLD. Project
2 (high risk) investigates the genetic and environmental influence on the responsiveness to intervention for
children who show early signs of reading risk. Project 3 (engagement) uses an implementation science
approach to better understand how to develop sustainable process for assessment systems in authentic school
settings. Project 4 will utilize population level screening data to better understand classification systems at
scale. Every project addresses the required theme of a substantial emphasis on diverse participants and has
embedded plans to engage early career researchers and community members to enhance the translation of
findings into practice."
10757386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Vision Sciences Society is a nonprofit membership organization of nearly 2000 scientists interested in the
functional aspects of vision. VSS was founded in 2001 with the purpose of bringing together scientists from a
broad range of disciplines including visual psychophysics, visual neuroscience, computational vision and visual
cognition. The scientific content of the meetings reflects the breadth of topics and interconnected ideas and
approaches in modern vision science, from visual coding to perception, recognition and the visual control of
action, as well as recent developments in cognitive psychology, computer vision and neuroimaging. Since its
founding, VSS has provided a forum and framework for communicating advances in vision science, and VSS
has become a flagship conference for the field. The interdisciplinary nature of VSS is reflected in the
deliberately diverse membership of the Board of Directors and Abstract Review Committee. Many of the faculty
from institutions in the United States who attend VSS are principal investigators of National Eye Institute
grants; hence, the research objectives of the programs of the National Institutes of Health and of the National
Eye Institute are well-represented in the program planning and individual presentations. Over 60% of
participants are predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Of these 55% are US citizens. VSS provides multiple
career development opportunities: (1) the platform and poster presentations provide a forum for trainees to
showcase their work and receive feedback, (2) career-development workshops cover topics such as “Getting
that Faculty Job”, “Reviewing and Responding to Reviews”, “The Public Face of your Science”, “Careers in
Industry and Government”, “Faculty Careers at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions”, and include panel
discussions with journal editors, NIH and NSF grant officers, and academic and industry representatives, (3) a
“Meet the Professors” event in which trainees meet in small groups with members of the VSS Board and other
professors for free-wheeling, open-ended discussions, and (4) a partnership with ARVO to host a symposium
series that exposes VSS attendees to advances in clinical research from ARVO members and ARVO
attendees to advances in basic research from VSS members. VSS also provides many formal events and
informal opportunities for networking with peers and senior colleagues in a comfortable and engaging setting.
The large contingent of early-stage investigators at VSS is a sign of the strong health of the field and the
opportunity VSS provides for advancing the field. Our goal is to facilitate access and participation for this next
generation of vision scientists. VSS previously received a one-year R13 award to support the 2019 meeting by
providing travel awards for postdoctoral trainees and early-career faculty. Based on the success and positive
impact of this initial support, the purpose of this 5-year proposal is to provide 48 travel awards per year for
early-career investigators to attend the 2020-2024 meetings, with the focus on attracting and supporting a
diverse pool of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and pre-tenure faculty who
demonstrate potential for future success as vision researchers and whose research findings will be presented
at the meeting. Funds are also requested to offset the registration costs for undergraduate attendees in order
to significantly expand access and participation at the conference for students first encountering the field of
vision science."

Approximately 80% of patients beginning hemodialysis (HD) in the United States use a catheter at treatment
initiation, and 18.6% of all HD patients were using a catheter in 2017. However, the HD catheters (HDC) used
for longer-term dialysis in patients have a high complication rate because of infections and dysfunction, with a
catheter dysfunction rate of 0.5–3.42 episodes/1000 catheter-days. The most common catheter-related
problems are infections (catheter-related bloodstream infections; CRBSI) and thrombosis. Fibrin sheath
formation has a close relationship with pathogen colonization and biofilm formation on the catheter surface.
The entry of pathogens into the bloodstream through the catheter-extraluminal and intraluminal routes and the
seeding of pathogens that develop biofilm on the catheter surface cause CRBSI. In the US, annual HD
treatment costs ~$89,000 per patient, with total costs of $42 billion. In 2016, 80% of patients used a catheter at
initiation of HD and 18.6% of all HD patients in the US were using a catheter in 2017. However, no available
solutions to prevent catheter dysfunction can successfully prevent both thrombosis and infection.
FFMD is aiming to optimize and commercialize tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP) coatings on medical
devices. Our TLP coating stops the adhesion of all biological components (bacteria, fungi, blood components)
to the surface of medical devices by immobilizing a thin layer of highly inert and biocompatible perfluorinated
liquid. In preliminary work, we optimized our TLP coating technology for HDC by incorporating a thin
fluoropolymer layer on the catheter surface. We also demonstrated that the optimized coating could reduce
colonization by CRBSI pathogens by >85% vs. uncoated polyurethane catheter while also effectively reducing
fibrinogen adhesion and thrombosis on the catheter surface.
The objective of this Direct to Phase II SBIR application is to complete our path toward marketability with our
TLP-modified HDC (TLP HDC). Using a previously established domestic sheep model, we will test the central
hypothesis that TLP HDC will out-perform standard HDC by decreasing fibrin sheath formation, which has a
close relationship with both catheter dysfunction and biofilm formation. This will be achieved using three aims.
Aim 1: Compare the in vivo effectiveness of TLP HDC and standard HDC (Palindrome®) at reducing fibrin
sheath formation and catheter tip occlusion. Aim 2: Obtain GMP-manufactured TLP HDC. Aim 3: Initiate the
510(k) application process to obtain FDA premarketing approval and perform a biocompatibility study. These
advances will allow FFMD to maximize the effectiveness of the TLP coating and dramatically improve HD
patient care by reducing catheter dysfunction and the CRBSI rate in clinical settings."

Multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial infections are a major threat to human health as mortality
rates are steadily on the rise. One of the defining characteristics of K. pneumoniae is a robust capsule that aids
in resistance to the human complement system, host antimicrobial peptides, and last resort therapeutic
polymyxins. However, there have not been significant efforts to identify the attributes that allow active peptides
to bypass the capsule of K. pneumoniae. I have previously discovered a novel mechanism of peptide
disruption of the capsule barrier of K. pneumoniae. I hypothesize there are amino acid residues that change
the physiochemical attributes and allow for penetration through the capsule. During the K99 phase of this
proposal I will: 1) Define how host defense peptides fit into the novel mechanism of capsule disruption; and 2)
Identify broader set of physiochemical characteristics that allow for disruption of the K. pneumoniae capsule.
The objective of these aims is to determine how well studied host defense peptides fit into the mechanism of
capsule disruption using biochemical and biophysical experiments and determine the physiochemical attributes
that allow for peptide aggregation and disruption of K. pneumoniae capsule. The R00 phase will build on the
K99 phase, to identify the structural components of bacterial capsule that is aggregating with peptides and
reveal the implications of therapeutic capsule removal on the infection process of K. pneumoniae using
peptides discovered in the K99 phase. The K99/R00 award will allow me to utilize the extensive resources
available at the University of Texas at Austin while working with my mentor team to ensure successful
transition to an independent research position. The results of the studies completed in this award will provide a
greater understanding of peptide disruption of capsule and how this changes the infection process of K.
pneumoniae."

Infection causes inflammation, which contributes to pathogen clearance and survival of the host
organism. However, failure to regulate the inflammatory response can often lead to multiple organ
damage and lethality for the host. In the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), patients with elevated cytokine levels are
often associated with severe symptoms and mortality. This indicates hyper-activation of specific
inflammatory molecules might be as much a contributing factor to mortality and morbidity as the
virus itself. Thus, there is a dire need to better understand the gene activation dynamics upon
infection and develop therapies to manage the inflammatory response. In 2016 we have shown
that epigenetic inhibition of factors controlling chromatin remodeling of inflammatory genes, like
Topoisomerase 1, can reduce inflammatory gene expression and rescue lethality during bacterial
and viral infection, suggesting that these effects may be applicable in the setting of COVID-19 as
well. Topoisomerase 1 inhibitors are FDA approved and in the list of WHO essential medicines,
thus their widespread usage and cheap cost can be leverage if they are active against COVID-19
as they are in many other infections. In this proposal, we will characterize the role of Top1 and
epigenetic factors controlling chromatin topology during SARS-CoV-2 infection and will test the
feasibility of use of Top1 inhibitors as drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in animal models. We
will perform mechanistic and preclinical test using epigenetic inhibitors in comparison with
immune blockers used in clinical trials and the current standard of care (glucocorticoids)."

In India, cervical cancer (CC) remains one of the most common malignancies among women, with about 100,000
women diagnosed annually. HIV promotes the progression of precancerous lesions. Among women living with
HIV/AIDS, a lack of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) screening, coupled with high levels of depressive symptoms and
stigma, along with malnutrition, negatively impact the activation and proliferation of immune cells, further promoting
development of precancerous lesions in the cervix. Programs for women living with HIV (WLH) that include HPV
screening and psychosocial and nutritional support are almost non-existent, and the gap is critical in hopes of reducing
high CC incidence rates. In our recently completed R01 study of 600 WLH in rural India, we assessed the impact of our
“ASHA-Nutrition” intervention, co-delivered by our community health workers (ASHA), and led by nurses, in providing
emotional support, skill-building, nutrition education, and/or protein-enriched food supplements. Our findings revealed
that the nurse-led ASHA support plus protein supplements and nutritional education showed a significant association
with improved CD4+ T cell counts and increased lean mass at 18 months as well as improved depression, social
support and stigma. CC screening of 598 of these WLH revealed 13% had abnormal cervical lesions and 4 (1%) had
squamous CC. Further, our preliminary data suggest that nutritional supplements may be associated with a 40%
reduction in the risk of abnormal cervical lesions. Our stellar team plans to build upon our prior successful model to refine
our newly developed nurse-led, ASHA co-delivered, nutrition-enhanced, ASHA-Health HPV intervention, adapted to the
needs of a high-risk sub-population of women co-infected with HPV and HIV (W-Co-V), and randomized by village
clusters among women treated in antiretroviral treatment (ART) centers in underserved Karnataka, India. With a major
focus on secondary prevention of CC, we hope to mitigate the link between high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)
persistence (measured as 2 positive tests for the same HR-HPV type, separated by 12 -18 months), risk of CC, as well
as improved health of W-Co-V. We will conduct a parallel-group cluster randomized clinical trial, assessing the efficacy of
our refined comprehensive, ASHA-Health HPV intervention, as it relates to CC prevention, ongoing engagement in the
HIV treatment cascade, and managing nutritional health among 420 high-risk co-infected women, as compared with an
enhanced Standard of Care (SOC+). Our Primary outcome is HR-HPV persistence. Secondary outcomes will be the
improvement in: 1) HIV indices (HIV viral load and CD4+ T cells); 2) Nutritional indices (serum albumin levels, Vitamin A,
Vitamin D, and Iron); 3) Mental health (depression and HPV/HIV internalized stigma); and 4) Engagement in care
(HPV/HIV appointment keeping and ART adherence); all measures will be assessed at baseline, and at 6-, 12-, and 18-
month follow-ups. The ASHA-Health HPV Intervention builds on a highly successful multifaceted US-Indo collaboration
of over 10 years, has a high potential for scale-up in India, and engages HPV co-infected WLH in reducing the risk of CC
as well as improving their health. The success of this intervention can lead to policy development and future
implementation science trials in the prevention of CC among co-infected Indian women."
10768712,"The social stigmatization of HIV impedes every step along the HIV continuum of care, including accessing HIV
care, adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and sustaining HIV viral suppression. HIV stigma also intersects
with other stigmatized identities, such as gender and sexual orientation, with intersectional stigma creating
unique experiences and barriers to HIV care. Research investigating intersectional stigma is gaining traction in
high-income countries, however, studies of intersectional stigma across internalized, enacted, and anticipated
stigma mechanisms remains limited, and has not yet been reported in the low-income countries of sub-
Saharan Africa. Thus, while behavioral interventions to reduce the effects of HIV stigma are essential to ending
HIV epidemics, studies have not yet identified intersecting stigmatized identities and their impacts on ART
adherence in countries with high-HIV prevalence, such as South Africa. The absence of empirically validated
psychometric measures of intersectional HIV stigma is hampering research and interventions in places with the
greatest need. The proposed fellowship leverages an existing research infrastructure and project resources in
South Africa to conduct two-phases of intersectional stigma research. Phase 1 will conduct elicitation
interviews with women, sexual minority men, and heterosexual men receiving ART from an HIV clinic in Cape
Town, South Africa. The interviews will probe participants’ experiences with respect to intersecting stigmatized
identities. Insights gained from the interviews will inform the selection and tailoring of stigma scale items. An
independent sample of clinic patients will provide feedback on the items and the identified stigmatized
identities will be implemented in a novel approach to assessing intersectional stigma using a geometric
conceptualization of intersectionality grounded in the HIV Stigma Framework to assess intersectional
internalized, enacted, and anticipated stigma. In Phase 2, the newly developed intersectional stigma scales will
be tested for reliability, construct validity, and predictive validity in a short-term prospective study of women,
sexual minority men, and heterosexual men in HIV care and receiving ART. The completion of the study aims
will offer a novel approach to assessing intersectional HIV stigma in South Africa that will inform behavioral
interventions to promote ART uptake and adherence."
10768726,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sepsis is one of the major healthcare problems in the United States with an annual patient care cost approaching $23
billion. Despite a substantial decrease in inpatient mortality over the past 15 years, the current epidemiology indicates a
disturbing increase in the number of sepsis survivors who develop a chronic critical illness (CCI) phenotype featuring
prolonged ICU stay and poor long-term outcomes. The most important clinical challenge in sepsis care today is identifying
early and continuously monitor those patients with a high risk of either dying or developing CCI. Previous clinical studies
show unstable sepsis patients have distinct immunologic subtypes (endotype) defined by the level and fluctuation of
circulating immunomodulators over time. Unfortunately, current standard immunoassays (e.g. ELISA) provide only
intermittent sampling of biomarker levels with a sample-to-result time of several hours to days, which is insufficient for
timely clinical decision making using immune endotypes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop improved
bioanalytical tools for predicting clinical trajectory and tailoring medical intervention based on sepsis patient’s individual
pathophysiologic endotype. The overall objective in this application is to develop a biosensor platform that addresses the
analytical needs of immunologic endotyping in sepsis patient care. A major technical challenge in the real-time monitoring
of biomolecules is achieving fast response while maintaining low limit of detection (LOD). To resolve this conflict, the
application proposes to adopt the thermal cycling process used in PCR and repurpose it for real-time protein detection. We
will develop affinity reagents with temperature-selective binding properties (aim 1). This novel affinity reagent will be
integrated with an ultrafast photothermal cycling sensor platform to enable sensitive and frequent biomolecular monitoring
(aim 2). In aim 1 we will use in vitro selection to identify binders with temperature-sensitive affinity towards a 3- biomarker
panel containing two immune-modulating proteins (i.e. IL-6 and sPD-L1) and a tissue injury indicator thrombomodulin.
The optimum temperature range and binding curve for the selected reagents will be characterized. In aim 2 we will develop
a sensor platform capable of frequent, multiplexed detection of IL-6, sPD-L1 and thrombomodulin in human whole blood.
The research proposed is innovative because it combines novel affinity reagents and sensing mechanisms to reconcile the
slow off-rate needed for sensitive detection and the fast off-rate needed for fast assay time. The proposed technology is
significant because it is generally applicable to many diseases associated with uncontrolled, systematic inflammatory
response, such as the management of severe COVID-19 patients and treatment for patients with cytokine release syndrome
after immunotherapy. Furthermore, the successful completion of this project will form the basis for future studies, such as
the clinical study on immunologic endotypes diagnostic values at different stages of sepsis, the pharmacokinetics of novel
therapeutics, and the closed-loop intervention of chronic diseases."

 The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first detected in
November-December 2019, has inflicted millions of deaths worldwide. In the US, the outbreak is affecting
millions of lives. The VA hospitals, including the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (JJP VAMC) in the Bronx,
NY, have responded promptly to provide care to Veterans and employees. Veterans are typically older than the
general US population, making them highly susceptible to severe disease. COVID-19 vaccines are also
distributed initially to the elderly and other high-risk individuals. This provides the VA a unique opportunity to
study SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in the most vulnerable individuals.
 This VA Merit application proposes to investigate the protective role of antibodies (Abs) elicited against
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) following vaccination or infection. In
particular, we will examine the Ab Fc properties and functions that are not well understood and the Abs that are
present in blood and in saliva as a proxy of Abs at the mucosal site of virus entry. The proposed study is built
upon our published and preliminary results showing the detection of different immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes
against SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD in saliva vs plasma of convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccine
recipients. Interestingly, our preliminary data indicate a lack of correlation of spike-specific Ig isotypes in saliva
vs plasma from infected and vaccinated subjects. The data further show the binding of C1q, the first
component in the classical complement cascade, to Abs from both infected and vaccinated subjects. Notably,
the C1q binding activities of Abs in saliva vs plasma correlated poorly, offering the initial evidence for
differential Fc functions of mucosal vs circulating anti-spike Abs elicited by infection and vaccination.
 To investigate further the Fc properties and functions of Abs against SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize
that Fc isotype and glycosylation are the key determinants of Fc-dependent Ab functions in protection
against COVID-19. A research team that include research specialists with expertise in Abs and viral
immunology (PI: Catarina Hioe at JJP VAMC; collaborators: Susan Zolla-Pazner, Chitra Upadhyay, Ray
Alvarez at Mount Sinai School of Medicine/MSSM), an expert in mass spectrometry and glycan biology (Hui
Zhang at Johns Hopkins Univ), and an infectious disease clinician (Co-I: Juan Bandres at JJP VAMC) will work
together to test this hypothesis. We will leverage our extensive expertise in Abs against HIV envelope
glycoprotein and our experience investigating Ab responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the past year. In Aim 1,
we will collect longitudinal plasma and saliva samples to determine the isotypes and durability of Abs against
spike and RBD in different bodily fluids of ambulatory and hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy
uninfected recipients of COVID-19 RNA vaccines. Aim 2 will evaluate the glycan structures on the Fc regions
of Abs against spike from SARS-CoV-2-infected and vaccinated subjects. Aim 3 will assess the Fc-mediated
activities that these Abs mediate to destroy virus particles and virus-infected cells, i.e. complement
binding/activation and FcɣR-mediated signaling, cytotoxicity, and phagocytosis. Abs of different Ig isotypes and
with experimentally modified Fc glycans will also be examined for their Fc-dependent activities. The proposed
study will produce data critical to advance the development of improved Ab-based arsenals for diagnostics,
prophylactics, and therapeutics against COVID-19."

The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that a cerebellar-striatal circuit regulates satiety in humans.
Obesity currently affects 42% of U.S. adults, with projections that by 2030, 50% of U.S. adults will have obesity.
These trends forecast a parallel increase in risk of obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Behavior, emergent
from brain function, likely governs several primary sources of obesity, yet therapeutic intervention based on
known brain circuits has not yielded dramatic success, suggesting a need to identify and rigorously evaluate
neural circuits associated with appetite and food intake. We used a reverse-translational approach to identify the
cerebellum as a regulator of appetite and feeding behavior. Animal studies determined that this effect is due to
cerebellar regulation of food related reward activity in ventral striatum (VS). Our prior studies of this circuit in
humans have been observational. Rigorous examination of the causal role of this circuit in modulating reward-
related food intake in humans requires well-designed acute, mechanistic, state-of-the-art neuromodulation
studies. Our group has evidence that cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can selectively
modulate network function in cerebellar networks in healthy adults, and when applied therapeutically, can reduce
symptom severity in patient populations. Thus, given the nascent nature of human data collected to date, we will
integrate TMS and neuroimaging techniques to validate the role of the cerebellar-VS circuit in satiation in
humans. We hypothesize that TMS modulation of the cerebellar-VS circuit will elicit neural and behavioral
responses that are consistent with state-dependent cerebellar-induced satiation. These include increases in
cerebellar activation, reductions in VS activation, and reduced food reward behaviors and intake. This proposal
will innovatively combine cerebellar TMS with neuroimaging and behavioral measures of food-related reward
under varying appetitive states. We will study the acute impact of cerebellar TMS on the satiation response to
palatable food in neural systems and behavioral endpoints using a double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled,
mechanistic parallel trial involving cerebellar TMS neuromodulation in 150 healthy adults with BMIs spanning
the healthy weight to obese range. The approach, completed under fasted and fed states to identify state-specific
functioning of the cerebellar-VS circuit, will include functional MRI to ascertain neural reactivity to high-palatable
food in the cerebellum and VS, as measures of target engagement. Food reward behavior will be measured
using objective assessments and subjective ratings, in addition to ad libitum intake of palatable food. This
proposal has public health impact because it will provide a mechanistic understanding of how this novel
cerebellar-ventral striatal circuit functions to induce a reward-related satiation response in humans, which in turn
will allow development of obesity therapeutics that target these validated and novel neurobiological pathways."
10775884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter (NKCC2) is the main sodium transporter in the medullary thick ascending limb
(mTAL), and enhanced activity of NKCC2 has been linked to hypertension in animal models and humans. We
recently found mutant ACTN4—a cytoskeletal protein previously known to contribute to human podocyte
dysfunction and glomerular disease—leads to salt sensitive hypertension in a novel rat model. ACTN4 is
expressed in mTAL, and we found in our new adaptation of organ-on-chip technology, mTAL-on-chips, that
mutant ACTN4 contributes to increased sodium uptake within mTAL cells via enhancing NKCC2 activity. Our
long-term goal is to define the role of ACTN4 in regulating sodium homeostasis and blood pressure salt
sensitivity. The overall objective of this application is to determine the degree to which disease-causing mutant
ACTN4 influences sodium handling in mTAL. Our central hypothesis is that mutant ACTN4 alters the F-actin
cytoskeletal network, which in turn disrupts normal trafficking of NKCC2 within mTAL cells. This disruption of
trafficking leads to accumulation of NKCC2 on the apical membrane of mTAL cells, elevated sodium reabsorption
in mTAL, and ultimately salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 1 will determine the degree to which mutant ACTN4
increases salt-sensitivity in mTAL cells. We will use mTAL-on-chips seeded with wild type (WT) mTAL cells and
mutant ACTN4 mTAL cells. We will measure sodium reabsorption of mTAL cells in response to varying levels of
stress, including increasing sodium concentration, shear stress, and stretch. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism
by which mutant ACTN4 disrupts NKCC2 trafficking. We will measure differences between WT mTAL and mutant
ACTN4 mTAL cells in (1) the cell surface NKCC2 levels and (2) NKCC2 trafficking (endocytosis and exocytosis).
We will further measure whether these differences are amplified in response to varying levels of stress. Aim 3
will ascertain whether in vivo salt-sensitive hypertension associated with mutant ACTN4 is mediated by NKCC2.
We will examine the effect of mutant ACTN4 on pressure natriuresis. We will also assess the effect of inhibiting
NKCC2 with furosemide on acute natriuresis and blood pressure salt-sensitivity. The research proposed in this
application is innovative in that it integrates the novel mTAL-on-chip technology with advanced imaging and
whole animal physiologic studies to comprehensively delineate the mechanism by which mutant ACTN4 leads
to salt-sensitive hypertension. This research will provide strong evidence of a novel and essential mechanism of
sodium and blood pressure regulation performed by the cytoskeletal protein ACTN4."
10775895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Calcium is an essential regulator of muscle function and its dysregulation contributes significantly to the common
pathogenic signaling cascades that drive multiple striated muscle diseases including heart failure and muscular
dystrophy. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the major calcium storage site in muscle and SR calcium loading
is achieved by the SR calcium-ATPase (SERCA). Cardiomyocytes from human heart failure patients show robust
calcium defects including decreased systolic calcium transients, increased diastolic calcium, and SR calcium
leak, which contributes to impaired contraction/relaxation and can induce arrhythmias. Muscular dystrophy is a
family of genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes that serve a structural role in stabilizing the membrane
of skeletal muscle myofibers and cardiomyocytes. These mutations result in membrane instability, rupture, and
unregulated calcium influx leading to mitochondrial calcium overload and myocyte necrosis. Numerous studies
have shown that in heart failure and muscular dystrophy, calcium homeostasis can be restored by enhancing
SERCA activity or expression, thereby reducing cytosolic calcium and increasing SR calcium stores, resulting in
significant protection from disease. We recently discovered a novel SR membrane microprotein, DWORF, that
binds to SERCA and potently activates its calcium transport activity. In mice, DWORF overexpression in the
heart leads to robust SERCA activation, increased SR calcium uptake and SR calcium stores, faster cytosolic
calcium clearance, and increased cardiomyocyte contractility. Additionally, DWORF overexpression by cardiac-
specific transgene or adeno-associated virus (AAV9)-mediated gene delivery has proven to be cardioprotective
in experimental and genetic mouse models of heart failure. Notably, a significant limitation to previous AAV9-
DWORF gene therapy studies in mice has been the reliance on gene delivery in neonates to achieve meaningful
cardiomyocyte infectivity, as adult cardiac and skeletal muscle are not efficiently targeted by AAV9. A recent
breakthrough in the field was achieved with the development of the muscle-tropic MyoAAV capsid, which is
significantly more potent than any current AAV in transducing cardiac and skeletal muscle. Here we will leverage
the optimized MyoAAV system to comprehensively assess the therapeutic potential of DWORF gene therapy in
mouse models of striated muscle disease with diverse etiologies where calcium dysregulation plays a primary
role in disease pathogenesis. Aim 1 will use two distinct mouse models of heart failure, myocardial infarction and
pressure overload, which mimic different clinically relevant scenarios. Aim 2 will employ a robust model of
muscular dystrophy caused by combined loss of dystrophin and utrophin, and analysis will focus on both cardiac
and skeletal muscle. Aim 3 will utilize a newly developed humanized mouse model of monogenic phospholamban
disease, which presents with calcium defects that lead to ventricular arrhythmias. In all 3 Aims, we expect that
MyoAAV-DWORF gene therapy will protect from cardiac and skeletal muscle disease pathogenesis and these
findings will inform on future translational studies in large animals and human gene therapy trials."
10771110,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is abnormally phosphorylated and aggregates in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and AD-related dementias, leading to its impaired functionality. No disease modifying treatment
exists for these diseases, making them a significant healthcare priority. Though we have known for decades
that several modifications are intimately associated with sporadic disease and mutations in tau directly cause
inherited degenerative tauopathies, the precise molecular pathways engaged by pathological tau proteins to
actively cause neurodegeneration are unknown. This knowledge gap remains a significant and critical problem
that this proposal aims to address. Current thinking in the field suggests that disease-related tau modifications
exert toxicity by disruption of microtubules and/or by enhancing tau aggregation. However, evidence from our
group and others supports an alternative explanation. That is, tau acts to regulate signaling pathways and tau
toxicity is due to an aberration of this function. Using the isolated axoplasm from squid giant axons, we
discovered a functional signaling motif in the N-terminus of tau called the phosphatase-activating domain
(PAD) that activates a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1)-dependent signaling cascade. We also identified that
known pathological changes in tau (e.g. phosphorylation and oligomerization) alter tau’s structure leading to
aberrant PAD-dependent activation of this pathway and axonal toxicity. We propose to focus on determining
whether tau normally regulates PP1-dependent functions in neurons and on PP1-dependent pathways of tau
toxicity. Our central hypothesis is that, through a PP1-dependent mechanism, tau normally regulates neuronal
function and health, but in disease tau causes axonal, synaptic and/or neuronal toxicity through aberrations of
this mechanism. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that specific motifs within tau and PP1 are critical for the
interaction with and activation of PP1 by tau proteins. We will use a combination of point mutations/deletions to
map the specific domains in tau and PP1 isoforms that underlie tau’s ability to bind and activate PP1. In Aim 2,
we will test the hypothesis that tau localizes with PP1 in specific subcellular compartments where it regulates
PP1-dependent pathways. Here, we will use novel human tau-KI mouse primary neuron cultures and a
combination of super-resolution microscopy, subcellular fraction and other protein-protein interaction assays to
determine where in neurons tau and PP1 interact. Also, we will knockdown tau to determine its functional
relationship to multiple PP1-dependent pathways in neurons. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that disease
forms of tau drive toxicity via PP1-dependent mechanisms. We will use a novel tau pre-formed fibril seeding
model in the hTau-KI mice as well as the PS19 mutant tau mouse line to provide the critical in vivo translational
insights for the tau-PP1 relationship and how disease forms of tau lead to PP1-dependent toxicity. Together,
the proposed studies will fill critical gaps in our knowledge and will produce a significant impact by identifying
important physiological and pathological roles for tau in regulating PP1 in neurons."
10771112,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Repetitive elements (REs) compose ~45% of the human genome and are normally transcriptionally silenced,
although the mechanism has remained elusive. Through a high-content RNAi screen, we identified FBXO44 as
an essential repressor of REs in cancer cells. FBXO44 bound repressive H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at
the replication fork and recruited H3K9me3 methyltransferase SUV39H1, ubiquitin ligase CRL4RBBP4/7, and
histone deacetylase and chromatin-remodeling complex Mi-2/NuRD to transcriptionally silence REs post-DNA
replication. FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition transcriptionally activated satellite repeats and endogenous
retroviruses and retrotransposons in cancer cells, leading to DNA replication stress and stimulation of MAVS
and STING intracellular antiviral pathways to promote decreased tumorigenicity and enhanced immunotherapy
response. In silico analysis revealed that FBXO44 expression inversely correlated with DNA replication stress,
antiviral pathways, and cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration in human cancers. Importantly, we found
that FBXO44/SUV39H1 are dispensable for RE silencing in normal cells and their inhibition did not affect
H3K9me3 levels at REs or cell viability. Our hypothesis is that FBXO44/SUV39H1-mediated RE element
silencing is an epigenetic vulnerability of cancer cells that could potentially be targeted to induce viral
mimicry responses that inhibit tumor growth and progression and enhance the efficacy of certain cancer
therapies. In this proposal, we will perform preclinical studies that evaluate two potential therapeutic applications
of FBXO44/SUV39H1 pathway targeting in cancer: 1) prevention of metastatic relapse through stimulation of
intracellular antiviral pathways and NK cell recognition; and 2) enhancement of PARP inhibitor efficacy through
induction of extensive DNA replication stress at REs. Moreover, we will investigate the role of the CRL4RBBP4/7
ubiquitin ligase in FBXO44/SUV39H1-mediated RE silencing and evaluate its targeting for cancer treatment.
These studies could uncover a targetable epigenetic vulnerability of cancer cells whose inhibition induces viral
mimicry to prevent tumor growth and progression and enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics, undoubtedly
leading to a significant reduction in disease mortality."

ABSTRACT: The broad goal of the University of Miami's Advanced Workshops and Coaching Network (AWACN)
is to enhance the stage-specific career development skills of newly funded, underrepresented minority NIDDK
researchers at the postdoctoral and junior faculty levels. Continued development of professional skills will foster
early career success and lay the foundation for a strong and rewarding career in academic research. Program
scholars will participate in a 3-day workshop hosted by the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine.
Workshop curricula will be determined by pre-workshop needs assessment surveys allowing each workshop to
target needs of the scholar cohort and avoid overlap with strong programs at the scholars' home institutions.
Workshops will include didactic instruction, experiential activities and provide scholars with tangible outputs. All
workshops will be led by NIDDK-funded researchers at the University of Miami, or faculty with expertise in
transferable skills development. The latter will include effective negotiation tactics, strategies to combat
microaggression, and work/life balance. During the workshop each scholar will also meet their two coaches,
who, over the next two years, will provide guidance and support to the scholar. Coaches are all University of
Miami faculty with current research funded by NIDDK and who are trained mentors. One coach will match the
research type of the scholar (basic science, translational, or clinical research) and the other coach will provide a
broader perspective (e.g. a translational scientist will bring experience in moving basic science discoveries into
potential therapies). Coaches will meet remotely with their scholars approximately once a month by phone or
video conference to provide guidance on topics of the scholar's choice. Coaches will also strongly promote the
scholar's engagement in productive, substantive collaborations that lead to joint publications that then support
their recognition in their field and promote their career progression. The effectiveness of the workshops (Aim 1)
and extended coaching (Aim 2) will be evaluated using a outcome logic model. This model will assess the
effectiveness of the program components and resources on the scholars' career progression and satisfaction.
The evaluation process will also address whether an external workshop program and/or coaching network can
enhance career development programs at the home institution, and if present, counteract negative aspects of
the home institution's working environment. Dissemination of course content and anonymized results will include
publication on a dedicated website and publication of a peer-reviewed manuscript. Evaluation and dissemination
will be strengthened by working with the NIDDK Program Scientist collaborating on the project, and the Steering
Committee of Program Directors from all funded programs under RFA-DK-22-002 to administer a common
evaulation strategy and combine data from all programs into a comprehensive analysis and publication
describing these results."
10904775,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disparities in maternal-child health increase generationally because stress experienced by mothers can be
transferred to their children, with both biological and psychological consequences. Without clear understanding
of factors driving these disparate outcomes and without longitudinal assessments across racial and ethnic
groups, inequities will persist. The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program aims
to understand the effects of early environmental factors on child health and development, and therefore needs
a diverse cohort of children and their parents who represent the variety of U.S. populations, especially racial and
ethnic minority populations who often are at the intersection of socioeconomic adversity and social stressors
related to race/ethnicity. We propose to establish the Miami-ECHO cohort of racially and ethnically diverse
mothers, children, and fathers. We will recruit and retain a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of pregnant
women (N=1,250), their offspring, and the conceiving father from Miami-Dade County (MDC), Florida. In addition,
we will recruit and retain 60-80% of the cohort mothers into the ECHO preconception pilot protocol. MDC is a
minority-majority county with a population of 69.4% Hispanic/Latinos (including Afro-Caribbeans), 17.7% African
Americans, 12.9% Non-Hispanic Whites, 3% Asians, and 1.3% multi-racial individuals.to one of the most
ethnically and culturally diverse U.S. populations. MDC, however, is not yet represented in the ECHO Program.
Our diverse, multi-disciplinary team has access to the largest populations of pregnant women and those giving
birth in MDC, and to community-based infrastructures caring for the most vulnerable women in the region for
over 40 years. Furthermore, to advance ECHO science, we will address these aims: A) Examine social
environment and placental genome influences on children's neurodevelopment and global health. We
will determine whether the placental genome mediates the relationship between pre- and perinatal social
environment and children's neurodevelopment and global health during early and middle childhood; and identify
the interactive (gene x epigene x social environment) effects on children's neurodevelopment and global health
during early and middle childhood. B) Identify factors that protect against the effects of discrimination on
children's neurodevelopment and global health. We will distinguish the effects of maternal and paternal
discrimination – separately and in combination – on children's neurodevelopment and global health from early
to middle childhood; and determine the degree to which the social environment, social identity (race, ethnicity,
skin color, nativity), and social support mediate the effects of discrimination on children's neurodevelopment and
global health. C) Identify the effects of modifiable social determinants of health and access to family
planning during the pre-conception period on subsequent pregnancy morbidity and birth outcomes."
10907765,"ABSTRACT
Animal and epidemiological studies show that prenatal experiences (e.g., elevated environmental pollutants,
pregnancy complications, preterm birth, stress, racial discrimination) support the ‘developmental origins of
health and disease’ model in relating adverse maternal experiences to compromised fetal and child
development. Hypotheses suggest that the developmental window of plasticity for obesity programming
initiates in utero and extends through the first two years of life, underscoring the large impact that gestational
and early life exposures and corresponding targeted interventions may have on lifetime obesity risk. Current
obesity interventions may be ineffective because they target children or adults past the critical age when
developmental programming occurs. Because vulnerable populations are often the most impacted by exposure
to environmental stressors and poor health outcomes, it is critical that research studies include them.
Therefore, the overarching objective of our proposal is to increase the diversity of the ECHO Cohort. To
achieve this goal, we will recruit over 500 pregnant persons and their resulting offspring into ECHO from the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and implement the ECHO-wide protocol including specialized
components on Physical & Chemical exposures and child Obesity outcomes. Our proposed recruitment will
include 50% Black, 30% white/other and 20% Hispanic pregnant persons with half of the pregnant persons
(and their conceiving partners) also contributing to the preconception cohort. The racial and ethnic diversity of
the MUSC obstetrical population (i.e., 32% Black; 53% white; 12% Hispanic; and 2% Asian/Pacific Islander),
and large delivery population (i.e., over 3,000 annually) will facilitate meeting our recruitment goals. In 2022,
46% of deliveries at MUSC were covered by Medicaid and 5.5% were to Spanish speaking mothers, providing
further evidence of high social vulnerability in our study population. Because previous research has often been
conducted in urban areas, rural communities where many Blacks reside are often understudied. Hence, as a
rural state in the Deep South with poor birth outcomes and a socially vulnerable population, South Carolina’s
population is historically understudied and our contribution to ECHO will have a major impact. Our aims
pertaining to ECHO-wide analyses are (1) to determine the joint impact of prenatal exposure to chemical
mixtures and early gestational and life exposures (i.e., hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth) on
child obesity and metabolic health; (2) to identify racial/ethnic disparities in prenatal chemical exposures and
their sources (dietary choices/opportunities, use of consumer goods and personal care products, occupation,
air/water) among participants in the ECHO cohort; and (3) to determine the association of mixtures of pre-
conceptual and peri-conceptual chemical exposures measured in both partners with hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, preterm birth, and child obesity."
10892066,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During DNA replication, a cell must replicate not only its DNA, but also the nucleosomes that
package its genome. To meet this extremely high demand for rapid histone protein biosynthesis,
all eukaryotes coordinate high expression of replication-dependent (RD) histone gene clusters
during S-phase of the cell division cycle. Regulating the level of expression of RD-histone genes
during S-phase is important for maintaining genomic integrity and normal cell cycle progression,
as too many or too few histones lead to toxic effects such as enhanced DNA damage sensitivity
or cell cycle arrest. While the transcriptional activation of RD-histone genes has been
characterized, little is known about the negative regulation that occurs as cells exit S-phase or
the modulation of transcription that occurs during S-phase. My preliminary research has shown
the Drosophila protein Mute (a homologue of human Yarp/Gon4L) is a prime candidate for a
negative transcriptional regulator of RD-histone genes. I have found that loss of Mute uncouples
expression of RD-histone genes from S-phase in Drosophila embryos. I hypothesize Mute is both
restricting RD-histone expression to S-phase as well as regulating levels of expression during S-
phase. This proposal seeks to uncover the mechanisms through which Mute represses RD-
histone genes and how this repression is connected to the cell cycle. Using an interdisciplinary
approach, the mechanisms of Mute’s repression at both the cellular and molecular levels will be
explored using a combination of genomic, fluorescent imaging, genetic, and proteomic techniques
in the Drosophila model system. This project will enhance our understanding of the role of histone
gene regulation in metazoans and provide insight into the mechanisms that govern the regulation
of this highly conserved cellular process."
10748354,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with extremely high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and
substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the critical importance of risk detection in BDD. Negative affect
states - particularly anxiety and shame - are well-documented risk factors for suicide and substance use in
BDD, offering clear targets for risk detection and intervention. This K23 aims to develop and validate
unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of anxiety, shame, and general negative affect
states in BDD, using smartphone-based digital phenotyping. Passive (i.e., unobtrusive) smartphone
measurement of negative affect states will be based on GPS, accelerometer, and communication logs, used to
detect behavioral features of anxiety (avoidance, rituals), shame (social withdrawal, isolation), and general
negative affect (aggregated avoidance, rituals, withdrawal, and isolation features). We will collect passive and
active (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) smartphone data in 85 adults with BDD and will use
EMA ratings of negative affect as outcomes, to build and validate predictive statistical models from passive
data. We will also test the hypotheses that passive smartphone measures of negative affect states can
significantly predict next-day suicidal ideation and substance use in BDD, above and beyond common clinical
indices of risk. This project synthesizes the Candidate’s expertise in emotion-based risk for suicide in BDD with
her experience conducting smartphone research. Building from this foundation, this K23 will provide critical
new training in key areas to launch the Candidate’s independent research career: (1) digital phenotyping,
including statistical learning and longitudinal analysis; (2) EMA methods; (3) assessment of suicide and
substance use; (4) career development, including R01 writing; and (5) ethics of technology-based suicide and
substance use research. Training goals will be accomplished with stellar mentorship and institutional support at
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sabine Wilhelm, a leader in BDD and
clinical research, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, an expert in digital phenotyping
and its statistical approaches, and Dr. Michael Armey, an expert in EMA research of emotions and suicide, will
serve as co-mentors. Complementary guidance in EMA and substance use will be provided by the advisory
team: Drs. Bettina Hoeppner and A. Eden Evins. In line with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 will yield
scalable, unobtrusive tools to detect acute, modifiable risk factors for suicide and substance use in a high-risk
population. Moreover, negative affect states are transdiagnostic risk factors. As a next step to this proof-of-
concept K23, the Candidate will apply for an R01 to further validate passive mobile detection of negative affect
states and their ability to predict risk transdiagnostically. This program of research can enable (1) personalized
just-in-time interventions targeting high-risk affect states, to reduce suicide and substance use; (2) unobtrusive
monitoring of changes in risk; and (3) large-scale, ecologically-valid longitudinal research of risk processes."
10748422,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease (ND) that affects approximately 30,000
patients in United States and for which no therapies are available. HD is characterized by massive protein
aggregation, preferentially affecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum. Despite numerous studies
addressing the importance of MSN degeneration in HD pathology, very little is known about the molecular
mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein induces MSN death in HD.
Recent evidence demonstrated that the essential heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), responsible for the
expression of stress protective proteins, is inappropriately degraded in MSNs in HD. We hypothesize that
HSF1 degradation is a key pathway involved in MSN dysfunction and loss in HD and preventing its
degradation may constitute a potential therapeutic approach. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the
mechanism that leads to HSF1 degradation in MSNs, and determine if reversal of this process, even after
onset of HD symptoms leads to improved outcomes. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that inappropriate
accumulation of the protein p53 in MSNs controls the expression of components of the HSF1 degradation
pathway (protein kinase CK2α’ and E3 ligase Fbxw7), ultimately leading to loss of HSF1 and HD
symptomology. This pathway would be preferentially activated in MSNs due to the enhanced CAG somatic
instability observed in the striatum. To test this hypothesis, we will use molecular, pharmacological and genetic
manipulations in primary neurons and transgenic HD mice. The expected results will reveal the mechanism/s
by which MSNs become dysfunctional in HD and establish the basis for future understanding of the preferred
susceptibility of MSNs to mHTT.
Several studies have attempted to pharmacologically activate HSF1 as a therapeutic approach in HD, but they
failed in achieving long-term benefits. We propose that preventing HSF1 degradation may be a more effective
and long-lasting therapeutic strategy. In Aim 2 we will use pharmacological and genetic manipulations of
CK2α’ in HD mice to prevent HSF1 degradation at different time points during disease progression. These
studies will reveal the timeframe in which preventing HSF1 degradation is necessary to improve HD symptoms
and consolidate CK2α’ as a potential therapeutic target for HD. Changes in HSF1, p53 and CK2 are also
observed in other neurodegenerative diseases and therefore, our studies in HD may identify common HSF1
degradative mechanisms and therapeutic targets applicable to other NDs."
