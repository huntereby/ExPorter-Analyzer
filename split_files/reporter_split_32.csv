Progress in treating neurologic disease depends on the recruitment, retention, and support of a diverse cadre of
neurosurgery and neurology physician scientists (NSci). Our major goal is to increase the number of diverse
NSci residents who transition to independent academic careers, tackling complex neurologic questions with
translational impact. We will achieve this through early multidimensional support of trainees, acknowledging
cultural and scientific diversity that creates a stimulating, welcoming, and collaboration-fostering environment.
We will focus on early engagement in research training, individualized and enduring mentorship of the R25
scholars, and iterative program design, to foster the strongest, most diverse pool of NSci physician scientists.
To this end, we will establish an innovative R25 training program which extends beyond the architecture of the
residency training years, to increase the recruitment of diverse candidates, and ensure their retention and
successful transition to independent research careers. These innovations include: (1) integration with established
Stanford diversity pathway programs supporting socially excluded/underrepresented trainees (R25 DEI Team),
(2) Day 1 enrollment of NSci residents into an R25-foundational research training pipeline; (3) tiered, diverse,
cross-departmental leadership, functioning throughout the continuum of NSci training to ensure the success of
the R25 trainees; (4) increasing trainee independence through establishment of an R25-to-K Transition Team,
and (5) continuous improvement with outside feedback from an External Advisory Committee. This adaptive
R25 educational structure will identify, equip, and encourage a diverse group of NSci Residents
immersed in direct investigative study, increasing retention and reducing time to a mentored or
independent research award. Our active, engaged commitment to increasing the diversity of NSci residents
well prepared for independent research careers, directly benefits the trainees, patients, and scientific
communities we serve."

When programming a hearing aid, the amount of amplification necessary is adjusted to account for the
patient’s natural amount of external-ear amplification (EEA), provided by structures such as the pinna, concha,
and ear canal. Although two patients may exhibit identical, inner-ear hearing organ sensitivity (i.e. identical
severity of hearing loss indicated by their audiograms), their hearing aid amplification may be programmed
very differently, as their EEA can vary significantly depending on the unique shape and size of the external ear.
For example, smaller patients have smaller earcanals and exhibit higher EEA, because sound pressure level
increases as the space in which it resides decreases; thus, these patients require less hearing aid
amplification. Although norms exist for average-EEA in individuals age 1mo - adulthood (defined as >15 yr),
the best practice guideline is for audiologists to directly measure their patient’s individual EEA using
specialized probe-microphone equipment. Despite this gold-standard measurement method, 60-80% of
audiologists still use an automated, average-EEA estimate when programming hearing aid amplification,
because it saves time and money, even though it can yield amplification errors up to 20 dB. This significant
amount of error is likely to result in either poor audibility from under-amplification, or noise-induced hearing
injury from over-amplification, in addition to considerable dissatisfaction with the hearing aid. A major source of
error in the current, average-EEA predictions is that they are based on chronological age, around which there
is high variability in human body size (including the size and shape of the external-ear responsible) at
all stages of pediatric development, and in fully grown adulthood. Therefore, we believe that predictions
of average-EEA could be improved by using body height as the proxy measurement of EEA, instead of body
age. Updated and improved average-EEA predictions should be used in automated hearing aid programming
in both audiologist-fit hearing-aids and over-the-counter hearing aids, in order to reduce major amplification
errors, thereby improving hearing aid safety and audibility. We will test the hypotheses that 1) average
real-ear-to-coupler difference measurement predictions (a type of EEA measurement for hearing aids coupled
to earmolds) based on body height will yield statistically significant and clinically relevant accuracy
improvement over the current predictions based on body age, and 2) real-ear-unaided-gain (a type of EEA
measurement for hearing aids coupled to receiver wires and perforated domes) and body height will exhibit a
statistically significant correlation, thereby establishing new, normative data for use in open-fit hearing aid
programming. These analyses will be conducted in two cohorts; Specific Aim 1 will test these hypotheses in
the adult cohort (> 18 yr); body height, age, pinna size, and EEA will be analyzed cross-sectionally. Specific
Aim 2 will test these hypotheses in a pediatric/adolescent cohort (3 mo-15 yr); age, body height, pinna size, ear
canal size, and EEA will be analyzed using an accelerated, 4 yr longitudinal design."

Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) is a critically understudied form of AD associated with a more
aggressive clinical course, more “atypical” non-amnestic clinical presentations, more severe neuropathology
(particularly
neurofibrillary tangles), and increased heritability compared with its late-onset counterpart. At
present, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the spread of tau pathology and genetic risk factors
that predispose it.
Candidate Development and Environment: The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent investigator
with deep knowledge of multimodal neuroimaging techniques to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cognitive
dysfunction in AD and related dementias and to develop tools that help improve individual patients’ well-being.
With this K award, the candidate will extend his expertise in multimodal neuroimaging by gaining critical training
in longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), graph theory, and
analysis of gene expression in the brain. This new skill set will allow him to characterize the mechanisms of
disease progression in EOAD with unprecedented specificity. The candidate will analyze the rich multimodal
neuroimaging dataset collected in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS), the largest
and best characterized cohort of patients with sporadic EOAD to date. His mentor/advisory team consists of
world-renowned scientists throughout the United States with broad expertise spanning behavioral neurology,
cognitive, systems, and network neurosciences, and imaging genetics. The state-of-the-art resources and
facilities at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School will provide an ideal environment for
the candidate’s training and will foster his growth toward scientific independence.
Research Project: The proposed project aims to investigate the role of large-scale brain network connectivity in
the longitudinal spread of tau pathology in EOAD using novel graph theoretical methods, and to identify specific
genetic biomarkers that may confer vulnerability to the cortical spread of tau in this population via integrative
neuroimaging-transcriptomic analyses. Specific gaps in the literature will be filled by cross-sectionally
establishing the relationships between tau accumulation and intrinsic brain functional and structural connectivity
(Aim 1), validating the utility of brain connectivity in predicting longitudinal tau spread using directional graph
theory regression analysis (Aim 2), and identifying specific genes whose cortical expression is associated with
the topography of longitudinal tau spread (Aim 3) in EOAD. Knowledge gained from this project will facilitate the
inclusion of patients with EOAD in clinical trials by identifying novel imaging and genetic biomarkers sensitive to
clinical progression in this population."

Epilepsy is a severe neurological disease affecting more than 65 million people worldwide and is characterized
by unpredictable abnormal electrical discharges resulting in recurrent seizures. About one third of patients with
epilepsy suffer from intractable seizures that do not respond to anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Neurosurgical
interventions and neurostimulator devices are useful options for only a fraction of patients with drug-refractory
seizures, underscoring the urgent need to develop new therapies. One strategy with considerable promise is to
engraft new neurons to provide enhanced GABAergic inhibition in an activity-dependent manner. However, use
of fetal neurons for cell therapy is associated with practical and ethical issues. Therefore, to overcome such
hurdles, in our previous studies, we pioneered the transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived
medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-type human cortical interneurons (cINs) into epileptic mouse brains and
demonstrated their integration into dysfunctional circuitry, accompanied by the suppression of seizures and
comorbid behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, more recently, we have determined the optimal stage of
human cIN differentiation to ensure maximal integration into host circuitry as well as safety without risk of tumor
formation, and developed a method to efficiently generate these safe and highly migratory populations of
synchronized early postmitotic cINs from hPSCs in large quantities, bringing cell therapy for epilepsy one step
closer to reality. Furthermore, we have successfully tested the efficacy of human early postmitotic cINs in 2
different models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), observing >80% of seizure reduction. With these strong
previous studies, now we are ready to embark clinical translation of this novel and restorative therapy for
epilepsy patients with limited options. Thus, in this proposed study, we will scale up production of synchronized
early postmitotic cINs that are optimal for grafting under cGMP condition. For added safety, we will utilize well-
characterized HLA-edited hypoimmunogenic iPSCs to minimize the need for immunosuppression for off-the-
shelf use of human cINs. We will also extensively analyze the produced early postmitotic cINs’ phenotype,
efficacy, safety, tumorigenesis and biodistribution to seek IND approval. Once we obtain IND approval, we will
do a first-in-human clinical trial of early postmitotic cIN grafting with a primary goal of safety analysis, while also
checking efficacy as a secondary measure. This will be done in patients with intractable TLE who are candidates
for resection while they undergo intracranial EEG to identify the seizure focus without additional invasive steps.
Completion of these studies is pivotal for translating this experimental therapy into a viable therapeutic strategy
for intractable epilepsy."

Computational modeling and simulation continue to be popular in biomedical research. However, doubts
remain as to the reliability or trustworthiness of such efforts. We say that a model is credible for an application
if its predictions are trusted and useful. Although what constitutes a credible model depends on its intended
usage, many current models are not credible. For example, it has been shown that a vast number of published
models cannot even be easily reproduced. That is, recreating the results of a published study is either
impossible or very difficult to achieve. If a model cannot be reproduced, then its credibility is immediately
suspect. Moreover, during the COVID pandemic, there has been much discussion of the credibility and utility
of COVID models, with a great deal focused on the way COVID models were built and tested. With more and
more models finding their way into the clinic, being used by policymakers, and in pharmaceutical companies,
the credibility of biomedical models has become a pressing problem. We therefore feel it is very important that
we begin to consider a systematic approach to assessing the credibility of biomedical models that allows non-
experts (or even researchers outside their particular domain) a means to gauge the credibility of a given
biomedical model. Work over the last decade to improve model reproducibility is a natural first step towards
improving model credibility. The Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling has advanced the
reproducibility of biomedical models by developing the biosimulation portal, a service that provides access to
reproducible models across a wide range of biological domains, not just systems biology. However, even though
a model may be reproducible, the question still arises as to how credible is the model.
The goals of this project include: (1) Develop a model management system (MMS) which will be a repository or
simulatable and reusable model parts. Add sophisticated query systems and model decomposition capabilities;
(2) Develop a flexible import/export layer that can accommodate many of the ways that modelers build
models; (3) Create a series of credibility tools that can be used to assess various credibility metrics of models
either held in the MMS or provided by users directly. Technology from TR&D 1 will be used by TR&D 3 as well
as our CPs and SPs."
10780533,"TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY
Dynamic models are abstract specifications of systems, which simulators implement with
algorithms that update the systems’ state over time. Traditionally, biomedical simulations have
relied on models that utilize a single class of algorithm for the simulations’ duration. Specific
biological subsystems might be better suited for one method or another, and this has allowed
computational biologists to focus on those subsystems within the silos of fixed simulation
frameworks. To break these silos and address the challenges to reproducibility we developed the
BioSimulations platform, where simulators that implement a wide range of algorithms have
been containerized with a standard API into a quality controlled registry, and can be used for
reproducible online execution of models and sharing of results.
However, biology is multi-modal and multi-scale, with many heterogeneous processes operating
simultaneously and driving each other's dynamics. Because of this, biological simulations
increasingly require simulators that use multiple algorithms to handle different dynamic
processes. This approach is called hybrid simulation, integrative simulation, or co-simulation. It
has been used for multi-scale modeling, including whole-cell modeling, multi-cell modeling,
tissue models, and other complex biological models. While powerful, they have been primarily
developed ad hoc, are difficult to reproduce or expand upon, and are often hard-coded in
individual simulation platforms with a fixed set of pre-set algorithms.
The next step is to build on the foundation of BioSimulations with flexible and reproducible
definitions of composite simulations, which can be assembled through the use of software tools,
easily executed, and shared with others in the biomodeling community. We will expand
BioSimulations with an online portal for model composition, and add new tools for credibility
evaluation (with TR&D1) and model annotation (with TR&D2). This will allow users to more
easily build composite simulations of their own using reusable simulator modules, with tools
that let them inspect model elements, plug in new modules, execute compositions as multi-
algorithmic simulations, and evaluate their reproducibility and credibility. Driven by our
collaborative projects, we will exercise this new set of standards and tools with a series of
generic templates for several commonly-needed hybrid simulations and multi-cell simulation
methods. Users will be able to take these templates, load their own models and swap simulator
components as a way to iterate on model design and build upon prior work."

10771927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolic liver diseases are the second most common indication for a pediatric liver transplant. Hereditary
tyrosinemia type I (HT1) is a metabolic liver disease that results from FAH gene mutations causing a deficiency
in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the last enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. HT1 can cause death
within the first months of life and has an increased risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) by mid-childhood. Liver
transplant is the only cure for HT1. Although lifelong treatment with nitisinone to inhibit hydroxyphenylpyruvate
dioxygenase (HPD) upstream of FAH has improved outcomes, some patients are resistant to nitisinone, and
HCC and liver failure have occurred despite the drug. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new strategies to
treat HT1 and other metabolic liver diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing offers an unprecedented opportunity
to treat genetic diseases. Base editing, a CRISPR editing approach that does not introduce double-strand DNA
breaks, is a potentially safer mechanism to silence a gene or correct a mutation than CRISPR-mediated
nonhomologous end-joining and homology-directed repair (HDR). In utero gene editing has the potential to
increase editing efficiency by taking advantage of fetal properties–small size, immunologic immaturity,
abundance of proliferative progenitor cells–and treat a disease prior to birth and the onset of irreversible
pathology. The overall objective of this proposal is to cure HT1 via in utero base editing and HDR. Our central
hypotheses are that intrinsic fetal properties will allow for efficient in vivo base editing and HDR to rescue the
lethal phenotype in HT1 mice, and that base editing, focused on treating HT1, will work efficiently in humanized
models. Our hypotheses are based on our preliminary data in which we 1) efficiently target the fetal liver via viral
and nonviral approaches, 2) silence the Hpd gene and rescue the HT1 mouse phenotype via prenatal base
editing, 3) identify guide RNAs targeting the human HPD gene for silencing via base editing, and 4) rescue the
HT1 phenotype via base editing to correct the Fah mutation in adult mice. Our rationale for these studies is that
they will establish the safety and feasibility of prenatal gene editing for HT1 as a model for metabolic liver
diseases. To attain our objective, we will pursue the following aims: 1) silence the Hpd gene via prenatal base
editing to cure the HT1 mouse phenotype and evaluate HPD base editing in humanized mouse models in vivo,
2) correct the FAH mutation via prenatal base editing in the HT1 mouse and in vitro in an engineered human cell
line, and 3) compare the efficiency and safety of prenatal and postnatal CRISPR-mediated and endonuclease-
free HDR and their ability to rescue the HT1 phenotype. Our research is innovative in the prenatal timing of novel
CRISPR and non-CRISPR gene editing approaches for HT1 and the study of HT1 base editing in humanized
models. The significant contribution of this work will be to support a prenatal gene editing approach that could
yield a one-shot, long-term therapy that cures HT1 and which could be expanded to treat other genetic disorders."
10771930,"Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination
of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the
proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions
between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions
between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional
significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor
responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in
various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned
behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition,
emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program
constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal
cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the
cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding
which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven
feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This
conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum
and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site
electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be
combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and
prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The
proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms
underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to
the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many
contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of
emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum
interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex."
10772080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traditionally, diabetes is defined as decreased insulin action resulting in impaired glucose homeostasis.
However, inappropriate secretion of glucagon also contributes to the hyperglycemia in diabetes. Blocking
glucagon action lowers blood glucose, but also leads to hyperglucagonemia with α cell proliferation and
hyperplasia. We demonstrated that this is due to high blood levels of amino acids resulting from impaired
amino acid catabolism in liver (gluconeogenesis). These studies demonstrated a classical endocrine feedback
loop, the liver-islet α cell axis. As part of our K01 funded investigations, we discovered that high levels of
arginine are required for the effects of high amino acid levels on α cell proliferation and function. We identified
SLC7A2 (CAT2) is the major arginine transporter in pancreatic islet α cells. Using global CAT2 knockout mice,
we found that loss of CAT2 results in protection from α cell hyperplasia and a complete loss of glucagon
secretion even in response to strong depolarizing agents. This suggests that CAT2 is playing an important role
in α cells beyond affecting membrane polarization as had been previously proposed as a mechanism for
arginine-stimulated secretion. Our current objective is to define the mechanisms of arginine-stimulated α cell
proliferation and secretion. Under the support of this R01 in Aim 1, we will characterize changes in the α cell
when CAT2 expression is lost using α cell specific targeted deletion, including α cell proliferation and mass,
glucagon secretion, Ca2+ dynamics, and gene and protein expression. We will also test if the heterodimeric
amino acid exchanger LAT2 (SLC7A8/SLC3A2) is required for α cell proliferation and function. In Aim 2, we
will examine a novel putative arginine cell surface binding protein called TM4SF4 that is selectively and
robustly expressed on pancreatic α cells. We will fully characterize TM4SF4 arginine binding kinetics, protein
binding partners in α cells, effects on arginine transport, and regulation of α cell proliferation and function. An
important feature of our work is that we will translate our discoveries made in mouse islets using human islets.
These studies will provide new insights into normal α cell function and how α cells could be targeted to repair
dysregulated glucagon secretion in diabetes."

The proposed Pacific Center for Genome Research (PCGR) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) aims
to grow and support Genomic Research workforce at UHM, a Minority Serving Institution (MSI), which has a
mission to serve historically underrepresented population in biomedical research, namely, Native Hawaiians and
other Pacific Islanders. UHM awards doctorate degrees in the health professions and the sciences related to
health. We will support a multi-investigator, interdisciplinary team to develop two interrelated and highly
innovative genomic research projects, along with three cores, namely, Administrative Core, Genomic Workforce
Development Core, and Community Engagement Core. Our two projects address critical issues in genomics
including: methods development; genomics of disease; genomic data science and computational genomics; and
genomics and health equity. Along with its scientific goals, the proposed UHM PCGR will substantially expand
the pool of diverse genomic scientists and researchers at UHM who can perform innovative genomics research
by providing didactic, practicum and research activities and experiences that are aligned with the research
projects. Through the proposed initiative, genomic research capacity will be increased in UHM. The strength and
diversity of the genomics research workforce and thinkforce will be enhanced at all career levels of
undergraduate students, master and PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty members. We will
identify the most motivated faculty and early stage investigators, particularly those from underrepresented
backgrounds, for careers in genome research. We will identify senior faculty to serve on mentoring teams for
new and early-stage investigators, and implement a Team-Science Mentoring Bootcamp for personalized
education and skills training. We will enhance, consolidate and sustain core facilities and resources for genome
research. We will implement objective criteria and metrics to evaluate core needs and usage, and core-
dependent research productivity. Innovation and creativity will be amplified by bringing new researchers and
novel ideas into the genomics. Participation of underrepresented populations and underserved communities that
experience health disparities (including understudied Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos,
and importantly, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders) will be increased in genomics research.
Institutional investments will ensure the sustainability of the proposed PCGR to provide the infrastructure and
resources for a new era of research excellence on the science of genome research. We also appreciate the
opportunity to become a member of the consortium together with other Centers funded under this FOA and the
companion FPA, and develop best practices and opportunities for synergy among Centers. We are excited to
share resources, data, and experience we accumulate in our UHM Center to Centers of other MSIs."
10749909,"Project Summary/Abstract
Diabetes affects up to 40% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diabetes
management in the context of existing ESRD is challenging due to alterations on glucose
metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and also renal clearance of several medications. Thus, most
patients with diabetes on dialysis are treated with insulin therapy, resulting in increased risk for
hospitalizations for hypoglycemia, mortality, length-of-stay and hospitalization costs at a national
level. In many instances, clinicians and patients need to make treatment decisions based on few
point-of-care blood glucoses (POC BG) per day, which fails to detect asymptomatic and
nocturnal hypoglycemia and are not a good indicator of the 24-hours glycemic excursions.
Novel factory-calibrated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices have shown improved
accuracy and could fill the critical need for better glycemic monitoring systems in dialysis
patients. In this proposal, the PI, Dr. Galindo, will use CGM (Aim 1a) to examine the prevalence
of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and estimate glycemic variability patterns among patients with
type 2 diabetes (DM2), treated with insulin and receiving hemodialysis, (Aim 1b) to assess the
accuracy of the CGM in this specific cohort, (Aim 2a) to assess the efficacy of real-time CGM
data in preventing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and (Aim 2b) to examine the relationship
between glycemic variability and inflammatory/oxidative stress markers in patients participating
in Aim 2a. We anticipate that this study will provide novel insights into the glycemic exposure
patterns among dialysis patients and will provide preliminary data for future outcomes-based
studies determining the best glycemic targets for this group. Dr. Galindo has created a
multidisciplinary mentorship team with track record of NIH funding, led by Dr. Umpierrez, with
expertise in glucose monitoring and research methodology, and Dr. Tuttle, who is an expert on
clinical and translational studies in diabetic kidney disease. His scientific advisory committee
includes experts in biostatistics and bioinformatics (Dr. Limin Peng, PhD), and in CGM
technology for (Dr. Beck). Dr. Galindo will test the proposed aims within the vast resources
available at Emory University - a world-known research institution. The career development plan
includes didactic classes, mentored-based training on clinical research and hands-on
experience on CGM use and large database analyses. This innovative proposal and formal
training plan, will provide Dr. Galindo with the bases for future R01 applications, and an
independent career in patient-oriented clinical research."
10749911,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preventing kidney stone progression remains a serious obstacle in public health, despite advances unravelling
the underlying mechanisms of stone formation. Kidney stone disease, often along with excruciating pain, is highly
prevalent around the globe, affecting nearly 12% of the world population. In the United States, the estimated
lifetime prevalence of kidney stone disease is approximately 10.6% in men and 7.1% in women. Following their
initial episode, stone formers are at higher risk for recurrent stone formation, with more than 50% experiencing
a recurrence within 10 years, reflecting the inadequacies of current prevention regimens. In addition, the
formation of stone disease is strongly associated with long-term complications of chronic kidney disease and
end-stage renal disease, along with significant morbidity, mortality as well as burden of health care cost.
 In response to PA-20-185, the overarching goal of this proposal is to maximize the efficacy of preventive
strategies against kidney stone disease progression by developing clinical prediction tools as well as
computational algorithms and software. More specifically, we propose novel evidence-accumulation-driven
methods (1) to develop patient-level risk prediction models for kidney stone disease progression accounting for
subtypes of stone conditions; and (2) to identify modifiable risk factors for stone disease progression by
integrating historically existing prediction models into new EHR or registry datasets. We will apply and validate
the proposed methods to real-world data, including the UTSW Mineral Metabolism Stone Registry, the PUSH
trial conducting by the Urinary Stone Disease Research Network (which is a clinical research network funded by
NIDDK), and the Swiss Kidney Stone Cohort.
 The success of this project will fill the knowledge gap of kidney stone disease progression, and lead to a
predictive toolbox to inform clinicians on the risk of kidney stone progression, thereby facilitating timely clinical
decision-making and implementation of targeted strategies to prevent or reduce stone disease progression."
10749925,"Project Summary/Abstract
b-lactam antibiotics have a broad spectrum of anti-bacterial activity including important
Gram-positive and negative pathogens. b-lactams are the most widely used antibiotics and include
penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. Bacterial resistance to these drugs, however, has
been steadily increasing, significantly reducing treatment options. The most common mechanism of
resistance is b-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis, which renders the antibiotics ineffective.
Carbapenems are used as antibiotics of last resort. The increasing use of these drugs, however, has
led to the emergence of carbapenemase enzymes. This group includes the KPC-2 b-lactamase that
effectively hydrolyzes nearly all b-lactam antibiotics and has spread globally to multiple species of
Enterobacteriaciae. K. pneumoniae strains producing KPC are a particular concern, as the mortality
rate for infections from such strains is 30-40%. The design of new antibiotics that escape hydrolysis
by KPC enzymes is a challenge. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the catalytic
mechanism and basis for substrate specificity of the enzyme and how this relates to inhibitor design.
This, in turn, requires an understanding of the affinity of binding of the antibiotic/inhibitor as well as
the rates of the chemical steps. Further, it is necessary to understand how the structure and
dynamics of the enzyme influence drug binding and hydrolysis. Finally, for future antibiotic design, it
is important to understand how changes in antibiotic structure impact binding affinity and the rates of
chemical steps. We propose to achieve these goals with KPC-2 and variants of the enzyme that have
an extended substrate profile or provide resistance to the antibiotic/inhibitor combination
ceftazidime/avibactam. While there has been extensive characterization of b-lactamase structure
and steady-state enzyme kinetics, there is a large gap in understanding the rates of individual steps
of b-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of b-lactam antibiotics. We will address this gap by determining
the chemical and structural basis of KPC-2 catalysis with a combination of pre-steady state kinetic,
X-ray crystallographic, and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Aim 1 will provide a
mechanistic and structural basis for the hydrolysis of b-lactam antibiotics by the KPC-2 enzyme. The
studies in Aim 2 will characterize the kinetic and structural basis of increased hydrolysis of the
extended-spectrum cephalosporin, ceftazidime, by drug-resistant KPC variants. Finally, Aim 3 will
determine the structural and mechanistic basis of action of KPC-variant enzymes that are resistant to
the ceftazidime/avibactam inhibitor combination. Our multidisciplinary approach is expected to
answer these questions and lead to new concepts and tools to address the problem of
antibiotic/inhibitor resistance."

of persons living with dementia, survey research, and health workforce research. The goal of the NDWS data
infrastructure is to allow researchers and policymakers to ask and answer scientific questions to help build the
workforce of clinicians and other professional care providers required by the growing population of persons
living with dementia in the U.S. The core of NDWS will be four surveys that reflect key elements of the
professional dementia care workforce in the U.S.: Community Clinicians, Nursing Home Staff, Assisted Living
Staff, and Home Care Staff. In addition to these surveys, the NDWS team will develop a variety of additional
data sources that can be linked with the surveys in order to maximize the scientific potential of the surveys.
The Administrative Core will be responsible for the overall organization, management, decision-making, and
communication for NDWS, including coordinating knowledge dissemination activities to ensure that the
research community is aware of the tremendous new data infrastructure that will be created by this project.
The Administrative Core will provide oversight and consultation to each of the Cores to ensure that scientific
objectives are met and that there is optimal utilization of resources. Specifically, the Administrative Core will: 1)
Administer, manage, and integrate all elements of the NDWS cooperative team; 2) Coordinate and integrate all
elements of the NDWS data products; 3) Develop and disseminate data products, guidance materials, and
training opportunities to ensure full and timely use of the four NDWS surveys and available linked data; and 4)
Coordinate stakeholder engagement—including persons living with dementia, their caregivers, dementia

10782139,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly resistant and uniformly fatal despite current therapeutic efforts. Intra-tumoral
malignant reprogramming evolution of GBM stem cells (GSCs) towards a highly resistant and invasive
mesenchymal-like (MES) phenotype has emerged as a leading hypothesis for GBM lethality. Unfortunately, there
are currently no therapeutic strategies that address malignant reprogramming in GBM. Our long-term goal is to
develop such therapies. The current proposal is significant in that it presents a potential therapeutic approach
that targets malignant reprogramming of GSCs to improve GBM survival. It builds upon our validation of the
mechanistic underpinnings of BIRC3/STAT3 signaling in malignant reprogramming of GSCs; and also, from our
published works that have uncovered novel functions of BIRC3 in GBM resistance; GBM survival; GBM stemness
reprogramming; GBM regional MES phenotype; and hypoxia survival adaptation. A notable and novel preliminary
mechanistic finding was that interaction between BIRC3 and STAT3 was essential for nuclear translocation of
this complex, and activation of downstream MES target genes. Using two distinct BIRC3-centered proteomic
profiling approaches, we identified P70S6K1 (S6K1) as the critical upstream kinase regulator of BIRC3/STAT3
mediated MES reprogramming in GSCs. Further, we have demonstrated the preliminary efficacy of targeting
S6K1/BIRC3/STAT3 signaling axis to preventing MES reprogramming and improving survival in PDX models
through a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches. Utilizing a combination of patient-derived
GSCs models, patient tissues, and state-of-the-art techniques, our objective is to further understand and
optimally target S6K1/BIRC3/STAT3 signaling axis in GBM. Our central premise is that S6K1/BIRC3/STAT3 axis
is a critical regulator of malignant reprogramming in GBM; and we hypothesize that combinatorial targeting this
axis will improve GBM outcomes. In Aim 1, we will examine the cooperative roles of S6K1 and BIRC3/STAT3
complex in propagating malignant reprogramming in GBM. In Aim 2, we will investigate the feasibility of
combinatorial pharmacologic targeting of S6K1/BIRC3 in GBM. In Aim 3, We will evaluate synergy between
S6K1/BIRC3 axis inhibition and current GBM therapies-Temozolomide (TMZ)/Radiotherapy (RT). Collectively,
these proposed studies will provide further insights into novel clonal evolution reprogramming mechanisms in
cancer stem cells that would permit development of therapies that effectively target malignant clonal divergence
in GBM and other cancers."
10775759,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the causal interactions in large neural ensembles is key for developing techniques to alter
cognitive behavior through targeted manipulation of the brain. This is a challenging goal because commonly
used methods for recording neural responses in the human brain do not provide information about physical
connections of neurons and allow only extremely sparse sampling of neurons in a circuit (typically <1%). Here,
we develop an innovative path forward using a multi-disciplinary approach that combines recent theoretical and
experimental advances by the two PIs (Kiani and Mazzucato). In Aim 1, we introduce a novel theoretical
framework to infer a map of causal functional connectivity (CFC) based on sparse sampling from neurons in a
circuit. Our framework successfully recovers the structure of functional interactions, identifies hub neurons in
the circuit, and has multi-scale properties that make it applicable on a variety of data, ranging from spiking of
individual neurons to aggregated spiking of clusters of neighboring neurons to local field potentials. In Aim 2,
we test if the CFC inferred from a population of simultaneously recorded prefrontal neurons successfully
predicts how microstimulation perturbs neural activity in the circuit. Specifically, we show the existence of hub
neural clusters, identified through CFC, whose microstimulation has large and predictable impacts on the
population response dynamics. Finally, in Aim 3, we explore if the CFC and perturbation effects at rest predict
how microstimulation alters behavior during a perceptual decision-making task. We hypothesize that resting
CFC combined with the population activity prior to microstimulation successfully predicts the effect of
microstimulation both on the circuit activity and the behavior. The approach, data and analyses proposed in
each of these aims are novel and the combination will provide a practical solution for a long-standing problem
in systems neuroscience."
10953888,"Project Summary
 The proposed project is a clinical trial of a mindfulness-based neurofeedback (mbNF) intervention used to
augment Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills group training in adults with borderline personality disorder
(BPD). DBT is the best-evidenced treatment for BPD. Its full implementation involves up to 20 hours per week
of clinical contact for 6-12 months. Recent studies have shown that weekly brief DBT skills groups (DBTsg)
also provide clinical benefit for people with BPD. Here, we propose to amplify DBTsg training with mbNF.
Mindfulness is a foundational skill for DBT that is emphasized throughout each DBT module. Our aim is to
strengthen the ability of subjects to practice mindfulness effectively, and thereby to amplify the therapeutic
benefits of DBTsg. In our study, people with BPD will enroll, participate in a real-time fMRI mbNF intervention,
and subsequently participate in DBT. The mbNF intervention involves engaging in mindfulness meditation
while receiving feedback on how well one's brain patterns reflect a focused mindful state in which the fronto-
parietal control network (FPCN: controls cognitive focus) has high activity while the default mode network
(DMN: associated with less mindful brain state) has low activity. We hypothesize that mbNF will strengthen the
brain circuitry supporting mindfulness and thereby amplify the clinical benefits obtained in the DBTsg. Our past
studies using mbNF have demonstrated that it decreases hyperconnectivity within the DMN, increases
anticorrelations between the DMN and FPCN, increases connectivity between frontal control regions and
amygdala, improves measures of state mindfulness, and yields clinical benefits in neuropsychiatric
populations.
 The proposed study adopts a randomized, double-blind trial design to examine whether mbNF in patients
with BPD induces the expected changes in DMN connectivity (decreased internal connectivity and increased
anticorrelations to FPCN). We will also test whether mbNF amplifies clinical efficacy of DBT. Efficacy on both
brain and clinical measures will be determined via comparison to a control group that receives yoked sham
feedback and DBT. Importantly, the persistence of training effects will be monitored over several months.
 Neurofeedback naturally supports a closed loop intervention development cycle in which neuroscientific
and clinical knowledge develop together. The proposed study would leverage this approach in the
development of novel therapeutic options for BPD. It will inform our understanding of the neural substrates
supporting clinical efficacy of DBT in BPD and could lead to development of the first neuroscience-based
treatment option for patients with BPD."
10953891,"While the cardiac kinome is comprised of several hundred kinases, the vast majority of the literature is
focused on only a few kinases. Indeed, the function of numerous highly expressed cardiac kinases, many
of which may be potential therapeutic targets, are unexplored. In order to identify novel cardiac kinase(s)
potentially involved in HF development, we employed a combined transcriptome and bioinformatics
approach (Expression2Kinases (X2K)). This integrated approach enabled us to discover the critical role of
serine-threonine kinase Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2) in cardiomyocyte (CM)
biology. Specifically, we employed three different mouse models and AAV9-mediated gene therapy
approaches to define the CM-specific role of HIPK2 and underlying mechanisms. Since there was no
literature connecting HIPK2 to cardiac biology, these studies were entirely novel. HIPK2 has been strongly
implicated in multiple organ fibrosis. However, the role of HIPK2 in fibrotic remodeling of the ischemic
heart is entirely unknown. Herein, we aim to define the role of HIPK2 in adult heart fibroblast (FB) biology
and fibrotic remodeling in the ischemic heart. As a first step towards this goal, we have generated
inducible conditional FB-specific mouse models (FB-HIPK2-KOs driven by periostinMCM and TCF21MCM).
Our preliminary studies suggest that FB-specific deletion of HIPK2 leads to excessive fibrosis and
accelerated cardiac dysfunction post-MI. At the cellular/molecular level, adenovirus-mediated expression
of HIPK2 (Ad-HIPK2) reduced the pro-fibrotic TGF-β1-mediated SMAD-2/3 activation and myofibroblasts
transformation. Therefore, we hypothesize that HIPK2 exerts a critical break on fibrotic remodeling by
inhibiting the canonical TGF-β1-SMAD-3 signaling. The preliminary data strongly support our overall
hypothesis that HIPK2 is a critical negative regulator of FB activation and adverse myocardial fibrotic
remodeling in the diseased heart. Specific aims are designed to critically examine the role of HIPK2 in
cardiac FB biology and fibrotic remodeling of the ischemic heart. The proposed PeriostinMCM and
TCF21MCM models are widely accepted as the strongest tools available for FB-specific in vivo gene
targeting. Furthermore, throughout the proposal, a wide range of in vitro assays have been incorporated
to gain mechanistic insights into the in vivo findings. Thus, the proposed studies are of high significance,
not only by contributing translationally-relevant information to manage ischemic cardiac injury but also by
providing novel mechanistic insights into cardiac pathophysiology."
10766680,"Screening of prospective parents to determine if their offspring are at risk for potentially devastating heritable
conditions with genetic carrier screening has resulted in measurable decreases in the number of newborns
affected by severe recessive disorders. Although professional societies such as the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Medical Genetics advocate for genetic carrier
screening to be done prior to pregnancy (preconception), access to preconception genetic carrier screening
remains low and inequitable. This is because implementation of carrier screening in a diverse national
population is complicated and requires 1) understanding the barriers and facilitators of screening at all levels of
healthcare delivery, 2) recognizing patient preferences for test delivery, and 3) clarifying potential personal
health implications of carrier screening. This award will be used to address these three gaps in our
understanding of preconception genetic carrier screening. First, I will interview key informants with experience
at all levels of healthcare delivery about their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to implementing
preconception carrier screening programs. Second, I will systematically elicit patient preferences about how
genetic carrier screening should be delivered using a discrete choice experiment. The discrete choice
experiment will consist of a web-based survey in which different attributes of how preconception carrier
screening is offered are varied and prospective patients must choose their preferred screening method. This
survey will be administered to two separate cohorts of women of reproductive age to encourage a diversity of
responses. Finally, I will use phenome-wide association study methods to investigate whether carriers of
autosomal recessive disease are at high risk of other adult diseases. I will focus on CFTR, HBB, and GBA,
which are implicated in the autosomal recessive disorders cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Gaucher
disease, respectively. This study will generate key pilot data that will be used to design testable implementation
strategies to enable widespread use of preconception carrier screening. These strategies and their impact on
patient care will subsequently be tested in a randomized clinical trial through a future grant application."
10766773,"SUMMARY
The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for motor control and instrumental learning. In particular, classic lesion
studies have demonstrated that different regions of the striatum, the major BG input nucleus, are
associated with distinct aspects of action selection and learning: the dorsomedial striatum is responsible
for action-outcome learning and action selection based on outcome expectancy, whereas the dorsolateral
striatum is responsible for the development of habits and behavioral automaticity. There is also growing
consensus that maladaptive instrumental learning and performance contribute to numerous disorders
such as addiction and schizophrenia that also implicate the BG. Although recent studies have begun to
show a key role for corticostriatal plasticity in instrumental learning and habit formation, the detailed circuit
mechanisms remain unclear. The overall aim of this proposal is to determine the circuit mechanisms in
the BG underlying instrumental learning and performance. We will use a integrative approach, combining
intersectional strategies to target defined neuronal populations and pathways and precise behavioral
assays to quantify learning and behavior. To monitor and manipulate neural activity of defined cell
populations, we will use in vivo calcium imaging, optogenetics, and transgenic mouse lines that make it
possible to target the key neuronal populations and pathways in the BG. To assess the content of
learning and quantify behavior continuously, we will use established behavioral assays from instrumental
conditioning combined with 3D motion capture. Four aims are proposed. Aims 1 and 2 will determine the
contribution of the direct (striatonigral) pathway and indirect (striatopallidal) pathways in different striatal
regions to instrumental learning and performance. Aims 3-4 will determine the contributions of distinct
corticostriatal pathways (intratelencephalic and pyramidal tract) to instrumental learning and
performance. Results from proposed research can shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying goal-
directed actions and habit formation, and how dysfunctions in the BG circuit mechanisms can result in
key symptoms of multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders."
10766780,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell-to-cell variability provides a strategy by which cells can explore diverse states; little is known,
however, about the regulatory motifs that stabilize particular states into cell subsets that enable
diverse functions within a population. Macrophages, cells of the innate immune system, provide
an ideal experimental system to study the regulation of cell subsets, because they transiently
adopt polarization states (i.e., tailored sets of molecules) to meet changing functional demands in
tissues. However, the polarization state adopted to perform one task is often suboptimal for–or
even in opposition to–performing other tasks, raising the question of how macrophages respond
to conflicting microenvironmental cues. Our recent work suggests that cell-to-cell variation in
mutually inhibitory transcription factor (TF) networks increases macrophage functional diversity
and enables them to meet functional demands encoded by conflicting cues. The overall objective
of this proposal is to define intracellular and extracellular signaling–TF networks that regulate
heterogeneous pro-inflammatory (e.g., in response to LPS+IFN-γ) vs. anti-inflammatory (e.g., in
response to IL-4) macrophage subsets and ultimately coordinate a coherent functional response.
Our central hypothesis is that mutually inhibitory networks establish macrophage pro- vs. anti-
inflammatory subsets that are coordinated via context-dependent mechanisms. To test this
hypothesis, we will integrate single-cell measurements with mathematical modeling to determine
if mutual inhibition and collective sensing are important network motifs for harnessing cell-to-cell
variability and organizing appropriate polarization states to meet functional demands in tissues.
Achieving the proposed aims would provide an alternative way to describe the macrophage
polarization spectrum in innate immunity, by conceptualizing it as a set of functional cell subsets
that emerge from multiple competing network motifs. The proposed research is innovative
because we will measure single-cell responses after co-stimulation with conflicting environmental
cues–specifically, cues that have known mechanisms of regulatory cross talk and cell-cell
communication–in order discover new regulatory mechanisms and establish new frameworks
describing macrophage functional diversity. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to have broad translational potential to identify therapeutic targets that more specifically
alter macrophage functional states in vivo to treat conditions characterized by dysregulation of
macrophage functions."
10766781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain affects up to one third of the United States population, and the reliance on opioids to treat chronic
pain has contributed substantially to the opioid epidemic. Developing alternative pain therapies is critical to
reducing the use of opioids, and the phyto-cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) is a promising candidate. We have
shown that CBD has the ability to reduce chronic neuropathic pain-like responses in mice over 3 weeks.
Terpenoids (eg beta-caryophyllene), also found in the cannabis plant, are a potential second class of
pharmacologically active compounds in cannabis with possible analgesic benefits, although their
pharmacodynamic properties in vitro and in vivo are poorly understood. Likewise, there is an incomplete
understanding of how CBD and terpenoids produce anti-nociception, by themselves or combined (“entourage”),
and their supraspinal neuropharmacological mechanisms of “pain control” remain unknown. The proposed
experiments will first test whether specific combinations of CBD and terpenoids can produce short-term
inflammatory and long-term neuropathic antinociception without tolerance. We will then establish the
action of CBD and terpenoids in a critical brain nucleus for pain, the basolateral amygdala. Finally, we will
determine the pharmacological and biochemical signaling profiles of CBD and terpenoids in vitro and in
vivo. In Aim 1, we will use mixtures of CBD and terpenoids, investigator administered as well as in our gelatin
self-administration model, and measure both consumption and pain scores after partial sciatic nerve ligation to
determine if CBD and/or terpenoids provide analgesic benefit over protracted periods of pain. We will also verify
that these mixtures are not inherently rewarding, which is critical for substance abuse liability. In Aim 2, we will
test whether the amygdala is a critical brain circuit site for CBD/terpenoid analgesic action using single cell
calcium imaging of amygdalar neurons during pain states, in parallel with local injections of CBD and terpenoids
into the amygdala to produce analgesia. Further, we will knock out cannabinoid receptors and other putative
sites of CBD/terpenoid action within the BLA to establish necessity of each in producing behavioral and
physiological responses. In Aim 3, we will use in vitro and in vivo systems to determine the important biochemical
features of CBD and terpenoid action at their putative receptor targets. We will measure cellular signaling activity
via dynamic mass redistribution (DMR), MAP Kinase signaling, and the generation of reactive oxygen species.
These aims will inform public health about the benefits and risks of long-term cannabidiol/terpenoid usage, as
well as providing crucial mechanistic insight that will help develop and understand whether tailored medicinal
cannabis approaches for chronic pain can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit."

Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue caused by mutations in the fibrillin-
1(FBN1) gene. These mutations cause increased vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) apoptosis, increased
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, excessive elastin degeneration and collagen overexpression;
weakening the vascular architecture, impair hemodynamic regulation, and ultimately leading to severe vascular
complications. Primary cells, tissue explants, and transgenic mouse models suffer from insufficiencies that
inhibit development of novel insights into disease pathogenesis or potential therapeutics; warranting new
modeling platforms. Recent advances in biomaterials have generated vascular grafts that mimic properties of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the natural vasculature. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are an
ideal, patient specific renewable cell source that provides an avenue to study how genetic diseases effect cell
mechanobiology, signaling and function to better development therapeutics. Here, using a natural fibrin-based
vascular graft and hiPSCs from patients with Marfan Syndrome, we aim to: (1) fully characterized both ECs
and contractile vSMCs from hiPSCs derived from Marfan patients, (2) study the responses of hiPSC-ECs to
shear force and hiPSC-vSMCs to circumferential strain, (3) study the impacts of mechanical forces (i.e. shear
force and circumferential strain) and paracrine signaling in a co-culture model, specifically reactive oxygen
species(ROS), on vSMC phenotype and rate of graft degradation using the fibrin-based vascular graft. Our
multidisciplinary approach underpinning this project will elucidate key mediators of MFS disease progression
towards early detection and therapeutic targets."
10745701,"Progressive pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition that can lead to rapid death and current therapy is
only modestly effective. Tyrosine kinase inhibition with Nindedanib has proven to be a successful therapeutic
strategy for a number of pulmonary fibrosis disorders. However, due to the nonspecificity of Nintedanib it is
unclear which tyrosine kinases are most critical for driving fibrosis. Future mechanistic studies should focus on
identifying specific tyrosine kinases and cell types involved in fibrosis which may enable more precise targeting
of critical pro-fibrotic pathways. We have identified discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) as an attractive
therapeutic target. DDR2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor activated by fibrillar collagens such as type I collagen
and we have recently shown that type I collagen signaling promotes further fibroblast activation leading to a
feed forward/postive feedback loop culminating in progressive fibrosis. Furthermore, unlike DDR1, which is
highly expressed by many cell types, DDR2 expression is heavily skewed with much higher expression on
fibroblasts than other cell types. This is critical because we have recently reported that activation of ubiquitous
intracellular signaling pathways can have opposing effects on fibrosis depending on the cell type with pro-
fibrotic activation within fibroblasts but anti-fibrotic effects within epithelial cells. Thus, DDR2 may enable more
specific targeting of fibroblasts which are the primary fibrogenic effector cells. Recently a novel DDR2-specific
inhibitor has been shown to improve outcome in a model of lung cancer through inhibition of cancer associated
fibroblasts and DDR2-expressing cancer cells which have undergone mesenchymal transition. In preliminary
data we find that this inhibitor is also effective at inhibiting fibrosis. Our preliminary data also support a novel
mechanism by which DDR2 signaling regulates PIK3C2α, a poorly understood member of the PI3 kinase
family which has recently been shown to regulate TGFβ receptor internalization necessary for TGFβ signaling.
PIK3Cα has also been shown to regulate PDK1/Akt signaling consistent with our report that DDR2 regulates
fibroblast survival through PDK1/Akt. Finally, a recent report found that targeting fibroblast specific markers
using a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell approach was effective at attenuating cardiac fibrosis.
Collectively, this support our central hypothesis that DDR2 promotes fibrosis through fibroblast specific effects
on PIK3C2α/TGFβ signaling, resistance to apoptosis via PIK3C2α/PDK/Akt signaling and that DDR2
represents an attractive target for anti-fibrotic therapy. In addition to testing the importance of DDR2 with a
small molecule inhibitor, given skewed high fibroblast expression of DDR2, we will develop CAR-NK cells
targeting DDR2 for immunotherapy of pulmonary fibrosis. Unlike T cells, NK cells are not MHC restricted, do
not undergo clonal expansion and may therefore serve as off-the shelf therapeutic solution with minimum
toxicity. These studies will advance our understanding of a critical pro-fibrotic signaling pathway as well as
advance and refine the potential for adapting CAR immunotherapy for fibrosis."

 This is an application for a Career Development Award for Dr. Eva Raphael, a clinical research fellow and
future Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Her career goal is to be a family
medicine-trained clinician-researcher improving prevention and outcomes for community-onset antimicrobial
resistant infections by combining epidemiological methods to identify novel risk factors that can be intervened
upon. This award will provide her with the training and research experience to: (1) examine demographic and
neighborhood-level risk factors for community-onset urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by ESBL-producing
Escherichia coli (ESBL-UTI) among women; (2) identify complications for community-onset ESBL-UTI and
associated risk factors; and (3) investigate whether the temporal and geographic trends in prevalence of
community-onset ESBL-UTI correlate with trends in prevalence of predominant E. coli genotypes. To facilitate
successful completion of these activities, Dr. Raphael has assembled an ideal mentoring team comprised of
two co-primary mentors, Dr. Maria Glymour, an expert in social epidemiology methods and health inequities
research, and Dr. Henry Chambers, an expert in clinical antimicrobial resistance research, and a co-mentor,
Dr. Alison Huang, an expert in genitourinary health in older women and patient-reported outcomes. In addition,
Dr. Raphael will have 2 advisors: Dr. Salma Shariff-Marco, an expert in spatial epidemiology and neighborhood
effect on health outcomes, and Dr. Sara Tartof, an infectious disease epidemiologist who focuses on
antimicrobial resistance.
 The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant infections is increasing worldwide, both in healthcare and
community settings. While antibiotic use is a major driver for selection of antimicrobial resistant organisms,
novel risk factors are beginning to be identified for transmission of such organisms, especially in diverse
populations. Moreover, new evidence suggests antimicrobial resistant infections, particularly UTI, may occur as
community outbreaks. Therefore, it is essential to further examine risk factors other than antibiotic use for UTI
caused by antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, in particular ESBL-UTI, and whether they occur as outbreaks in
diverse communities. Dr. Raphael will build on findings from prior work showing that prevalence of community-
onset ESBL-UTI has increased in a San Francisco public safety-net healthcare system and differed by
race/ethnicity and age. Dr. Raphael will employ causal inference methods to identify novel individual and
neighborhood risk factors for ESBL-UTI compared to both non-ESBL antimicrobial resistant and susceptible
UTI and their complications (Aims 1 and 2). Through spatial analyses, geographic clusters of predominant E.
coli genotypes causing UTI, particularly ESBL-UTI, will be identified and compared to geographic distribution of
ESBL-UTI phenotypes (Aim 3). This work will be the basis of an R01 proposal for a longitudinal study
identifying multilevel risk factors and incidence of UTI recurrence and complications in a cohort of community-
dwelling women diagnosed with UTI.
 Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will gain skills in: (1) social
epidemiology methods; (2) spatial epidemiology; and (3) patient-reported outcomes research methods as they
apply to community-onset infections. These skills will facilitate Dr. Raphael's transition to independence by
uniquely positioning her to address multilevel factors to improve community-onset infections outcomes in
diverse populations."
10744388,"Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) is a maladaptive pathological process that is poorly understood and a condition
for which no effective therapies exist. It is largely recognized that neuroinflammation significantly contributes to
the development of chronic pain, however the mechanisms are not well understood. A unifying mechanism
through which pathological inflammation contributes to the development of chronic pain is by being a key
mediator of neuropathology and maladaptive plasticity in brain regions critical for processing somatosensory
information such as the somatosensory cortex (S1). The overarching hypothesis to be tested in this competitive
renewal is that strategies designed to mitigate pathological neuroinflammation will be therapeutic for spinal cord
injury (SCI)-Pain by promoting neurorepair and reducing maladaptive supraspinal plasticity. The studies
proposed in this application are based upon extensive published and preliminary data demonstrating diverging
roles for TNFR (TNFR1 and TNFR2) signaling and sex differences in the development and resolution of CNP in
SCI and peripheral nerve injury (CCI) models. The overarching goals of our competitive renewal are to better
understand mechanisms of CNP and to develop therapies that are effective in both women and men.
 The lack of understanding of neuron-immune cell interactions that lead to the development or resolution
of chronic pain is the overarching scientific premise to this application. Our scientific premise and hypotheses
will be tested in the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim1: Interrogate the mechanisms through which TNFR2 signaling mitigates neuroinflammation in
CNP in males and females.
Specific Aim 2: Interrogate the divergent roles for TNFR signaling in the development and resolution of CNP
and maladaptive plasticity in males and females.
Specific Aim 3: Interrogate the intersection between TNFR1 and ERβ in females and mechanisms whereby
inhibiting ERβ in females renders them “male-like” with respect to therapies for CNP."

 Alternative splicing (AS) of transcripts is an essential post-transcriptional process that is instrumental
for numerous cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The process of AS is regulated
by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and their proper nuclear localization and interactions with spliceosome
components which form visibly dense compartments called nuclear specks (NS). The ability for cancer to
hijack and utilize AS by targeting genes involved in EMT, invasion, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional
control has been described to influence metastatic potential and therapeutic resistance. More recently, it has
been shown that 50% of breast cancers contain overexpression or amplification of at least one RBP which
consequently targets gene transcripts for AS to induce invasive characteristics. Furthermore, a novel function
of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) recently revealed non-canonical RNA binding of ERα to influence post-
transcriptional regulation and promote cell fitness in response to environmental stressors. Our laboratory,
along with other, recently established a critical link between NF1 and ERα in regulation of ERα signaling. NF1
is a tumor suppressor gene, encoding for the protein neurofibromin, that when mutated drives of a subset of
breast cancers with poor prognosis. These studies have sparked motivation to investigate mechanisms in
which NF1-deficient breast cancers contribute to metastasis and endocrine resistance.
 The interaction between neurofibromin and ERα describes neurofibromins ability to act as a co-
repressor of ERα’s transcriptional activity. However, it still remains unknown whether this neurofibromin-ERα
interaction regulates ERα’s post-transcriptional regulation or the importance of neurofibromin localization for
this regulation. The overall goal of my F99 training phase (Aim 1) is to determine the role neurofibromin plays
in ERα post-transcriptional regulation. Specifically, the Aims are 1.1) to define neurofibromin’s impact on ERα
dependent post-transcriptional regulation in NF1 mutant ER+ breast cancer models and 1.2) determine the
efficacy of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) to impact ERα post-transcriptional regulation in
NF1-deficient cells. The training objectives in the F99 phase will expand my molecular techniques, sequencing,
and data analysis in cancer biology. During my K00 phase (Aim 2) I will define the impact nuclear
neurofibromin has on post-transcriptional regulation through nuclear speck formation and function. NF1-
deficient breast cancer models will be used to determine nuclear speck formation, composition, and post-
transcriptional and gene regulation. The training and data resulting from this fellowship award will establish the
foundation of scientific and professional skills for my career as an independent researcher."
10757690,"Project Abstract/Summary
The viral load can be controlled in the periphery of HIV-1-infected patients through consistent use of antiretroviral
therapy (ART). Despite this, over 50% of HIV-infected patients are predicted to suffer from HIV-associated
neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Although the pathogenesis of NCI is incompletely understood, HIV-1
transactivator of transcription (Tat) has been shown to be capable of being secreted from infected cells, and
once extracellular within the central nervous system (CNS) it will induce neuronal dysregulation. Early in the
infection, HIV-1 has been shown to establish a reservoir in the brain, either by entering as infected perivascular
macrophages or infecting resident microglia, prior to the patient receiving ART. ART does not affect the
production of Tat, which is continually made in these cells, leading to quantifiable levels of Tat in the absence of
detectable viral load. Tat sequence composition varies within and between individuals due to HIV-1’s error-prone
reverse transcriptase and host factors such as APOBEC3G. In the previous 5 years, we have shown that this
variation is associated with NCI, as shown by our studies comparing the HIV-1 Tat protein sequence composition
from impaired and non-impaired patients within the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study
(CARES) Cohort. Residues associated with NCI included 59P, 74H, and 12K, while 36V, 40T, 63E, and 23T
were associated with non-impairment. Effects of Tat variation can be further exemplified by Tat’s interaction with
the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). This interaction can be weakened when Tat undergoes a C31S mutation, as
shown in HIV-1 subtype C infections. Our preliminary data has shown that Tat genetic variants within the CARES
Cohort have different predicted interaction profiles with GRIN2A, a subunit of NMDAR. Although the Tat-NMDAR
interaction has been shown to be an established driver of HAND, it may not be the only factor involved in NCI in
neuroHIV. Given this, we hypothesize that HIV-1 Tat genetic variation may cause differential secretion of Tat
and/or affect Tat’s binding to molecular targets leading to neuronal dysfunction that underlies NCI in neuroHIV.
To investigate this, we propose three Aims. Aim 1 will determine if amino acid variations in Tat associated with
NCI via peripheral blood sampling correlates to that found in the CNS and/or intact provirus. Aim 2 will explore
the impact of HIV-1 Tat genetic variation on protein-protein interactions that contribute to HAND pathogenesis.
Aim 3 will assess the contribution of HIV-1 Tat variants to NCI using an in vivo model of Tat-induced
neuropathogenesis. Overall, these studies will contribute to defining the mechanism of how HIV-1 Tat
polymorphisms alter interactions with neurons and ultimately affect CNS function. Successful completion of the
proposed project will result in a better understanding of the etiology of HAND, potential development of diagnostic
assay for HAND, and identification of novel Tat-mediated targets for treating NCI."

 The proto-oncogene KRAS is one of the most critical genes in cancer, yet, as a drug target, it has proven
to be among the most elusive. A remarkable 30% of lung adenocarcinomas, 45% of colon, and 98% of pancreatic
cancers are driven by KRAS mutations. These cancers account for the top 3 causes of cancer-related
deaths in the United States. Most cancer associated KRAS mutations result in a constitutively active protein,
which drives aberrantly high downstream signaling of pro-proliferative and pro-survival effectors including the
MAPK and PI3K pathways. Kinase inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of many cancers driven by other
molecular aberrations, yet, unfortunately a lack of such success in KRAS-driven cancers has led to KRAS
itself to be widely regarded as “undruggable”. EnFuego Therapeutics, Inc. (EFTX) was founded to address
the growing number of “undruggable” targets in cancer using RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics. RNAi
is particularly attractive for KRAS targeting because it can be optimized to enable selective silencing of mutant
transcripts while sparing wild type transcripts, which is important for maintaining normal function in nonmalignant
tissue. Mutation-specific therapeutics against KRAS are under development by several companies such as
Amgen and Mirati, and rely on small molecules (specific only to G12C mutations). Unlike prior RNAi strategies
in cancer, the EFTX approach employs nucleotide modification and ligand conjugation chemistries to promote
in vivo stability and affinity-based targeting in cancer cells. In particular, ligand conjugation represents a
significant advantage over legacy delivery technologies such as lipid nanoparticles. We have shown that
EnFuego siRNAs targeting mutant KRAS transcripts result in: 1) reduced oncogenic MAPK signaling, 2) reduced
cancer cell proliferation, and 3) reduced tumor burden in murine cancer models. Based on these preliminary
data, this Fast Track program will further develop EFTX siRNA technologies for targeting mutant KRAS in
humans. During Phase I, we will focus on optimization of fully chemically modified (FM) siRNA compounds that
potently and specifically silence mutant G12V transcripts, exhibit serum stability and immune stealth, and inhibit
downstream cancer cell signaling. Two to three FM siRNAs will be selected as lead compound candidates for
progression to Phase II studies. Phase II Specific Aims will focus on optimization of pharmacokinetics, tissue
targeting, and efficacy in murine models of metastatic lung cancer. These data will inform the selection of a single
candidate for scale up and a 4-week GLP safety assessment study. As such, this Fast Track program will
accelerate progression of this novel therapeutic strategy toward filing an Investigational New Drug application
for metastatic lung cancer therapy."
10760246,"Project Summary
Uveitis is a difficult-to-treat inflammatory eye disorder. Treatment options for uveitis are limited by an
incomplete understanding of molecular causes of the disease. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery
that Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV), an inherited uveitis, is caused
by mutations to the gene CAPN5. The CAPN5 gene produces the Calpain-5 (CAPN5) protease, which cleaves
off regions of other proteins to regulate their functions. Our data show that CAPN5 becomes hyperactive in
ADNIV. We identified Iroquois-3 (IRX3) as a new cleavage target of CAPN5 in the retina. IRX3 is a potent
transcription factor implicated in inflammatory disease states. Identification of CAPN5 uveitis and a new
CAPN5 target make possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach to identifying factors responsible
for uveitis. The long-term goal of our research is to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of uveitis.
This proposal’s objective is to determine the role of IRX3 cleavage in ADNIV. Our central hypothesis is that
hyperactive ADNIV CAPN5 hyper-cleaves regulatory domains from IRX3, over-activating IRX3 transcriptional
activity at inflammatory genes and driving destructive inflammation in ADNIV. Our rationale is that by studying
the newly-identified CAPN5-IRX3 pathway, we will identify new disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.
Our data indicate that CAPN5 cleaves IRX3 toward its C-terminus. Additionally, we generated peptide
substrates and a potential inhibitor compound for CAPN5 based on IRX3. Our data also show that IRX3
regulates a subset of ADNIV inflammatory genes in vitro. When comparing wild-type IRX3 to CAPN5-cleaved
(“cut”) IRX3, our assays found that cut-IRX3 shows greater nuclear localization and increased binding to the IL-
6 promoter (a key ADNIV inflammatory gene). Our specific aims are to use biochemical, molecular, and
physiologic studies in cells and animals to test the hypotheses that: (1) CAPN5 targets a specific domain on
IRX3 for cleavage and physical interaction which can be isolated and developed into peptide substrates; (2)
CAPN5 cleavage of IRX3 increases IRX3 nuclear localization and activity, contributing to uveitis in mice; and
(3) Irx3-null mice will show resistance to developing ADNIV and intraocular inflammation phenotypes.
We expect this work to have a significant positive impact on identifying new molecular mechanisms for
therapeutic intervention in uveitis. At the completion of this project, we expect to have: (1) Isolated the IRX3
cleavage site and developed peptide substrates and potential inhibitor compounds; (2) Determined the
consequences of CAPN5 cleavage on IRX3, identifying new molecular pathways which might be targeted
therapeutically; and (3) Determined the significance of the Irx3 pathway in intraocular inflammation. As ADNIV
mimics other eye diseases, our work promises to have a broad impact beyond ADNIV and uveitis."
10760247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a global human health problem. Our long-term goal is
to understand molecular mechanisms of NAFLD, and to translate this knowledge into novel therapeutic strategies.
Due to the physiologic similarities between humans and mice, and the propensity of mice to develop a disease
closely mimicking NAFLD when fed a high fat diet (HFD), mice have provided us with fundamental insights into
NAFLD pathogenesis. In humans and mice, genetic variation influences the rate and severity of hepatosteatosis
under a given set of environmental conditions. To identify genes that influence the process, we utilized unbiased
forward genetic screening and highly automated meiotic mapping to identify mutations that cause NAFLD in mice
sensitized by a HFD. Two semi-dominant missense alleles of predicted gene 4951 (Gm4951), named Oily and
Carboniferous, were detected in this screen. As distinct from most NAFLD mutants that are associated with
obesity, our preliminary data showed that Gm4951 deficient mice had dramatically increased hepatic lipid
accumulation without a concomitant increase of body weight on a HFD. Gm4951 was highly expressed in
hepatocytes. Knockout of Gm4951 increased lipid content and overexpression of Gm4951 decreased lipid
content of primary hepatocytes in vitro, suggesting hepatocyte-intrinsic regulation of lipid content. Gm4951
knockout livers showed decreased expression of lipid oxidation genes. Mass spectrometry analysis of
endogenous GM4951 interacting proteins revealed interaction with lipid droplet protein Hydroxysteroid 17β-
dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) and lipid oxidation enzymes. Moreover, the transcription of Gm4951 in
hepatocytes was activated by interferon gamma (IFN-γ), which effectively decreased lipid content, much as when
GM4951 was overexpressed. These results led to our central hypothesis that GM4951 is critical for promoting
lipid oxidation, and limits hepatic lipid accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we propose to pursue three Specific
Aims. Aim 1 will further investigate the development of NAFLD in GM4951 deficient mice. Aim 2 will determine
the precise mechanistic role of GM4951 in regulating lipid metabolism. Aim 3 will study the transcriptional
regulation of Gm4951, including the liver-specific expression pattern and the inducible expression by IFN-γ.
Understanding how to activate GM4951 and what’s the human homolog of GM4951 would offer approaches to
preventing or treating NAFLD. These will be studied in Aim 3 as well. The NAFLD phenotype caused by GM4951
deficiency is fundamentally distinct from the classic obesity-associated NAFLD mouse models. GM4951 is
specifically expressed in the liver and operates there to limit lipid accumulation. Thus, finding ways to activate
GM4951 will provide a new means of reducing hepatic lipid content. Completion of the proposed work will
suggest new therapeutic targets to combat NAFLD."
10761786,"Project 1 Summary: The overall goal of Project 1 is to induce tolerance of porcine kidneys in
baboons by co-transplantation (Tx) of vascularized donor thymus. We have made significant progress
during the current project period (2016-2020). First, we have identified the mechanism responsible for
proteinuria, a significant obstacle in our GalT-KO pig-to-baboon kidney xenotransplant (XTx) model for
the long-term survival of life-supporting kidney xenografts, and developed effective treatment strategies
for overcoming it. Down-regulation of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b and up-regulation
of CD80 on pig podocytes were found to play critical roles in proteinuria and species incompatibility
between pig CD47 and baboon SIRPα, which caused phagocytosis of pig endothelial cells and
podocytes by baboon macrophages, was observed. We learned that either the administration of
CTLA4-Ig and rituximab mAb for GalT-KO grafts or the use hCD47 transgenic (Tg) GalT-KO kidney
grafts inhibited the development of post-transplant proteinuria, and markedly prolonged baboon survival
up to 193 days. While the exponential growth of pig grafts or drug-related side effects triggered the
euthanasia of recipient baboons, no evidence of graft rejection was seen and both pig-specific
unresponsiveness in vitro, and the development of new baboon T cells were observed in multiple
recipients VT+K XTx. Second, in collaboration with Project 2, we have achieved prolonged peripheral
blood macrochimerism lasting >60 days accompanied by gradual loss of anti-non-Gal antibodies (abs)
in baboons following hCD47+ pig intra-bone bone marrow Tx. Such durable porcine chimerism has not
been previously achieved in any primate. Our renewal is focused on achieving two aims. Aim 1:
Optimize the protocol for pig kidney XTx with vascularized thymic grafts by determining: (1)
acceptable non-Gal ab levels; (2) requirement for human complement regulatory protein Tg for recipients
with high non-Gal ab levels; (3) a strategy to prevent rejection in recipients with high non-Gal abs; (4)
acceptable preservation times of pig kidney and thymus grafts using an FDA-approved continuous
organ preservation machine; and (5) the ability to completely terminate immunosuppression. Aim 2:
Determine the ability of combined VT+KTx and IBBMTx using hCD47+ human IL3 receptor (hIL3r)
transgenic (Tg) pigs as BM donors on (achieve robust, durable T cell tolerance by combined
deletional and regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, we will also explore the ability of this
combined approach to permit long-term kidney xenograft tolerance in baboons with high non-Gal
natural antibody levels. We anticipate that the above studies will lead to achievement of the short-
term goal of extending pig VTL+KTx grafts to clinical applications in the next five years, and the long-
term goal of inducing robust tolerance of pig xenografts, respectively."
10761788,"Project 2 Summary
Project 2 is directed toward the induction of xenotransplantation tolerance through mixed hematopoietic chimerism,
which is the only treatment regimen to date that has been successful in translating allogeneic tolerance induction
from animal models to the clinic. In previous funding periods, we have overcome two of the major barriers to
establishment of pig-to-primate mixed chimerism through: 1) development of α1,3-galactosyltransferase null (GalT-
KO) miniature swine, which avoid the problem of hyperacute rejection due to natural anti-Gal antibodies; 2) addition
of the hCD47 transgene to these GalT-KO swine, thereby avoiding removal of bone marrow stem cells due to
phagocytosis by macrophages bearing the species-specific SIRP-alpha receptor; and 3) development of a
methodology for intra-bone administration of porcine HSC (IBBM), which increased the ability of GalT-KO/CD47
inocula to engraft. These efforts have led to markedly increased levels and duration of porcine chimerism in
baboons, as well as to prolonged survival of donor swine skin xenografts, in the absence of immunosuppression.
In addition, we have demonstrated that mixed chimerism can lower the levels of natural anti-pig non-Gal antibodies
and that this effect is proportional to the duration of chimerism. Since renal xenograft survival remains markedly
affected by the levels of recipient anti-pig nAbs and since humans, like baboons, show marked variability in levels
of such nAbs, ways of improving the levels and prolonging the duration of mixed chimerism will be required in order
to make xenografts available to all potential human recipients. Our Specific Aims are now directed toward optimizing
the effect of mixed chimerism on elimination of nAbs and inducing tolerance by: 1) Testing our new human cytokine
receptor transgenic GalT-KO miniature swine as HSC donors; 2) Utilizing recipient Tregs to enhance xenogeneic
chimerism; and 3) Applying our optimized mixed chimerism approach to induction of renal xenograft tolerance."
10761789,"The level of immunosuppression needed to maintain long-term xenograft survival in humans is expected to be
high, resulting in toxicity, and may not fully prevent rejection. Induction of xenograft tolerance would overcome
this limitation. We have developed two approaches to inducing human immune tolerance to the pig, namely
mixed xenogeneic chimerism and porcine thymic transplantation, in a human immune system (HIS) mouse
model. Each approach centrally tolerizes human T cells to the donor pig. Additionally, mixed xenogeneic
chimerism tolerizes human NK cells and B cells producing anti-pig xenoantibodies, providing the basis for large
animal studies in Projects 1 and 2. However, human T cells developing in porcine thymus grafts, while tolerant
of the donor pig, demonstrate some homeostatic defects, lack tolerance to human tissue-restricted antigens
(TRAs) and show reduced responses to antigens presented by HLA compared to T cells developing in a human
thymus. In the project period, we have made progress in constructing a “hybrid” porcine thymus that contains
human thymic epithelial cells (hTECs) derived from post-natal human thymus or human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) and demonstrated beneficial immunological effects of adding hTECs to the porcine thymus graft. In
the renewal, we propose to build on these results to further improve the development of human immune systems
tolerant to the pig, provoking further advances in the large animal models and ultimately in patients. In Aim 1,
we will achieve optimal tolerance and immune function by combining mixed chimerism with either hybrid thymic
transplantation or pig plus human thymic transplantation, modeling pig thymic transplantation without human
recipient thymectomy. We will compare T cell reconstitution and tolerance to the pig and the human, including
assessment of Treg mechanisms. We will utilize novel TCR transgenic tools to determine the impact of each
method on thymic selection. We hypothesize that the ideal combination of thymus transplantation and mixed
chimerism will generate a highly diverse, permanently and robustly tolerant TCR repertoire that recognizes both
donor HLA- and SLA-restricted antigens. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms of T and B cell tolerance
via mixed chimerism and thymic transplantation. For T cell tolerance, we will generate and make use of directly
and indirectly xenoreactive human anti-pig TCRs and human anti-pig Treg TCRs generated from human anti-pig
responses. The impact of mixed chimerism and thymic transplantation on selection of these human anti-pig
TCRs will be determined. We will also assess B cell tolerance to known porcine carbohydrate targets of human
Nab-producing cells and use fluorochrome-labelled carbohydrate-protein conjugates, analysis of supernatants
of stimulated B cells, and ELISPOT assays to determine the mechanisms of human B cell tolerance. Collectively,
these studies will provide important proofs of principle and mechanistic insights into the human T and B cell
tolerance achieved with mixed chimerism and xenogeneic thymic transplantation and will advance the
approaches being tested in large animals in Projects 1 and 2 of this PPG, ultimately for application in humans."

10765730,"Project Summary/Abstract
Multidrug-resistant bacteria are an increasing health threat. Most new antibacterial agents are natural products
that are made by bacteria, or their synthetic derivatives. This is because, over evolutionary time, bacteria gain
the ability to synthesize small molecules that very selectively target essential processes in other bacteria. One
problem in identifying good antibacterial agents that are relatively nontoxic to people is that early drug
discovery assays cannot determine whether compounds are truly selective until well into the drug development
process. There is no reason that randomly cultivated bacteria from the environment would produce chemicals
that are benign in humans, yet lethal to competing bacteria. Finding those compounds, or improving existing
compounds to minimize toxicity and improve antibacterial activity, requires a significant investment. Here, we
propose to examine symbiotic bacteria that are compatible with animal physiology, and for which evolution
favors the production of selective antibacterial agents. The bacteria are enriched within animal hosts, where
they produce hundreds or perhaps thousands of small molecule natural products. One of the main ecological
roles of the symbiotic bacteria is likely to clear other bacteria from the host. Proof-of-concept experiments
demonstrate that the bacteria produce nontoxic compounds that very selectively target human pathogens,
including some of the most lethal bacterial pathogens that infect humans. In this program, we will optimize
identified, chemically novel antibacterial compounds by understanding their mechanisms of action and by
investigating and improving their existing properties further through chemical synthesis. Further, we will
continue to identify and characterize promising new antibacterial agents that are previously unknown to
science. Our long-term goal is to provide a novel pipeline of new antibacterial agents to combat multidrug
resistance."
10765496,"ABSTRACT
A fundamental question in biology that has yet to be answered is how an organism's environment regulates its
growth and development. Unlike animals, plants neither have specific organs that see or hear various
environmental stimuli nor can they move around to avoid adverse conditions. Although lacking a brain, plants
can successfully integrate internal and external cues and make appropriate decisions about growth. In contrast
to animals, growth in plants occurs post-embryonically, to produce new organs and for the growth and
modification of existing forms to adapt to the local environment. Light is among the most relevant environmental
signals because it not only drives photosynthesis but also provides critical information about the local growth
environment as well as diurnal and seasonal timing. Over the next few years, my laboratory will aim to understand
the molecular mechanisms by which a plant perceives and responds to its light environment. To address our
questions, we will use cryptochromes (CRYs), the UV-A/blue light photoreceptors, as they form the interface
between the light environment and the organism. CRYs are present in diverse organisms, including humans,
where they regulate circadian rhythms and several physiological processes, like metabolism, growth, and
magnetoreception. We will obtain mechanistic insights on how CRY regulates gene expression at the cellular
level, which leads to morphological changes at the organismal level. We will also determine how light and the
newly identified CRY2-associated molecules that we have discovered function in CRY-mediated signaling
pathways. Also, our research will unravel the novel mechanisms by which CRYs, through their interaction with
the RNA-binding proteins that we have discovered, control RNA metabolism, specifically that of methylated
RNAs (m6A). m6A is an RNA modification that controls its fate as a reversible regulatory mark, and disruption of
RNA methylation leads to growth defects in plants and is linked to several human diseases. We will also address
how CRYs integrate environmental signals and modify chromatin through their interaction with chromatin
remodelers, whose findings will fill a large void in this field. The success of this study will significantly improve
crop productivity to feed the growing human population and aid in the development of optogenetic tools to target
neuronal disorders. In humans, disruption of CRY activity is associated with many human disorders, including
cancer, inflammation, insomnia, and diabetes. Understanding CRY function can lead to both prevention and
treatment of these diseases. Taken together, our research will have a broad impact on agriculture and human
health and disease."

Carbohydrates form the basis of all living organisms and are ubiquitous both in nature and in medicine.
However, methods for the chemical synthesis of carbohydrates remain cumbersome. The rapid growth of R&D
in glycoscience demands the development of rapid, efficient, and simple procedures for glycan synthesis. This
proposal seeks to meet this demand by focusing on the development of an affordable and accessible
automation platform that will enable both specialists and non-specialists to perform the synthesis of glycans
from renewable precursors. Current methods for the synthesis of glycans are highly sophisticated and
operationally complex. By contrast, high performance liquid chromatography equipment-based automation
(HPLC-A) represents a highly accessible method for synthesis because many scientists already have easy
access to HPLC equipment. Automated synthesis offers operational simplicity by delivering all reagents using
standard HPLC components, but also convenient real-time reaction monitoring of every step. Some of our
automated reactions have been accurately reproduced by a minimally trained high-school student researcher.
Unexpected recent pandemic revealed unpreparedness of our society, but also gave us an opportunity to
showcase how HPLC-A can be utilized to enhance our productivity. This proposal aims to improve our HPLC-A
setup by introducing a universal platform for completely automated synthesis of glycans from simple and
renewable precursors. We propose to develop a dedicated automated circuit for the synthesis of sugar building
blocks and will develop dedicated glycosylation methods that will connect monosaccharides into oligomeric
networks in the automated setting modes for syntheses on solid supports and in solution. We will accessorize
our system with new modules and attachments to achieve high efficiency of synthetic steps, improve
reproducibility of reactions, help to reduce reagent and solvent excess. We will then demonstrate how well
these strategic adjustments work in the completely automated, “press of a button” production of glycans. We
are currently interested in glycans found in human milk, but the developed methods and technologies will also
allow to achieve other sequences.
Upon completion of the proposed studies, we expect to have achieved a reliable and simple platform for
completely automated synthesis of glycans from simple and renewable precursors. Investigators with access to
standard HPLC equipment should be able to perform automated synthesis using our methods. Machine-
assisted synthesis ensures rigorous experimental design to obtain robust results, to eliminate variability, and to
accurately reproduce experiments multiple times by different users. Synthesis of glycans using this user-
friendly, automated platform will accelerate discovery in many scientific disciplines and can significantly impact
technology, society, the economy, and public health."

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death, with over 47,000 preventable deaths per year in the U.S. alone. The
rate of suicide death across the U.S. has risen by 33% over the past two decades. In spite of this dramatic
public health crisis, suicide research lags far behind other major health conditions due to the perception that
risk factors are too complex and uncontrollable for study. Importantly, while environment has undeniable
impact, evidence suggests that genetic factors play a major role in suicide death. While the study of genetic
risks is therefore promising, most studies of suicide genetics have focused on the much more common traits of
suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This strategy has allowed other research groups to acquire sufficiently
statistically-powered samples. However, suicidal behaviors can be difficult to quantify, and represent
individuals with a wide range of risk for later suicide death. Using the unique resources available to the Utah
Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are able to study the genetic risks of the unambiguous, high-impact
health outcome of suicide death directly. The USGRS currently has DNA from >6,000 population-ascertained
suicide deaths; this resource grows by ~650 cases per year through an unprecedented two-decade
collaboration with the Utah Department of Health’s centralized Office of the Medical Examiner (OME). We have
completed whole genome sequence (WGS) data on a subset of 281 of the Utah suicide deaths selected for
high genetic risk. We have Illumina PsychArray data on these cases and additional Utah suicides (total
N=4,382). All cases are linked to the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a statewide resource that includes
demographic data and comprehensive medical records. The UPDB phenotypic data also includes unique
information on familial risk far exceeding that of other data resources through genealogical records that go
back to the 1700s. To truly understand risk of suicide death and to implement highly effective interventions
that provide appropriate, targeted services to those most likely to die, we must understand the risks specifically
associated with suicide deaths. This proposal focuses on the identification, validation, characterization, and
replication of variants with high functional impact that implicate genes and gene pathways important for risk of
suicide death. From our WGS data, we have already detected high-impact structural variants (SVs) and single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) showing genome-wide significant gene pathway enrichment and protein-protein
interactions. These pathways are also supported by genes implicated in our genome-wide association
analyses of 3,413 Utah suicide deaths, suggesting overlap at the functional level of rare and common risk
variation. Extensive familial risk data and large sample size will allow us to select an additional subset of 760
suicides with enhanced genetic risk to replicate and extend our current findings, setting the stage for
identification of high-risk individuals, and for development of targeted interventions."
10767112,"Many Veterans experience occupational exposure to low-level blast (LLB) during normal training operations,
including but not limited to breaching activity. These Veterans are at increased risk for persisting
neuropsychological impairment due to repeated LLB exposure over several deployments with limited time for
recovery between exposures. The extent of the long-term consequences after cumulative LLB exposure is
unknown, though reports show that deficits can be present late in life. Furthermore, the resultant post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD)-related behavioral deficits are more pronounced in soldiers and Veterans with a history
of chronic blast exposure. There is no clear understanding of which pathological mechanisms drive this chronic
PTSD phenotype after LLB exposure. A few animal models have been established to address this incomplete
understanding of the pathobiological mechanisms underlying LLB exposure. These models replicate the
chronic depressive, anxiogenic, and PTSD-related traits observed in Veterans, though there are many
knowledge gaps in what contributes to these chronic deficits. In general, blast exposure causes acute blood-
brain barrier (BBB) and neurovascular unit abnormalities that can persist over time. The overall objective of this
application is to determine the timing of acute neurovascular dysfunction after LLB and how repeating LLB
contributes to chronic neurovascular impairment and neuropsychological deficits. Our central hypothesis is that
LLB repeated at a time interval of maximal BBB impairment, after the first LLB, will result in persistent PTSD-
like behavioral traits. Additionally, these deficits will be associated with changes in the profile of serum-derived
exosomal miRNAs and platelet bioenergetics. These hypotheses were formulated based on current literature
and our own published and preliminary data demonstrating anxiety and amygdalar BBB disruption after blast
exposure. By utilizing a multimodal blast simulator at the University of Kentucky, these studies will be able to
examine the longitudinal behavioral profile, coupled with pathologically relevant biomarkers. These hypotheses
will be tested in three specific aims: 1) examine acute neurovascular deficits after a single LLB exposure and
determine their relationship to longitudinal behavioral traits, 2) determine how repeating LLB at various time
intervals, based on the acute neurovascular profile, contributes to exacerbated or prolonged PTSD-like
behavioral traits and chronic neurovascular impairment, 3) identify if modulating either acute or chronic
neurovascular health using sildenafil will mitigate long-term PTSD-like behavioral traits. This research will
drastically improve our understanding of the effects of LLB as well as potentially identify novel, clinically-
relevant biomarkers. The proposed research is significant because it will establish a platform to understand the
chronic effects of occupational blast exposure, which affects many Veterans. In addition, this line of
investigation can lead to better therapeutic targeting of neurovascular dysfunction to improve neurological
outcome in aging Veterans. In addition to the research products gained by this proposal, the applicant will
greatly benefit from a mentoring team that has a variety of preclinical, translational, and clinical perspectives,
which will contribute to a well-rounded career development plan. The training program will add additional
techniques to Dr. Hubbard’s’ repertoire, contributing not only to this proposal but to his VA research program
moving forward. With prior knowledge in blast injury modeling, additional behavioral and biomarker assays will
greatly advance his research expertise. In the latter years of this proposal, Dr. Hubbard will continue to expand
grant writing, student mentoring, collaborative research and presentation skills required of independent
researchers. Overall, the proposed studies and diverse mentoring program will culminate in producing a highly
successful independent VA researcher."

and exposed to high levels of particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5, particles small enough to deposit
in the small airways and alveoli) from frequent dust storms, burn-pit smoke (waste burning), and poorly
regulated industrial and vehicular sources. Previous studies have reported that deployed personnel have
experienced symptoms consistent with chronic respiratory disease. However, objective evidence of exposure-
related health effects is limited. To address this concern, VA Cooperative Study #595 “Service and Health
Among Deployed Veterans (SHADE)” is being conducted to examine the hypothesis that greater cumulative
exposure to PM2.5 while deployed is associated with lower lung function assessed by spirometry. A key
strength of SHADE is an exposure assessment approach that will use of historical satellite and regional
visibility records to reconstruct deployment-related PM2.5 in 5000 Veterans assessed at 6 centers.
A limitation of spirometry is that it is insensitive to early lung disease. This proposal is one of three
collaborative projects to systematically examine the pulmonary and systemic consequences of exposure during
deployment. We will conduct additional assessments in 280 SHADE participants (70 at each of four sites;
Boston, Minneapolis, Seattle, Houston) with and without respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze, dyspnea) as
assessed on the CSP #595 respiratory health questionnaire and with little smoking history (former smokers
with <10 pack years or never smokers). In the Boston proposal we will use CT imaging to test the hypothesis
that Veterans deployed to Southwest Asia and Afghanistan will have evidence of structural lung disease
associated with respiratory symptoms, a lower FEV1, and deployment-related PM2.5.
In addition to structural assessment by CT scan, as part of each collaborative proposal, participants will also
have (a) assessment of systemic biomarkers and immune cell activation (lead by Minneapolis and Houston
VA), and (b) additional physiologic characterization using diffusion capacity (gas exchange), exhaled nitric
oxide (eosinophilic airway inflammation), and IgE and eosinophilia (allergy) (lead by VA Puget Sound). We will
test the hypothesis that greater exposure to deployment-related PM2.5 results in specific airway and lung
parenchymal endotypes that could be distinguished by functional, structural, and biochemical mechanisms.
Our three coordinated proposals will complement CSP #595 by comprehensively characterizing early
deployment-related lung findings related to PM2.5 exposure that may in the future be used to assess disease.
The resultant exposure-related disease types identified provide new clinical applications for the recognition,
management, and future treatment strategies for Veterans with deployment-related lung disease."

abnormalities in gas exchange and in small airways function that could indicate early lung disease. We will
measure the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), a breath test that indirectly measures oxygen
transfer from air to blood, and is a marker of gas exchange abnormality and lung injury. We will also measure
two clinical tests that examine small airways function: (1) impulse oscillometry which uses forced oscillations to
measure small airways resistance (R5-R20), and (2) nitrogen multiple breath washout test to determine the
lung clearance index, a measure of ventilation heterogeneity. The MBW test also provides the functional
residual capacity, a measure of lung volumes not available with spirometry alone. We will examine whether
these clinical tests are associated with respiratory symptoms and air pollution during deployment (PM2.5).
In addition to the physiologic tests in this proposal, as part of the overall collaborative proposal, participants will
also have: (a) structural assessment of the lung by CT scan (project led by Dr. Garshick at the Boston VA) and
(b) assessment of systemic biomarkers and immune cell activation (project led by Dr. Wendt at the
Minneapolis VA, and Dr. Kheradmand at the Houston VA). Using the CT data from the Boston VA project, this
proposal will examine the relationship between DLCO, R5-R20, and LCI with CT structural abnormalities such
as emphysema and gas-trapping.
In the collaborative analysis, we will test the hypothesis that greater exposure to deployment-related PM2.5
results in specific airway and lung parenchymal endotypes that could be distinguished by functional, structural,
and biochemical mechanisms. Our three coordinated proposals will complement CSP #595 by
comprehensively characterizing early deployment-related lung findings related to PM2.5 exposure that may in
the future be used to assess disease. By identifying different exposure-related disease types, this research will
help in the recognition and treatment of Veterans with deployment-related lung disease."
11143461,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pain is a public health problem, a major driver of health care seeking and medication use, a major cause
of disability, and a key factor affecting quality of life and productivity. Music-based interventions (MBIs) including
music therapy (MT) are known to be effective for managing pain in several populations. However, substantial
gaps remain in understanding the mechanisms of action (e.g., cognitive, genomic, metabolomic, and neurologic)
by which MBIs influence pain. Barriers to advancing this mechanistic r esearch have included: 1) lack of
meaningful and inclusive collaboration between music therapists and mechanistic scientists; 2) inconsistent
application and definition of MBIs, patient-reported outcomes, and biological measures; and 3) lack of funding
and infrastructure to support interdisciplinary pilot projects.
 This proposal seeks to establish a NEW collaborative network: Effective Network to advance Scientific
Evidence related to Mechanisms of music-Based interventions for pain and support coLlaborative Efforts
(ENSEMBLE) to advance collaborative research efforts investigating the mechanisms by which MBIs influence
various pain phenotypes. ENSEMBLE will be built on a foundation of well-integrated medical MT practice, strong
mechanistic science in integrative health and medicine (IHM), research investigating MT and biological
mechanisms of pain in SCD and the BraveNet Practice-Based Research Network. At the outset, SCD will serve
as the pain-related condition of interest given the expertise of ENSEMBLE team members at present and strong
preliminary data, but other pain conditions will be addressed in future years.
 ENSEMBLE will be led by investigators from University Hospitals of Cleveland/Case Western Reserve
University, University of California Irvine, The Louis Armstrong Center for Music & Medicine, Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Emory University. ENSEMBLE will establish a vibrant collaborative network of
music therapists, mechanistic scientists, music intervention researchers, IHM resear chers, and patient-advocacy
organizations.
 The Specific Aims are to: (1) promote meaningful, inclusive, and interdisciplinary collaboration between
music therapists, mechanistic scientists, and IHM researchers; (2) develop a comprehensive framework for
conducting mechanistic studies in MBIs for pain management; and (3) advance multiple pilot projects
investigating novel biological mechanisms of action underlying the effects of MBIs for various pain phenotypes.
 The IMPACT of ENSEMBLE will be instrumental in 1) promoting meaningful interdisciplinary dialogue; 2)
building multi-institutional capacity for initiating MBI research in pain management; 3) generating preliminary
data for future R21 or R34 grant proposals; 4) improving data infrastructure; 5) developing future MT clinician
researchers; 6) focusing future scientific efforts; and 7) disseminating best practices."
10767331,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center (UK-SRC) will focus on a prevention and intervention
paradigm with an overarching goal to promote healthy lifestyles (i.e., healthful nutrition and increased physical
activity) to reduce disease risks associated with exposure to a subclass of persistent halogenated chemicals
(e.g. PCBs, TCE, and PFAS). Our biomedical research will be coupled with environmental science/engineering
research that uses novel sensing, remediation, and fate and transport science to prevent or reduce exposure
risks in the environment. Our biomedical research is integrated around a full life-span perspective and a
paradigm that uses animal studies to identify possible hypotheses that can be tested against existing human
databases to further identify potential intervention strategies. Our environmental science research is integrated
around a project cross-talk that uses fate and transport science to help inform technology development using
novel material science designed to reduce exposure to organic pollutants and that can then be deployed in
field applications. Both biomedical and environmental science projects are crosslinked around a common set of
pollutants and the use of animal models to test the toxicity of these pollutants and different remediation by-
products. To provide an optimal support environment and the requisite infrastructure to accomplish the
Center’s goal, we propose four specific aims for our Administrative Core (ADMC): 1) activities management
and integration, 2) bi-directional communication strategies, 3) partnerships and technology transfer, and 4)
evaluation and management processes. Management and integration functions are facilitated by monthly
Center meetings, and ADMC leadership and trainee interns are drawn from the individual research projects. Bi-
directional communication with other SRP centers and agency scientists and research translation to other
stakeholders are now fully integrated within the ADMC and overseen by a dedicated research translation
coordinator with support from a communications director. The ADMC effectively facilities investigator-initiated
research translation and technology transfer functions by leveraging a new integrated Data Management and
Analysis Core along with multidirectional internal (e.g. NIH funded UK Center for Clinical and Translational
Science (CCTS) WHY program, UK P30 pilot grants, Kentucky Water Institute) and external (e.g. EPA,
ADSTR, Kentucky Cabinet for Energy and the Environment (KYEEC), ARCADIS Consultants, individual water
utilities) partnerships. Evaluation and management processes are overseen by the ADMC director as assisted
by the program administer. The focus of the ADMC on the establishment and maintenance of a continuous
improvement development processes, along with internal and external relationships, positions the UK-SRC to
contribute not only important scientific findings but also to the collaborative processes and innovative
endeavors associated with the national Superfund Research Program."
10767332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This core provides analytical services to UK-SRC investigators who are engaged in studies of the sensing,
distribution and remediation of environmental toxicants and who are investigating their mechanisms of toxicity
approaches to mitigate these toxic effects. This research is important because exposure to these kinds of
environmental chemicals contributes to risk of non-communicable diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular
disease in humans. The core provides access to state-of-the-art gas and liquid chromatography coupled mass
spectrometer systems that are used for measurements of environmental chemicals, their metabolites and
degradation products and other biomolecules of interest including biomarkers of diet, nutrition and disease risk.
Core services encompass targeted and untargeted analytical methods using liquid chromatography and gas
chromatography coupled multistage/high resolution mass spectrometry. The core provides established/routine
services and can develop new services or adapt services from literature methods. The core is managed by the
Director who works with the Administrative Core to oversee the business operation, scheduling and
prioritization of services which are provided by experienced PhD level staff. A Laboratory Information
Management System is used for sample tracking, enforcement of standard operating procedures, quality
management and data reporting to project leaders and the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC).
Services are further validated by participation in external proficiency testing programs. The goals of the core
will be accomplished by addressing the following specific aims: 1. To provide analytical chemistry services
to UK SRC investigators. The core provides services to all the component projects. These include
measurements of chemical pollutants in environmental matrices including water and soil for studies of their
transport, distribution, sensing and remediation conducted by projects 1 and 2. Services provided to the
biomedical projects 1 and 2 include measurements of environmental pollutants in studies using in vitro systems
and preclinical models. Untargeted analytical methods using high resolution mass spectrometry will support
systems level studies of the effects of diet, nutrition and exercise on biological processes that are proposed to
mitigate the deleterious health effects of exposure to environmental pollutants. 2. To conduct biomonitoring
measurements for population health studies. The core will enable interactions between UK-SRC
investigators and collaborators who have completed or ongoing clinical/population health studies that provide
an opportunity to investigate relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes as a
conduit for clinical translation of advances made by the biomedical projects. In coordination with DMAC the
core will conduct large scale measurements of environmental chemicals, their metabolites and degradation
products and biomarkers of exposure or lifestyle associated stressors using both targeted and untargeted
approaches to examine association of environmental exposures and interventions with clinical outcomes."
10767335,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center (UK-SRC) Data Management and Analysis Core
(DMAC) has a goal to provide an overarching technology and research support infrastructure for the
management and integration of data and information assets. Given that interdisciplinary research requires
researchers to use methods and data from a range of disciplines, this goal addresses a critical need for
interdisciplinary research to overcome hurdles posed by discipline-specific methods that impede progress
when many disciplines attempt to share data. The DMAC is designed in alignment with FAIR (Findable,
Assessable, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles to encourage interaction of data users and sharing of
data. The specific aims are: 1) coordination of projects and cores; 2) foster data integration, sharing, and
interoperability; 3) ensure data quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). The datasets to be managed
and curated within the DMAC, encompass the full range of basic research to translational work, from animal-
based studies to chemical analysis, from experimental studies evaluating remediation of hazardous
substances to community engagement activities. The DMAC will engage regularly with project/core leaders to
prioritize data sets. It will streamline analytic resources, data management, data quality validation, and data
integration across projects and cores to improve efficiencies and reproducibility, enhance project coordination,
and promote resource sharing. The DMAC will promote interoperability by incorporating FAIR guiding
principles in its data dashboards, data archives, and its query exploration interface to permit projects and cores
to better integrate. By developing common terminologies, data dictionaries, training, etc., the DMAC will
facilitate a common data resource to foster sharing within, and beyond the UK-SRC. To facilitate interaction
with investigators and trainees there will be (on-site and electronic) opportunities for regular interaction with
biostatisticians, data scientists, and informaticians where formal and informal training can occur. These
activities will be coordinated and advertised closely with the Research Experience Training Coordination Core
(RETCC). The DMAC will create a new WHY ENVIRONMENT module to enable projects and cores to engage
in investigator-initiated research translation activities to allow them to form new questions and hypotheses that
can be tested in projects and cores and shared beyond the confines of UK-SRC. Lastly, the DMAC will
incorporate best practices outlined by Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE.org). It will establish a
plan for data QA/QC so that UK-SRC research will not be subjected to pitfalls associated with poor quality
data."
10767337,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The research proposed by the University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center (UK-SRC) uses basic 
biological, chemical and physical methods through nutrition and physical activity to reduce the amount and 
toxicity of hazardous substances (Superfund Research P Mandate #4). Incorporating good nutrition and 
physical activity strategies in conjunction with increasing environmental health literacy focused on nutrition and 
contaminant exposures aligns with the central theme of the UK-SRC – reducing risk posed by environmental 
contaminants in vulnerable communities – and with the prevention/intervention activities implemented by CEC. 
The CEC will continue to engage in bi-directional communication with its longest standing community partner 
of 12 years, the Harlan community located in southeastern Kentucky near the National Priorities List (NPL) 
site, in Dayhoit, Kentucky. At this NPL site, disposal of chlorinated solvents affected plant workers and 
neighbors living in a nearby mobile home park and surrounding area. New partnerships have been formed in 
eastern Kentucky, Letcher County, which has concerns related to the negative health consequences 
associated with air and water pollution derived from coal mining. The CEC also brought environmental 
pollutant and healthy lifestyle-focused interventions to older adults in central Kentucky. Although not exposed 
to a particular environmental contaminant, the older adult population is an important one to include in its 
engagement activities due to the rapid growth of this population sector. By virtue of being an older adult, these 
individuals have been exposed to more environmental contaminants and with age the detoxification capacity of 
the liver and kidneys has declined, putting older adults at greater risk of experiencing more pronounced 
negative health effects of environmental contaminants. The innovation of the CEC to engage communities is 
apparent in the six prevention/intervention activities outlined in this proposal. The six programs are grounded in 
evidence-based approaches by intervening at multiple levels of the social ecological model of health behavior 
change, including the individual, community and organizational levels, which allows the CEC to implement 
healthy lifestyle and environmental pollution education into existing community programs that reach 
populations across the lifespan. Major community partners include county Cooperative Extension Service 
Family and Consumer Science (FCS) and Horticulture Agents, county senior centers, community centers, and 
farmers markets. The CEC plans to incorporate the science of the UK-SRC into existing community programs 
including walking programs, FCS Extension health programs, gardening programs, senior center health 
programs, and youth day camp programs. The gardening program will not only foster collaboration with 
community entities, but also with the Duke SRC as it combines the expertise of both. Overall, collaboration with 
community partners will benefit residents by providing opportunities to improve health and receive new 
knowledge pertaining to using healthy lifestyles to reduce exposure to environmental contaminants."
10767338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center (UK-SRC) e addresses a major environmental issue,
focusing on halogenated organics occurring at Superfund sites and that persist in the ground and water
sources in many other locations nationwide. The Research Experience and Training Coordination Core
(RETCC) aims to train students to investigate these issues via exposing trainees to interdisciplinary
approaches to training, providing opportunities to enhance their professional career development, and through
extensive outside laboratory experiences program that coordinates opportunities for participation in the
Community Engagement Core and the Administrative Core’s research translational function, and engaging
them with the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC). These diverse activities will give the trainees
broad exposure to environmental issues that affect their surroundings and equip them with a unique toolset to
make disruptive impacts to the field. Addressing environmental challenges requires an integrative approach
that leverages knowledge from disparate disciplines and perspectives. A combination of knowledge and
scientific methods from biomedical and environmental science and engineering-based disciplines are required,
while also considering the social impact of these issues on the surrounding communities. While the RETCC
promotes strong cross-disciplinary training, it also encourages the interdisciplinary thinking needed to develop
problem-solving skills and to become effective environmental communicators. The specific aims are: 1) to
introduce innovative training components designed to spur disruptive impacts and spark creative solutions to
complex environmental problems. The RETCC will fund trainee-developed pilot grants that necessitate cross-
disciplinary collaborations (e.g., data science/bioinformatics) among the projects and cores; 2) to integrate
career development training activities critical for academic and nonacademic interests developed through
interactions with the Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science and newly developed DMAC and
offer specific skills training (responsible conduct of research and grantsmanship) that prepare students for
success in academic, governmental and industrial research careers; and 3) to increase integration of the
trainees throughout all aspects of the Center to enhance overall productivity and to expand training
opportunities, from recruitment of the next generation of trainees to reporting the Center’s activities and trainee
outcomes to the SRP."
10767340,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of Project 1 is to understand the signaling pathways and metabolic or biological changes by
which bioactive nutrients modulate impacts of acute or chronic exposure to persistent organic pollutants such
as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Such
persistent pollutants express significant chemical stability in the environment, and toxic insults from POPs are
known to correlate with a range of post-exposure human health impacts, including vascular inflammation.
Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
Biological events associated with inflammation and atherosclerosis can be modified by circulating toxicants
and bioactive nutrients and their metabolites, which dictate final redox changes and inflammatory outcomes, by
altering NF-kB and Nrf2 signaling. For example, preliminary data demonstrate down-regulation of PCB 126-
mediated toxicity and inflammation by plant-derived bioactive nutrients, e.g., polyphenols, and fiber (e.g.,
inulin). Importantly, it is known that the pathology of atherosclerosis is dependent on the health and cross-talk
of multiple tertiary organ systems including the liver and gut, as exemplified by recent findings linking PCB
exposure with increased plasma levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a diet-derived metabolite formed
through cross-talk between gut microbiota and hepatic oxidation and associated with risk of atherosclerosis.
Preliminary findings indicate that persistent organic pollutants, and especially PCBs, caused liver dysfunction
and alterations of gut microbiota, and that prior liver injury exacerbated PCB-mediated systemic inflammation.
Metabolomic profiling further suggested that increased formation of pro-atherogenic metabolites (e.g.,
ceramides) may drive multi-organ inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk. Based on these findings,
three specific aims test the hypotheses that 1) administration of PCB 126 and/or PFAS to mice increases
cardiometabolic disease risk by increasing ceramide production via modulation of hepatic gene expression
and/or the gut microbiota; 2) administration of green tea catechins and/or soluble inulin fiber in vivo decreases
ceramides and thereby stabilizes cellular redox status, modulating NF-kB and Nrf2 signaling and pro-
atherosclerotic pathologies as determined by en face and lipid staining in atherogenic LDL receptor-deficient
mice; and 3) exposure to PCBs and/or PFAS increases pro-atherogenic metabolites (e.g., ceramides) through
increased de novo synthesis in preclinical models. Transcriptomic and metabolomic technologies will be used
to explore the mechanistic interactions between pollutant exposure, nutritional intervention, and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risks. These data will be confirmed in biobanked samples of humans with CVD. Results will
support the paradigm that healthful nutrition interventions offer a powerful strategy to reduce disease risks
associated with environmental toxic insults and to prevent inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, that
have been linked to exposure to Superfund pollutants."
10886107,"Tendel’s CoTend-s3B SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccine targets T follicular helper (Tfh) cells to generate
extraordinarily broad and long-lived antibody responses, which are required for resilient vaccines that
maintain protection over long periods. The vaccine candidate incorporates the “s3” targeting moiety, which
induces a potent T follicular helper (Tfh) cell response. This novel, first-in-class adjuvant is fused to the receptor
binding domain (RBD) from the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (BA.4/BA.5). The combined molecule
simultaneously targets RBD-specific B cells and T cells, and especially local Tfh cells, thus accelerating and
expanding B-cell development. Preclinical non-human primate (NHP) studies have demonstrated extraordinarily
high neutralizing antibody titers that were stable for >10 months when delivered via a low dose of adenovirus
type 35 (Ad35) delivery vector. In contrast, neutralizing antibody responses to control vaccine lacking the s3
moiety (i.e., CoTend-B containing immunogen alone), were diminished to below the level of protection within 6
months, similar to results seen in humans with FDA-approved mRNA vaccines.
In cooperation with academic partners Steve Deeks (UCSF) and Kara Chew (UCLA), Tendel completed
favorable pre-IND interactions for this s3-adjuvanted vaccine and designed a first-in-human trial. In this R44
application we propose several tasks that will provide the needed investigational products and toxicology data,
as well as additional supportive mechanistic data, to support comparative phase-1 testing of CoTend-B and
CoTend-s3B as booster vaccines beginning in early 2024. We will complete GMP-grade production of both
vaccines in amounts sufficient for both GLP safety studies and the planned phase-1 trial. We will test the
technical feasibility of adventitious-agent testing by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Finally, we will use the
vialed vaccine to complete GLP safety studies in macaques while simultaneously gathering high-dimensional
repertoire data to demonstrate superior B-cell recruitment by the s3 adjuvant platform.
The deliverables of this work are fully characterized, GMP-grade vaccine stocks (CoTend-B and CoTend-s3B)
and corresponding safety data that will permit a successful IND application and commencement of clinical trials.
Aim 1. Produce vialed CoTend-B and CoTend-s3B vaccine products according to GMP.
Aim 2. Complete release testing, including adventitious-agent testing by an NGS approach.
Aim 3. Perform GLP toxicology and immunogenicity testing of the vialed product.
The work proposed in this R44 application will enable necessary steps towards the first test in humans of a new
approach to promoting development of antigen-specific B cells. If successful, de-risking of the s3 platform will
provide a transformative new tool that can enable and drive human B-cell development along paths that are
infrequently reached by current vaccines."
10767982,"Project Summary
Cellular senescence is a programmed growth arrest activated by irreparable extrinsic or intrinsic stresses.
Senescence can be beneficial in certain circumstances, such as tissue homeostasis during embryonic
development or tumor suppression. However, if persistently secreted by senescent cells, the proinflammatory
cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and growth factors are actually major drivers for aging and age-associated
diseases and, paradoxically, promote tumorigenesis. Genetic or pharmacological clearance of senescent cells
effectively improves lifespan and healthspan in rodent models. As such, targeting senescence has emerged as
a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat aging comorbidities and cancer. However, how the
irreversible senescence program is induced and maintained in stressed cells remains poorly understood.
 Cells utilize primary cilia to convert environmental cues into diverse cellular signalings that govern
proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. Cilia dysfunction leads to a wide spectrum of syndromic
disorders that are collectively termed ciliopathies. Using irradiation, we discovered that stressed human
fibroblasts or epithelial cells exhibit transient cilia biogenesis. Strikingly, FBF1, a component of transition fibers
(TFs) at the ciliary base, unexpectedly translocates to promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in
stressed cells. PML-NBs are highly dynamic proteinaceous nuclear structures with instrumental roles in
regulating stress-induced responses, including senescence and apoptosis. FBF1 depletion effectively
abolishes stress-induced PML-NB upregulation and associated senescence initiation, whereas FBF1
overexpression shows the opposite effects. Our initial studies indicated that the stress-induced PML-NB
translocation of FBF1 is regulated by a distinct cilia module comprising Joubert syndrome proteins ARL3 and
ARL13B and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9. Further proteomic studies revealed novel FBF1
interactors (PML, 53BP1, and BRD4) implicated in PML-NB biogenesis and/or function. Remarkably,
Fbf1tm1a/tm1a mice exhibit a significantly reduced senescence burden throughout life and could be further
protected against irradiation-induced frailty. Our preliminary data thus suggest an exciting paradigm that a
stress-induced TF-to-PML-NB translocation of ciliary protein FBF1 is essential for senescence
initiation in mammalian cells. Here, we propose to use complementary approaches to address mechanistic
questions, including how the ciliary ARL3-ARL13B-UBC9 module regulates FBF1 SUMOylation and PML-NB
translocation (Aim 1), and how PML-NB-associated FBF1 promotes senescence in stressed cells (Aim 2).
Together with the extended analysis of the physiological importance of FBF1 pathway in in vivo senescence
mouse models (Aim 3), this project will potentially bridge the fundamental discovery to the next generation of
therapeutic strategies for preventing or treating senescence-associated pathologies."
10768154,"Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation Summary
The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) will build on its strong leadership and processes developed in the current
funding cycle to further strengthen its basic, translational, and clinical Research Programs and apply them to
meeting the needs of our catchment population and beyond.
The MCC Director, Dr. Douglas Yee, and the Deputy Director, Dr. Jeffrey Miller, will continue in their roles. In
the past 5 years, several other leadership positions have been modified or added to meet the changing needs
of the MCC. A new Associate Director position has been created to provide oversight of Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion (DEI) and leadership as the MCC implements its plan to enhance participation of women, minorities,
and underrepresented groups in the Center’s workforce and leadership. The Associate Director for Basic
Sciences now oversees the Basic Shared Resources, and the Associate Director for Clinical Affairs is now the
Associate Director for Clinical Research, overseeing all clinical research functions of the Center, including the
Clinical Trials Office and other clinical research resources. New recruits have filled the positions of Associate
Directors of Administration, Basic Sciences, Clinical Research, Community Outreach and Engagement,
Education, and Translational Research.
Since the last competitive renewal, MCC undertook an extensive strategic planning process, which culminated
in the release of a refreshed 5-year Strategic Plan in 2022 driven by 3 elements central to the mission and
vision of the Center: 1) Engage in the research strengths of MCC research members, 2) Enhance integration of
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion across the center, 3) Proactively develop and retain the next generation of new
leadership, faculty and staff, 4) Incorporate catchment and care provider input into MCC activities.
The overall goal was to ensure that these elements of the Center’s mission and vision are embedded
throughout the Plan. Therefore, governance structures, evaluation metrics, and associated resources were
revised to align with each area of the Plan. As a result of this process, 4 strategic pillars and areas for a
cascading strategic plan were formulated based on a combination of stakeholder interviews, comprehensive
reviews of previous strategic plans, ecosystem partner objectives, an inventory of current state activities, and
future state objectives. Those 4 pillars are: Reduce the Cancer Burden in Minnesota and beyond, Drive
Research Discovery, Accelerate the Path to Cures, and Enable Research Excellence.
MCC will continue to receive input from its External Advisory Board annually and will leverage institutional
leadership and engage key stakeholders in support of the Center’s Aims to 1) Guide cancer research at the
University of Minnesota, 2) Provide vision and oversight for the MCC Strategic Plan, and 3) Evaluate progress
and adjust our efforts accordingly to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of MCC."
10768155,"Clinical Protocol and Data Management Summary
The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) provides comprehensive and integrated resources to help cancer
researchers develop and conduct interventional clinical trials, including translational development, clinical
research services, regulatory support, protocol development, and trial management and monitoring. The MCC
Clinical Trials Office (CTO) was established in 2001 to enhance MCC members’ ability to conduct clinical
cancer research. It assists investigators in developing, activating, and completing scientifically meritorious
clinical trials in a high-quality, cost-effective, and efficient manner. At the same time, the CTO ensures the
validity and integrity of data to fulfill all NCI, federal, and local regulatory requirements, through the aims of 1)
delivering high-quality support services to facilitate efficient implementation and conduct of clinical trials for all
Cancer Center investigators, 2) continually implementing strategies to improve trial activation timelines and
effectively engage disease-specific teams to monitor the performance of the clinical trial portfolio to optimize
accrual, and 3) ensuring continued and expanded access to clinical trials within the community by optimizing a
centralized infrastructure to meet the needs of our diverse population and support community partnerships
across Minnesota and beyond. The CTO is led by Associate Director for Clinical Research (AD) Melissa
Geller, MD, MS (Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program), and Executive Director of Clinical Research,
Dedra Schendzielos, MHA, who provide senior leadership and operations oversight. Dr. Geller was appointed
AD in January 2022 to transform the CTO to serve growing faculty interest in complex early-phase clinical
trials. Ms. Schendzielos began her position in June 2021. Over the past 5 years, there were 563 active clinical
trials using CTO services, 219 of which were investigator-initiated. During the pandemic, the CTO pivoted to
work toward a more equitable, accessible, and efficient clinical research process. We developed strategies to
minimize burdens on research sites and participants. Many aspects of clinical research evolved to using
electronic tools, including remote signing of research documents and telehealth clinical encounters. From
March 2020 to March 2022, we adapted our protocols and procedures to ensure safe and continual
recruitment, and the initiation of remote work options stabilized staff turnover, with a 47% decrease in
departures. The CTO has added new staff roles and additional staff to existing roles to support the growth in
complex clinical trials. It also successfully implemented a new Developmental Therapeutics Initiative (DTI)
focused on expanded access to early-phase clinical trials and on the translational aspects of this research.
Over the next 5 years, we will focus our efforts on building out the DTI. We have resources dedicated to hire a
program nurse lead for the DTI and have instituted a FastTrack team to focus on getting early-phase clinical
trials open to accrual in ~100 days. With this strategy, we will decrease our time to open and increase our
accrual numbers."
10768156,"Protocol Review and Monitoring System Summary
The Cancer Protocol Review Committee (CPRC), Interdisciplinary Site-Specific Care (ISC) teams, and Clinical
Trials Office (CTO) Senior Leadership Team (SLT) function as the Protocol Review and Monitoring System
(PRMS) for the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC). The CPRC, ISC teams, and CTO SLT are responsible for
reviewing all hypothesis-driven protocols involving human subjects with cancer or at risk of developing cancer.
The goals of these committees are to ensure that studies are feasible and have scientific merit.
Protocol review takes place in 2 stages. First, the disease-specific ISC team evaluates the study to ensure
accrual goals are feasible, competing trials have been addressed, adequate funding is in place, and study
prioritization is considered (IIT > cooperative group > industry). In July 2022, the CTO SLT was added to the
feasibility review process to provide a review of CTO staffing and to grant final approval of feasibility. The CTO
SLT review was added to satisfy a new mandate by the Dean of the Medical School for a Departmental Clinical
Research Resource Review (CR3). Prior to the Medical School implementing the CR3 process, the CPRC sent
a feasibility review form to ISC Team Chairs for completion prior to the CPRC meeting.
In the second stage of review, the CPRC reviews scientific quality and merit. The CPRC reviews the adequacy
of the objectives, treatment plan, study justification, statistical plan, data and safety monitoring plan, and
accrual goals. Protocols must receive CPRC approval or stipulated approval with permission to proceed with
the Institutional Review Board application and submission.
The CPRC is also responsible for continuing review of scientific progress and accrual throughout a trial’s
enrollment period. The CPRC may disapprove or close a study for lack of scientific or accrual progress. Annual
review of all CPRC-approved studies begins 1 year after the initial CPRC approval date. The annual accrual
minimum has been increased to 35% of the projected goal. If a protocol does not meet the accrual threshold, if
scientific merit is in question, or if there has been a delay in study activation, a letter is sent to the PI requesting
justification.
The CPRC is composed of members with scientific expertise in solid tumors, hematology, blood and marrow
transplant, pediatrics, epidemiology, pharmacology, and cancer prevention and control to encompass the
portfolio of research conducted at the MCC. Co-Chairs of the committee are appointed by MCC Executive
Leadership. The ISC teams are composed of faculty and staff representatives from disease specific disciplines
who currently serve as treating physicians, Advanced Practice Providers (APP), or study staff within that
disease portfolio. The CTO SLT is composed of senior MCC and CTO leadership."
10768157,"Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource Summary
The goals of the Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource (ABSR) are to provide access to state-of-the-art
mass spectrometry, advanced data analysis, and validated biomarker quantitative assay services to members
of the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC). These goals are met through 3 Specific Aims: 1) Through the Mass
Spectrometry Laboratory services, provide expertise on trace analysis of biologically important compounds,
including DNA adductomic, exposomic, metabolomic, and proteomic services; 2) Through the Bioinformatics
and Advanced Data Analysis services, process and analyze large and complex mass spectrometry -omics data
sets, including DNA adductomics, exposomics, metabolomics, and proteomics data, and support and train
users in the use of advanced data analysis software tools; and 3) Through the Biomarker Quantitation service,
offer sensitive and quantitative methods for determining numerous chemical exposures in human urine, blood,
or DNA.
The members of MCC rely on ABSR staff for maintenance of instrumentation, guidance on related projects,
method development, chromatography, and troubleshooting analytical problems. The Resource teaches and
trains new users, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, on chemical analyses and mass
spectrometric methods. New users receive one-on-one training from the staff on hands-on operation of both
instrumentation and software. After training, the new users are usually capable of semi-independent use of

Lipid signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of organismal physiology and metabolic expenditure.
Imbalances in lipid homeostasis can deleteriously impact health and cells within the organism tightly regulate
lipid absorption, synthesis and metabolism to accommodate energetic demands and ensure energetic reserves
later in life. Cells stockpile energy reserves under ample metabolic resources through SREBP-regulated
lipogenesis. Yet, less clear is how cells regulate lipid homeostasis under nutrient depleted conditions and in
particular, how cells sense metabolic demand and respond by increasing nutrient absorption. Our examination
of several lipid depletion paradigms in C. elegans has identified a highly responsive small G protein, RAB-11.2,
which is transcriptionally activated upon defects in the isoprenoid/mevalonate synthesis pathway. Through
further investigation, we have discovered a new mechanism linking the nucleocytoplasmic dynamics of the
nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49, with nutrient absorption through RAB-11.2.
Through the proposed five-year research period, we aim to define the molecular mechanism by which cells sense
and respond to their need for de novo lipid synthesis. Our preliminary data suggests that cells sense their
capacity to breakdown lipids through monitoring the availability of a particular prenol lipid synthesized through
the isoprenoid pathway, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Under conditions of high homeostatic lipid levels,
geranylgeranylation of RAB-11.1 enables it to bind and sequester NHR-49 to cytosolic transport vesicles in a
transcriptionally inactive state. Under lipid limited conditions caused by starvation or defective lipolysis/β-
oxidation, cells lack the resources to synthesize GGPP through the isoprenoid pathway, which prevents RAB-
11.1 from binding vesicles and disrupts endocytic recycling pathways required for nutrient absorption. Due to the
inability of its RAB-11.1 binding partner to associate with vesicles, NHR-49 is release from cytosolic vesicles and
translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of several metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters
and RAB-11.2 to re-establish nutrient absorption."
10770562,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a human gamma-herpesvirus, is the causative agent of AIDS
malignancies like KS and primary effusion lymphomas (PEL). In recent years it became clear that pathogenic
herpesviruses including EBV, KSHV, and MHV68 express numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) many of
which are in antisense orientation to protein coding transcripts. The function and structure of these RNAs is
largely unknown. In addition, these viruses express microRNAs (miRNAs). While characterizing the KSHV
miRNA targetomes using a modified Crosslinking and Sequencing of Hybrids (qCLASH) protocol, we identified
several hundred host cellular lncRNAs as putative miRNA targets. These data strongly suggest that both KSHV
encoded proteins and miRNAs contribute to dysregulation of host lncRNAs. Importantly, 34 lncRNAs that are
perturbed following KSHV infection, including MALAT1, HOTTIP, ANRIL, Meg3, UCA1 and GAS-5 are reported
to be associated with human cancers. We also linked both mRNA and lncRNA targets to cancer hallmark
phenotypes such as proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism, and started to identify
signaling pathways that are perturbed by KSHV miRNAs in human endothelial cells as a model for KS. We also
identified aberrant splicing as an additional cancer hallmark phenotype. Here we propose to extend our studies
by integrating multi-omics data sets from qCLASH, RNAseq and miRNAseq data to comprehensively analyze
miRNA-regulated gene regulatory networks in KSHV infected endothelial cells. Moreover, we propose to validate
our findings in a significant number of human tumor samples and by generating the first KS tumor miRNA
targetome by qCLASH. These studies will be performed in a comparative fashion with Projects 2 and 3 and
furthermore will be supported by Cores B, C, and D. In addition, we are functionally studying the role of the
antisense LANA transcript (ALT) for which we have identified 81 putative binding proteins using a highly
innovative RNA-pulldown assay. Moreover, we will study the role of a newly identified class of viral circular RNAs
that has been discovered by this program. In summary, the goal of this project is to delineate the role of viral
lncRNAs and host cellular lncRNAs that are perturbed by viral infection in AIDS malignancies."
10770564,"Summary
The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a causal agent in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric
cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and autoimmune diseases. In the context of HIV co-infection (+ or - ART),
EBV is especially problematic with a substantially elevated risk of EBV-associated lymphomas. The overall
objective of this P01 is to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs in HIV-associated malignancies. Our
assessment of EBV-associated Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) and gastric cancer (GC) patient datasets revealed that
outside of the ubiquitously expressed small EBER1/2 non-coding viral RNAs, in vivo viral gene expression is
primarily limited to two overlapping long non-coding RNAs, A73 and RPMS1 and two large miRNA clusters
contained within the RPMS1 introns. Strikingly, we found that viral miRNAs comprise up to 75% of all miRNAs
expressed in the cell in both BL and GC clinical samples. MiRNA targetome analyses revealed that EBV (and
KSHV (Project 1)) miRNAs interact more effectively with their targets than their cellular counterparts, in part
through targeting more accessible regions of RNAs and through forming hybrids with more favorable binding
energies. Functionally, we found that EBV miRNAs likely suppress innate and adaptive immune responses to
viral infection. Together, these studies support the contention that EBV miRNAs are key contributors to the
tumor phenotype in EBV associated lymphomas.
Although certain cell miRNAs are known oncogenes, there is extensive evidence for a generalized lower
expression of cell miRNAs in cancer. Further, driver mutations in miRNA processing genes have been
identified in a number of cancer types. Utilizing patient RNA-seq data, we found that cell miRNA processing is
diminished in EBV positive tumors and we show that expression of EBV miRNA clusters in EBV negative cells
causes decreased processing of endogenous cell miRNAs. We hypothesize that the introduction of multiple
copies of ectopic high-density miRNA clusters into cells upon EBV infection not only yields high viral miRNA
production but also causes sequestration of microprocessor resources and inhibited processing of cell
miRNAs. We further hypothesize that viral microprocessor inhibition diminishes the expression of cell tumor
suppressor miRNAs to influence the tumor phenotype in a manner similar to genetic alterations of miRNA
processing factor genes.
In this proposal, we will use bench work, viral recombineering (Core C), and bioinformatics (Core B) in tissue
culture, animal models (Core D), and clinical models to 1) determine the functional impact of direct viral miRNA
targeting on immune regulatory pathways and 2) delineate the underlying mechanisms, the impacted
oncogenic pathways, and the functional consequence of EBV-mediated microprocessor overload on the tumor
phenotype. We will also begin preliminary studies to determine whether microprocessor overload is a shared
feature extending to other oncogenic herpesviruses through testing the KSHV (Project 1) miRNA cluster."
10770566,"Project Summary
The transforming human gammaherpesviruses EBV and KSHV establish stable latent infections in B cells,
providing a lifelong reservoir of virus that can contribute to the development of malignant disease. Thus, defining
the mechanisms that govern long-term latency and tumorigenesis is critical for designing rational strategies to
prevent disease. In vivo studies of gammaherpesviruses in humans have been severely limited by the difficulties
of working in the natural host. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is related to EBV and KSHV and causes
lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disease in mice, providing a readily manipulatable small animal model for
mechanistic studies of the virus/host relationship in vivo. Like EBV and KSHV, MHV68 expresses multiple forms
of ncRNAs whose functions during infection and pathogenesis are largely unknown. In contrast to most
gammaherpesvirus protein-coding genes, gammaherpesvirus ncRNAs are abundantly expressed in vivo during
chronic infection and in hyperplastic lesions during lymphoproliferative disease, suggesting that these ncRNAs
may play key conserved roles in latency and tumorigenesis. In support of this, we have demonstrated that
MHV68 TMER4 and EBV EBER1 share a conserved function in hematogenous dissemination, and that in vivo
suppression of a conserved miRNA target promotes B cell latency. Further, our new preliminary findings implicate
both small ncRNAs and miRNAs in the genesis and progression of virus-induced B cell lymphoma. Thus, we
hypothesize that gammaherpesviruses utilize a broad array of ncRNAs to shape critical B cell signaling pathways
and thereby promote virus dissemination, latency and tumorigenesis. In Aim 1 (in collaboration with Project 2
and with support from Cores C and D), we will define the mechanisms by which gammaherpesvirus small RNAs
promote the egress and dissemination of infected B cells, facilitate B cell latency at peripheral sites, and drive
key stages of lymphomagenesis. In Aim 2 (in collaboration with Projects 2 and 3, and with support from Cores
B, C and D) we will define the contribution of gammaherpesvirus miRNA repression of host mRNAs and lncRNAs
to B cell latency and lymphomagenesis. The highly collaborative nature of this program, along with the systematic
in vivo analyses of ncRNA mutants and recombinant viruses carrying EBV or KSHV genes, provides an
extremely powerful means to determine the specific molecular mechanisms by which ncRNAs contribute to
gammaherpesvirus latency and tumorigenesis."
10770472,"Project Summary/Abstract
With age, humans can accumulate leukocyte clones in blood that arise from somatic mutations in bone marrow
stem cells that enhance expansion: clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Mutations in
DNMT3A and TET2 account for the plurality of these clones. CHIP confers highly elevated cardiovascular (CV)
risk, independent of traditional risk factors. We have found accelerated atherogenesis and the involvement of
IL-1 and IL-6 in mice with myeloid loss of Tet2 or Dnmt3a function and that genetically reduced IL-6 signaling
abrogates the elevated CV risk in humans with DNMT3A or TET2 CHIP. Analyses of our CANTOS trial showed
greater efficacy of IL-1β inhibition in humans with DNMT3A or TET2 CHIP. These results point the way to a
genotype-directed allocation of therapy, an approach that has transformed oncology but remains aspirational in
atherosclerosis. The roles of classical vs. trans IL-6 signaling in atherothrombosis requires further study due to
conflicting evidence. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that atherosclerotic mice that mimic CHIP due to
myeloid deficiency in Dnmt3a treated with an antibody that interrupts global IL-6 signaling by neutralizing IL-6
receptor α (IL-6r, CD126) have decreased atherosclerosis and inflammation within the lesions, blood and other
organs as gauged in part by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We further hypothesize that IL-6r
inhibition will limit expansion of the mutant clone. Specific aim 2 will probe the role of classical vs. trans IL-6
signaling in myeloid cells in accelerated atherogenesis in CHIP using Il6rflox/flox/Lyz2-Cre mice bone marrow
chimeric LDLR-/- mice (to block leukocyte classical signaling), and administration of a gp130-IgG1-Fc chimeric
protein (to block trans signaling) using similar procedures and endpoints. The results will illuminate the
controversy and unsettled science regarding the contributions of classical and trans IL-6 signaling to
atherogenesis. Specific aim 3. Our preliminary experiments show that female myeloidTet2-/-Ldlr-/- mice have
greater acceleration of atherogenesis than Tet2+/+ Ldlr-/- male mice and, unlike their male counterparts, show
reduced atherogenesis with IL-1β neutralization. We will localize where this sex difference operates in the
inflammasome–IL-1β–IL-6 pathway, and test the hypothesis that female Dnmt3a-/-Ldlr-/- mice have greater
response to IL-6r inhibition than males. We will probe mechanisms by gonadal ablation experiments and by
analysis of scRNA-seq data, which in preliminary data shows IL-1β expression in resident macrophages cells
from atheroma from Tet2-/- females but not males. This work will deepen understanding of the mechanisms of
accelerated atherosclerosis in CHIP. Our new pilot clinical data show that an anti-IL-6 antibody can mute
inflammation in humans. Thus, the work proposed here will provide an indispensable step toward validating
and furnishing the fundamental basis of an immediately translatable targeted therapeutic strategy based on
CHIP genotype."

This application requests continued funding for a postdoctoral research training program in hematology that
has been successful in attracting young scientists and physician-scientists into academic careers in
hematology. The program has as its primary objective to prepare MD, MD/PhD, and PhD postdoctoral fellows
for productive careers in the hematology research workforce. We are requesting support for four postdoctoral
trainees per year (two PhD trainees and two MD or MD/PhD trainees), which is unchanged from the previous
grant period. Under the leadership of MPIs Steven Lentz and Anil Chauhan, the training will be carried out in
an enriched environment of active basic, translational and clinical investigation at an institution that
emphasizes the career development and collaborative science. We aim to recruit outstanding postdoctoral
trainees, of diverse gender, ethnicity and culture, who wish to obtain comprehensive knowledge of the
principles and techniques of basic and translational research related to hematology, blood cells, vascular
biology, coagulation, hematopoiesis, and immunobiology, and prepare them for successful careers as
independent investigators or related scientific positions. We have defined six specific objectives for trainees
that are linked to measurable outputs in our evidenced-based evaluation process. Upon completion of the
program, trainees will be able to: (1) Integrate knowledge of basic mechanisms, research methods, and clinical
hematology to identify the most significant and impactful research questions; (2) Demonstrate critical thinking
and reasoning in the conduct of research; (3) Demonstrate integrity and rigor in the conduct of research; (4)
Demonstrate skills in oral and written communication, including grant applications and publications; (5)
Recognize the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion; (6) Demonstrate skills in leadership and
mentoring. Several new initiatives have been instituted, including expansion of the clinical hematology
fellowship and creation of an advanced hematology fellowship track, closer partnership with the PSTP (a
robust pipeline for physician-scientist trainees), a new scientific focus on thrombo-inflammation and stroke, and
implementation of structured individualized career mentoring. The curriculum includes core lectures in clinical
hematology, research methods, RCR, rigor and reproducibility, and grant writing. Mentoring committees and
individual development plans are required for all trainees. The foundation of training continues to be centered
on the individual mentored research project, marked by a period of intensive, sustained research under the
guidance of an established, dedicated mentor. The rich training environment provided by the diverse faculty,
extensive laboratory, clinical, and core facilities, and strong institutional support should ensure continued
success in attracting and preparing highly qualified postdoctoral trainees for careers in hematology research."
10770367,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer that frequently carries an
integrated copy of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and expresses viral transforming antigens (TAgs) that
likely play a key role in tumorigenesis. MCC tumor cells also express transcripts detected in normal, post-
mitotic Merkel cells residing in skin, including a set of mRNAs encoding lineage-specific transcription factors
implicated in neuroendocrine cell fate. Work from our lab and others established that MCPyV small T antigen
(sTAg), +/- truncated large T antigen (tLTAg), is sufficient to drive transformation in vivo, but MCC-like
tumors were not detected in any of these models despite TAg targeting to various potential tumor progenitor.
The lack of a viable mouse model of MCC has been a major impediment to progress in this field.
 Normal Merkel cells arise from epidermal progenitors in specialized cellular compartments called touch
domes, but the cell of origin of MCC is unknown. In an effort to override the apparent resistance of multiple
cell types to MCPyV TAg-driven MCC development in genetically-engineered mice, we generated mice co-
expressing the Merkel cell transcription factor Atoh1, together with MCPyV TAgs, in epidermal keratinocytes.
These mice developed small collections of proliferating MCC-like tumor cells, and when coupled with deletion
of one copy of p53, yielded gross tumors strikingly similar to human MCCs based on multiple criteria. Given
the pivotal role of Atoh1 in MCC tumorigenesis we performed complementary loss-of-function studies, and
discovered that Atoh1 knock-down converts human MCC cells from their typical neuroendocrine phenotype
and growth in suspension, to cells with adherent growth, loss of neuroendocrine markers, and more aggressive
behavior in vivo.
 We thus hypothesize that Atoh1 and other transcription factors governing Merkel cell fate play a pivotal role
in MCC pathogenesis as well as maintenance of the neuroendocrine tumor phenotype. We propose the
following aims to test this hypothesis. 1) Generate and characterize MCC-like tumors driven by MCPyV TAg
expression targeted to candidate MCC progenitor cells. 2) Determine whether MCPyV TAg expression is
required for mouse MCC maintenance. 3) Examine the role of Merkel cell lineage transcription factors in
governing neuroendocrine cell fate and biological behavior of human MCC cell lines. These studies will yield
new insights into the molecular basis of MCC and validate a much-needed mouse model of MCC."

The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) seeks its first renewal of its “Cancer
Prevention and Control Training Program” (CPCTP) for postdoctoral fellows. The philosophy of this program is
to foster transdisciplinary team science training through high quality mentorship to reduce the cancer burden in
high-priority areas in our communities and beyond. This is done by providing state-of-the-art research training
across the cancer control spectrum from the laboratory to the clinic and community, high quality research
infrastructure, and relevant didactic course work. The co-Program Directors (co-PDs) are Drs. Peter Shields
(Deputy Director, OSUCCC) and Chyke Doubeni (newly recruited to OSUCCC as Associate Director for
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion). Dr. Ce Shang is the Associate Program Director (APD). The transdisciplinary
training includes an emphasis on dual mentorship, transdisciplinary mentorship and biostatistical/bioinformatics
advisors. During the current grant cycle, there were several enhancements of the program including: 1)
formalizing the mentoring team structure; 2) enabling early stage investigators to serve as primary mentors
with senior mentor support; 3) securing an additional $3000 salary stipend through institutional funding; 4)
expansion to Nationwide Children’s Hospital for a lifespan approach including research on adolescents and
young adults; and, 5) securing an additional fellow slot with institutional funding. Despite the challenges of the
COVID-19 pandemic, all goals were met for training. To date, there have been 9 fellows enrolled in the
program, 2 who have completed their training and are now in academic tenure track positions, and 2
completing their training with offers for academic appointments. Among the fellows, 78% were women, and
33% were from disadvantaged communities or were an under-represented minority. Five of 9 were recruited
from other institutions. In the next cycle, we will: 1) increase the number of slots from 3 per year to 4 per year
(plus the one slot funded through institution support, total 5); 2) develop a new course for Cancer Prevention
and Control; 3) begin a yearly scientific symposium for current and former fellows; 4) provide funding to fellows
for the use of shared resources; and, 5) enhance efforts to recruit and retain under-represented minority
fellows under the leadership of Dr. Doubeni. The CPCTP has internal and external advisory committees. There
are 39 mentors (including 13 early career mentors [ECM]), all of whom have track records for peer-review
funding (ECM have career development awards). Particular strengths among the faculty include expertise in
carcinogenesis, cancer risk, behavioral interventions, survivorship, nutrition, health equity, community-engaged
research and tobacco control. While the OSU has several other training programs, there are essentially none
that overlap with the CPCTP. The training program would be administratively managed through the OSUCCC
Center for Cancer Mentoring, Education, Leadership, and Oncology-related Training (CAMELOT), a
comprehensive resource established in 2018. Plans are in place for ongoing trainee, mentor and the overall
program evaluations."
10773534,"Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) affect millions of people in the US, and PNI with large gaps require surgical repair.
Although biological and synthetic grafts are widely used to repair PNI with large gaps, they both can suffer from
suboptimal clinical outcomes. Autografts are the gold standard treatment but are limited by availability and defect
repair size, while synthetic grafts have poor biodegradability, strength, bioactivity, and functionality. Thus, the
long-term objective of this proposal is to engineer grafts with enhanced large-gap nerve regeneration capabilities.
Physical and chemical stimulation can enhance nerve regeneration responses, thus, incorporating these
modalities into engineered grafts may address some current treatment limitations. Electrical stimulation (ES) can
enhance nerve conduction, neurotrophin release, and functional recovery of nerve crush injuries, but these
benefits have not been established for large-gap PNI. Chemical stimulation using 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; a
potassium channel blocker) appears similar to ES in its effects on neurons and can enhance crush PNI repair,
yet may act synergistically with ES. Implementing these physical and chemical cues for effective large-gap PNI
repair will require surgical insertion of an electrically conductive scaffold with appropriate mechanical strength,
degradation, conductivity, and pore properties. This proposal aims to deliver 4-AP and ES via novel,
biodegradable, ionically conducting (IC) chitosan scaffolds and hybrid-engineered nerve allografts to repair large-
gap nerve defects. We found that IC scaffolds with ES+4-AP treatment in large-gap nerve defects increased
neurotrophin release, myelination, compound action potential, and gastrocnemius muscle weight beyond ES or
4-AP alone. Increased blood vessel growth and reduced fiber capsule thickness surrounding scaffolds with
ES+4-AP treatment indicate improved biocompatibility and regeneration. Significantly higher levels of genes for
TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptors and NGF, BDNF, NT3, and CD31 were found for ES+4AP treatment important
for nerve regeneration. Therefore, it was hypothesized that IC scaffolds combined with chemical and electrical
cues will modulate cell-material interactions to enhance axon regeneration rate and functional recovery
comparable to autografts. This will be tested with three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize ionically conducting (IC)
scaffolds with variations in drug release rate, conductivity, and biodegradation; 2) Assess human and rat
Schwann cell responses to IC scaffolds with 4-AP and/or ES in vitro to model in vivo responses and future
interventions; and 3) Test long-term safety and efficacy of engineered scaffolds and allografts with 4-AP +/- ES
in a critical-sized sciatic nerve defect. Engineered repair of large-gap PNI using bioactive electrical and chemical
cues will broadly impact the field. These studies will bridge the knowledge gap between the complex ES-
mediated cell-material interaction microenvironment and poorly studied underlying regeneration pathways.
These findings may improve the treatment of nerve defects, and inform exploratory work on regenerative
strategies for innervation in other musculoskeletal tissues."
10775713,"Abstract
The adaptive immune system has the capacity to recognize and kill malignant cells. However, immune tolerant
mechanisms that normally protect healthy tissues from autoimmune attack prevent the development of
effective anti-tumor immunity. Tumor uses numerous immunosuppressive mechanisms to evade otherwise
effective T-cell responses. A growing number of immune evasion mechanisms have been characterized
including molecular and cellular mechanisms. Despite promising results achieved by targeting one or more of
these immune evasion mechanisms, there is clearly room for improvement since only a subset of cancer
patients usually respond to such a treatment. The PIM kinases have been studied extensively in tumorigenesis
and as potential therapeutic targets for various cancers. PIM kinases are also expressed on activated T cells,
but their roles in T-cell activity and function are inconclusive and the functions of each isoform in these cells
remain unclear. Using genetically mutant mice, we found that individual PIM kinases play unique as well as
overlapping roles in T-cell response to alloantigens. Strikingly, we consistently observed that PIM-2-deficient T
cells had significantly increased ability to induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone
marrow transplantation (BMT). More importantly, we found that CD8 T cells mount substantially strong anti-
tumor responses when PIM-2 was deficient or blocked. Our preliminary studies have been extended from
genetic to pharmacologic approaches and from mouse to human T cells. Thus, our preliminary studies provide
compelling evidence that PIM-2 serves as a powerful negative regulator of T-cell immunity against cancer. Our
Central Hypothesis is that targeting PIM-2 substantially promotes cancer immunotherapy while potentially
inhibiting tumor progression directly. This hypothesis will be tested in the following two Specific Aims: 1) To
delineate mechanistic action by which PIM-2 negatively regulates T-cell response; 2) To validate PIM-2 as an
immunotherapy target against cancer. Based on our compelling preliminary data demonstrating for the first
time that PIM-2 negatively regulates T-cell immunity, we expect to firmly validate this observation and to define
the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this regulation occurs. We also expect to demonstrate that
blockade or inhibition of PIM-2 will enhance anti-tumor immunity against different types of cancer mediated by
both mouse and human T cells."

Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT) is defined by a recurrent chromosomal translocation that
creates a chimeric transcription factor, EWS-WT1, which is the only known oncogenic driver of DSRCT.
Unfortunately, oncogenic transcription factors such as EWS-WT1 are difficult to target for therapy. Given
that standard treatments are not very effective for DSRCT (less than15% 5 year survival), development of
rationale-based targeted therapy is urgently needed. To do so, new vulnerable oncogenic targets
downstream of EWS-WT1 must be identified. Unfortunately, not much is known about the potential
vulnerable targets in DSRCT. To identify the vulnerabilities in DSRCT, we performed integrative gene
expression analysis using expression profiles of EWS-WT1-depleted DSRCT cells and 28 primary DSRCT
samples. This analysis identified several kinases that could be critical for DSRCT cell growth and survival.
Most cancers contain a small population of tumor initiating cells (TICs) that are thought to serve as seeds
for recurrent tumor growth, but TICs have not yet been identified in DSRCT. We have recently identified a
novel culture condition that produces spheroids in DSRCT which display significantly higher tumor-seeding
activity than the adherent cells. Deep RNA sequencing analysis of spheroids has revealed a number of
kinases that are enriched in spheroids. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to identify key vulnerabilities in
DSRCT that will ultimately lead to development of rationale-based targeted therapy.
Aim 1. Investigate the identified kinases as potential vulnerabilities in DSRCT. We have identified NTRK3,
ROCK2 and SIK1 kinases that are highly expressed in primary DSRCT tumors and in DSRCT cells. We will
investigate the effects of inhibiting these kinases on DSRCT cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
Aim 2. Investigate the roles of BLK, NTRK3 and ROCK2 in spheroids. Our deep RNA sequencing analysis
of highly tumorigenic spheroids has revealed a number of kinases whose expression is greatly increased in
spheroids. We will investigate the effects of inhibiting these kinases in tumorigenic capacity of spheroids
using our orthotopic intraperitoneal DSRCT xenograft model.
DSRCT remains untreatable with unacceptably high mortality. Our integrative gene expression analysis
and our recent discovery of spheroids in DSRCT have revealed several kinases that could be critical for
DSRCT growth or survival. These complementary approaches will ultimately lead to development of
durable targeted therapies in DSRCT. Our integrative approach in identifying vulnerable targets could be
applied to finding critical dependencies in other related pediatric sarcomas such as Ewing sarcoma."
10778188,"Project Summary/Abstract: Skin and soft tissue infections are a major public health threat.
Exacerbating the problem has been the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. Like
the hide of an animal, human skin creates a physical barrier between a person and its environment. The
skin is also home to cells and molecules of the immune system that create an immunological barricade to
infection. A critical component of the skin barrier are antimicrobial proteins- evolutionarily ancient immune
effectors that maintain mutually-beneficial host-microbial relationships at multiple epithelial surfaces, such
as the skin and the intestine. Recently, we discovered that proteins in the Resistin family (human Resistin
and mouse RELMα) are antimicrobial and expressed by keratinocytes and by sebaceous glands - the oil
producing glands of the skin. In addition to RELMα, there are innumerable proteins elaborated by
sebaceous glands with unknown biochemical function. Little is understood about the role that bacteria play
in regulating the expression of these proteins. We thus wanted to identify other genes expressed by the
sebaceous gland that might, 1) play a role in host defense and 2) modulate the skin microbiome. Using
whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), we compared the expression profile of sebocytes treated with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to sebocytes treated with a vehicle control. We were surprised to find that 4
members of the small proline rich family (gene name SPRR) were upregulated by LPS. SPRR proteins
also have structural features similar to other described antimicrobial proteins. Our preliminary data indicate
that SPRR1A and SPRR2A proteins can kill skin commensals in vitro. In this proposal we will utilize an
array of in vitro and in vivo techniques to: (Aim 1) determine whether SPRR1A can kill bacterial pathogens,
(Aim 2) delineate how SPRR1 proteins are secreted from skin, and (Aim 3) determine the physiologic
function of SPRR2A in skin. These studies will help us understand how the sebaceous gland contributes
to cutaneous host defense.
 My long-term career goal is to develop an independent research program that investigates host
defense at the skin surface. After completing MD/PhD and Dermatology training at Johns Hopkins, I was
recruited to UT Southwestern to train as a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of Lora Hooper, Ph.D, an
internationally recognized leader in mechanistic studies of the host/microbe interface and the
characterization of antimicrobial proteins in the gastrointestinal tract. During my tenure in the Hooper lab,
I have expanded the focus of the lab to include skin. This career develop award will support my final years
in this unique training environment and give me the opportunity to gain new skills in: 1) cellular trafficking
biochemistry and 2) bacterial genomics. I have created a mentorship team of scientists to help fill these
gaps in my training, Sandra Schmid Ph.D., Heidi Kong M.D., and Julia Segre Ph.D. Through the completion
of these aims, I will create a fully independent research platform, able to generate novel therapeutic
solutions for skin infections and inflammatory skin diseases."
10778189,"ABSTRACT / SUMMARY
 Acute critical illnesses rapidly lead to severe organ damage and loss of life. These illnesses include
sepsis, stroke, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we focus on ARDS, which is acute
inflammation of the lungs’ air sacs, and the cause of death in COVID-19. For ARDS and these other diseases,
we have developed ligand-targeted nanocarriers that localize drugs to the inflamed microvasculature of affected
organs. As we moved towards clinical translation, we found the key step is gaining control of complement, a set
of plasma proteins that bind microbes and aid their clearance. But we found complement-nanoparticle
interactions are a “double-edged sword”, with both benefits to optimize, and deleterious features to resolve.
 First, we found that complement protein C3 rapidly opsonizes particular nanoparticles, and that such C3-
opsonized nanoparticles then act as “decoys” to ameliorate ARDS mouse models (e.g., nebulized LPS) by ~75%.
The C3-coated nanoparticles accumulate in marginated leukocytes, which are key to ARDS pathophysiology,
and cause those cells to leave the lungs. However, C3 opsonization induces an anaphylaxis-like reaction called
CARPA (complement-activation-related pseudo-allergy). Therefore, in Aim 1, we will engineer nanoparticles
that can function like C3-coated decoys to ameliorate ARDS, but without CARPA. We will also investigate the
mechanism underlying nanoparticle decoy therapy. Then we will test the translational potential of these
optimized decoy nanoparticles by testing them in fresh, perfused, ex vivo human lungs.
 Second, we found that the ligand-targeted nanoparticles we have been developing for drug delivery for
years also induce CARPA. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will re-engineer our ligand-targeted nanoparticles to prevent
CARPA. We will test a drug carrier we have previously used to concentrate drugs in the alveolar
microvasculature of the lungs: liposomes conjugated to anti-PECAM antibodies that bind endothelial cells. We
will test in vitro and in vivo in mice whether various engineered versions of anti-PECAM liposomes can evade
C3 opsonization and CARPA, and thereby achieve more specific delivery to the lungs. Lastly, we will test these
CARPA-avoiding nanoparticles with plasma from ARDS patients, as such patients have perturbed complement.
 Upon completion of these two Aims, we will have developed two technologies that may aid therapy of
ARDS: 1) Decoy nanoparticles that safely cause marginated leukocytes to leave the lungs, and thereby
ameliorate ARDS-like phenotypes; 2) A technology for preventing complement side effects such as CARPA
when delivering ligand-targeted nanoparticles. As marginated leukocytes play pivotal roles in most acute critical
illnesses, and CARPA sensitivity is common to those as well, the technologies developed here may impact not
only ARDS, but also sepsis, stroke, and more."

Residents of sovereign, Indigenous Nations intrinsically hold deep connections to their land, culture, and
community, which positively affects Indigenous health and well-being. However, Indigenous health is
diminished by multi-level structural factors that manifest in numerous ways including indoor
environmental exposures; persistent fall injury hazards in the home needing repair/modification; and
limited access to culturally competent medical specialists. A team led by the federally-designated
Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Center (AASTEC), in partnership with the University
of New Mexico and University of Arizona, proposes a multi-part intervention to enhance the home
environment and Indigenous health. This novel program will incorporate community-based participatory
research principles with an approach that centers Indigenous methodologies to promote Indigenous health
across the societal, community, household and individual levels. A housing repair voucher program
(primary intervention) will be informed by home and participant assessments, and partnered with clinical
training and referral protocol development, tribal public health workforce development and capacity-
building, and a multi-sectoral Healthy Tribal Homes Coalition. Creating an adaptable framework that
centers upon community values to address simultaneously environmental exposures, fall injury risk, daily
stressors, and respiratory health (emphasizing asthma) will increase quality of life for participants, their
families, and community. This project will yield a template and set of best practices that other Indigenous
and non-Indigenous communities may adapt to address their health priorities in a manner centered upon
their values and identity."
10771948,"The psychosocial needs and risks of children with cancer and their families are well-documented in the
literature, including the increased risk of parental distress, posttraumatic stress, and anxiety. There is a critical
need to provide evidence-based psychosocial care to parents and caregivers of children with cancer (PCCC),
although many challenges exist regarding in-person intervention delivery. eHealth interventions represent an
exciting potential opportunity to address many of the barriers to in-person intervention delivery in this
population, but are not yet widely utilized in pediatric psychosocial cancer care. The COVID-19 pandemic has
further illuminated the need for flexible, acceptable, and accessible eHealth psychosocial interventions. The
Electronic Surviving Cancer Competently Intervention Program (eSCCIP) is an innovative eHealth intervention
for PCCC, delivered through a combination of self-guided interactive online content and telehealth follow-up
with a therapist. eSCCIP aims to decrease symptoms of acute distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress
while improving coping abilities by delivering evidence-based therapeutic content through a flexible, easily
accessible eHealth tool. The intervention is delivered to one or two PCCC per family, but content is designed to
apply to the whole family system. eSCCIP is grounded in principles of cognitive-behavioral and family systems
therapy and is adapted from two efficacious in-person interventions for caregivers of children with cancer, the
Surviving Cancer Competently Intervention Program (SCCIP) and the Surviving Cancer Competently
Intervention Program – Newly Diagnosed (SCCIP-ND). eSSCIP has been rigorously developed through a
stakeholder-engaged development process involving close collaboration with PCCC, content experts in
pediatric oncology and eHealth, and web design and development experts. A Spanish language adaptation of
eSCCIP, El Programa Electronico de Intervencion para Superar Cancer Competentemente (eSCCIP-SP), has
recently been developed following a rigorous process and is now ready for testing as well. The self-guided
online modules of eSCCIP/eSCCIP-SP feature a mix of didactic video content, novel multifamily video
discussion groups featuring parents of children with cancer, and hands-on interactive activities. Pilot testing is
currently underway with promising initial results. The objective of the proposed study is to test
eSCCIP/eSCCIP-SP in a rigorous, multisite RCT compared to an education control condition. The primary
study endpoint is a reduction in acute distress from baseline to post-intervention, with secondary endpoints
focused on reductions in symptoms of posttraumatic stress and anxiety ,and improvements in coping self-
efficacy and cognitive coping. Data will be collected at three timepoints (baseline, post-intervention, and three-
month follow-up). An additional, exploratory aim will be focused on implementation strategies and potential
costs and cost-savings of eSCCIP/eSCCIP-SP, laying the groundwork for future trials focused on
dissemination and implementation, stepped-care models, and intervention refinement."
10771949,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overall goal of this project is to improve the outcomes of injured patients with trauma-induced coagulopa-
thy (TIC), both by performing detailed investigation of the mechanisms underlying this disorder and by providing
a junior clinician-scientist the training required to continue this work as an independent researcher. Trauma is
the leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (a measure of overall disease burden), both in the United States
and worldwide. In trauma patients, hemorrhage is the leading cause of potentially preventable death. TIC is a
common complication of serious injury that impairs normal hemostasis and contributes to the burden of death
from hemorrhage. Two prominent features of TIC are impairment of platelet adhesion and aggregation function
and derangement of microvascular blood flow. The causes of these abnormalities are not known, but preliminary
data suggest several possible contributors. First, trauma patients have changes in their plasma von Willebrand
factor (VWF) profiles that suggest high levels of endothelial cell activation and VWF secretion. Second, trauma
patients have high levels of oxidative stress, which is known to make VWF hyperadhesive. Third, trauma patients
have low levels of gelsolin, a protein that normally solubilizes actin polymers, which can obstruct microvascular
blood flow and promote thrombus formation. Other disease states that involve similar pathways have associated
microthrombus formation leading to microvascular blood flow changes similar to those seen in TIC. Finally, three
key surface receptors that serve as mechanical anchors for platelets (GPIbα, αIIbβ3, and GPVI) show alterations
in number and structure. Together, this suggests that the VWF-platelet adhesion axis mechanistically contrib-
utes to platelet function impairment and microcirculation derangement through microvascular thrombosis and
platelet receptor cleavage or occupancy. This project includes a set of experiments to elucidate the underlying
causes of the platelet and microvascular changes of TIC. In Aim 1, the defects in the VWF-platelet adhesion
axis will be characterized by detailed study of the changes that occur with VWF, its primary cleaving protein
(ADAMTS13), and platelet adhesiveness in trauma patient blood samples. Aim 2 will characterize the alterations
of platelet receptors GPIbα, αIIbβ3, and GPVI seen in TIC by testing for receptor occupancy and for receptor
cleavage and loss in trauma patient samples. Aim 3 will evaluate the effects of agents that decrease VWF-
platelet adhesion and actin polymerization on microvascular blood flow and clinical outcomes using contrast-
enhanced ultrasound in a rat model of TIC. In addition to filling critical knowledge gaps in the pathophysiology
of TIC, this project will allow the PI to develop advanced research career skills. Under a multidisciplinary team
of expert mentors, the PI will gain a comprehensive conceptual and practical knowledge base in primary hemo-
stasis, learn how to apply a powerful ultrasound imaging tool in an animal model, and complete career advance-
ment activities to generate a unique expertise that will empower his future research. Ultimately, this project will
both advance our knowledge of TIC and catalyze a junior investigator's transition to independence."

Variants at ERAP1 modulate the risk for several forms of non-infectious uveitis in the presence of disease-
associated HLA class I, strongly suggesting a so far unproven change in immunodominance with impact on
disease causation and protection.
The overall objective of this application is to determine through which mechanism ERAP1 allotypes cause and
protect from HLA I-associated uveitis. Our long-term goal is to understand and therapeutically target HLA class
I associated autoimmunity in uveitis.
 Our central hypothesis is that allotypic ERAP1 alters the HLA I-bound peptidome to include epitopes that
are immunogenic when presented by disease-relevant HLA I, which induces or controls disease through a
change in immunodominance. The rationale for this study is that mechanistic understanding of ERAP1-mediated
pathogenesis in HLA I immunity will enable targeted therapy design aimed at specific ERAP1-HLA I-uveitis
subsets.
 Based on these considerations we will implement two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine through
which mechanism the allotype ERAP1 Hap10 initiates immune dysfunction in HLA-B*51+ Behçet’s uveitis (BU)
but protects from HLA-B*27+ acute anterior uveitis (AAU) via a series of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing
experiments. These experiments will allow us to define its functional contribution to the HLA I restricted
peptidomes relevant to each of these disorders and their effect on the generation of immunogenic or tolerogenic
immune responses. In Aim 2 we will establish how HLA I restricted pathogenic epitopes depend on allotype-
specific ERAP1 function through the exploitation of clonally expanded CD8 T cells from active BU and AAU
patients for cellular cloning, genome-editing and functional assessment of immunogenicity.
 We expect the following outcomes 1) knowledge of the immunogenic and tolerogenic effects mediated
by allotypic ERAP1 in two highly disease-relevant HLA restriction contexts: HLA-B27 and B51, 2) identity of
epitopes that induce or prevent immunogenicity in these contexts, 3) proof of principle that allotypic ERAP1
regulates autoimmunity and that manipulation of its activity modulates pathogenicity providing irrefutable
rationale for targeting ERAP1 enzyme activity pharmacologically, or through gene therapy. This will have a
positive impact on the field through the identification of molecular targets allowing the design of therapy for
patient groups defined by genotypes, and through mechanistic understanding extending beyond the scope of
BU and AAU to additional MHC-I-opathies with immense impact on human health, such as IBD, psoriasis, and
psoriatic arthritis."

Evidence-based weight management programs are effective when individuals are able to consistently adhere to
recommendations. However, a large proportion of treatment-seeking individuals do not experience clinically
significant weight loss. Innovative strategies are needed to optimize behavior change in weight management
interventions. The proposed randomized controlled trial tests two self-regulatory approaches to improve
intentional weight loss and diet quality in individuals with overweight or obesity: (1) an environmental control
strategy (AVOID) and (2) an impulse control training strategy (RESIST). Specifically, 500 women and men (BMI
between 25-39.9 kg/m2) will be recruited from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center network of hospitals and clinics.
All participants will be enrolled in a 12-month weight-management program (WW, formerly Weight Watchers©)
focusing on diet, physical activity and mindset skills, and randomized to one of four study arms: (1) WW only, (2)
WW + modification of home food environment and online grocery delivery (AVOID), (3) WW + gamified inhibitory
control training (RESIST), (4) WW + AVOID + RESIST. Baseline, 6- and 12-month assessments will be
completed by experienced, English and Spanish speaking study staff. Aim 1 (Outcomes). (a) Tests how AVOID
and RESIST affect weight loss and waist circumference (primary) and diet quality (secondary). H1a: AVOID
and/or RESIST (arms 2, 3, 4) will result in greater weight loss at 6-month and 12-month timepoints compared to
WW alone. (b) Tests potential ripple effects of AVOID and RESIST on available household members' diet quality
(primary) and weight (secondary). H1b: We predict that AVOID (arms 2 and 4) will produce greater dietary
changes in household members than WW alone and RESIST (arms 1 and 3). Aim 2 (Mechanisms). Tests the
mechanistic pathways of AVOID and RESIST by (a) comparing longitudinal changes in inhibitory control and
home food environment across study arms; and (b) whether inhibitory control and the home food environment
mediate the relationships between study arms and anthropometric and dietary outcomes. H2: AVOID will
produce changes in the home food environment and RESIST will operate on inhibitory control. Aim 3
(Moderators). Examines how (a) individual characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, household
composition, physical activity, baseline BMI and executive functioning), and (b) process data (frequency of
grocery delivery, dining out and take out, impulse control training and WW app use) moderate the relationship
between study arms and anthropometric and dietary outcomes. These considerations are important to help
explain heterogeneity in intervention outcomes and to understand who benefits from AVOID and/or RESIST."
10772052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The impact of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis on cancer biology is broad because the BCL-2
(B-cell CLL/Lymphoma 2) family regulates tumor initiation and maintenance, and is directly targeted by anti-
cancer therapies. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of BCL-2 family function will advance our knowledge
of the pathways that cause cancer, and are clinically targeted to cure cancer. The mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis proceeds when the BCL-2 family collaborates to compromise the outer mitochondrial membrane
(OMM). This process, referred to as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), allows for pro-
apoptotic factors within mitochondria to gain access to the cytoplasm, which leads to caspase activation and
rapid dismantling and removal of the targeted cell. BAX (BCL-2 associated X protein) is the major pro-apoptotic
BCL-2 protein that engages MOMP by creating proteolipid pores in the OMM. BAX-dependent MOMP inhibits
tumorigenesis, and on the flipside, BAX-dependent apoptosis is induced by a majority of conventional and
targeted chemotherapeutics. In order for BAX to gain pro-apoptotic function, it has two general requirements:
(1) BAX needs to interact with a subset of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family: the “direct activator” BH3-only
proteins, e.g., BID and BIM; and (2) BAX requires stable interactions with mitochondrial lipids to structurally
rearrange leading to BAX’s insertion, oligomerization, and pore formation. While decades of research have
focused on understanding the first requirement, little has been discovered on how mitochondrial environment
mechanistically contributes to MOMP. Over the years, my laboratory showed that mitochondrial environment
directly controls BAX function, and the mitochondrial-produced 16-carbon sphingolipid metabolite 2-trans-
hexadecenal (2-t-hex) is required for BAX activation and BAX-dependent apoptosis. By utilizing novel
mitochondrial model systems coupled with state-of-the-art biochemical, cellular, and structural techniques, we
are now ready to determine the mechanistic contributions of 2-t-hex within the BAX activation process, and
more broadly, to reveal how 2-t-hex binding defines functional classifications within the BCL-2 family.
Furthermore, we generated evidence that cancer cells specifically disrupt the cooperation between BAX and 2-
t-hex leading to apoptotic resistance – and identified ‘first-in-class’ small molecules to overcome this
phenotype. Our broad objectives are to build a foundation of novel mechanistic insights into the role of 2-t-hex
on BAX-dependent apoptosis and the BCL-2 family, and to use this information to develop novel therapeutic
strategies against cancer. These objectives will be accomplished in three complementary aims: (1) Define the
molecular mechanism of 2-t-hex mediated BAX activation; (2) Elucidate the molecular mechanism by which S-
nitrosylation of BAX promotes apoptotic resistance in cancer; and (3) Identify, refine, and characterize “first-in-
class” therapeutics that transform S-nitrosylated BAXCys62 from apoptosis-resistant to apoptosis-competent thus
promoting chemotherapeutic success."

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, families have experienced more than two decades of violence,
displacement and political instability resulting in extreme poverty with limited educational and economic
opportunities. Child poverty and exposure to trauma is widespread and particularly concentrated in conflict-
affected and rural areas. Childhood exposure to multiple adversities can lead to a lifetime of poor mental
health. In rural DRC, we found parent’s self-report of poor mental health and victimization or perpetration of
intimate partner violence (IPV) had a significant negative impact on their young adolescents’ mental health,
with different impacts for boys and girls. The underlying ideologies of male authority and women’s place being
in the home has led to gender norms that restrict opportunities with limited attention to effects on mental
health. The study provides a unique opportunity with a proven Congolese partner to examine the combined
and synergistic effects of two proven structural interventions; 1) Rabbits for Resilience (RFR), youth-led
economic empowerment program; and 2) Indashyikirwa (IK), a couples/parents-based gender equality
program on adolescent mental health. Using a clustered randomized controlled trial with three groups (RFR
only, IK only, RFR + IK), we examine the combined and synergistic effects of the interventions and the
pathways through which RFR and IK improves adolescent mental health. We will test two hypotheses: 1)
Adolescents in the RFR + IK and RFR only households will report greater improvement in mental health via
pathway of improved self-efficacy, school attendance, food security and peer relationships compared to
adolescents in IK only households; and 2) Adolescents in RFR + IK and IK only households will report greater
improvement in mental health via the pathway of improved parent relationship quality and power sharing,
reduced exposure to IPV, improved parental mental health and support of gender equitable norms compared
to adolescents in RFR only households. Differences in pathways of the intervention effect will be examine by
sex of adolescent. The significance cannot be underestimated given nearly 1 in 5 children live in conflict-
affected areas, worldwide - and are facing a lifetime of poor mental health with inequitable access to education
and economic opportunities."

The overarching goal of the current proposal is to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie figure-ground
segregation, an important component of natural scene interpretation, focusing on the role of the primary visual
cortex (V1) and its dynamic interactions with higher visual cortical areas. Specifically, we will measure how V1
responds to a wide range of backgrounds, including artificial and naturalistic textures, with and without
occluding targets, and develop computational encoding models that would allow one to predict V1 population
responses at multiple biologically-relevant spatial scales to arbitrary figures and backgrounds (Aim 1). In Aim 2
we will study the role of V1 in figure-ground discrimination by measuring and perturbing V1 population
responses while animals detect a camouflaged target that occludes a background of the same texture family.
These experiments will be used to distinguish between different candidate decoding models that describe how
single-trial V1 population responses lead to behavior in the task. An important goal would be to test whether V1
plays an active role in the segmentation computation. The alternative is that V1 provides the feedforward input
to a segmentation computation that occurs downstream, and receives top-down figure-ground signals only
after the segmentation had been completed. Overall, the proposed experiments will lead to a deeper
understanding of the role of V1 in fundamental mid-level visual computations and will serve as an important
step toward a quantitative understanding of the representation of complex natural scenes by populations of
neurons in V1."

Human vision begins in the retina where light capture stimulates an electrical signal within the outer
segment organelle of photoreceptor neurons. The outer segment is a modified primary cilium built with
hundreds of flattened membranous discs that maximize the light-absorbing surface. Phototoxicity
damages the disc membranes requiring that the outer segment be continuously renewed through the
addition of new discs at the base. Outer segment length is maintained by phagocytosis of old discs
from the distal tip by the adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells. The unique architecture of the outer
segment compartment is critical to photoreceptor health and mutations that disrupt disc stacks underly
many forms of human retinal degeneration. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate components
that contribute to forming and maintaining discs in order to better understand the pathogenesis of
inherited retinal degeneration.
 Rod photoreceptors express three proteins containing the glutamic acid rich protein (GARP)
domain: the β1-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNG), GARP1, and GARP2. In mice,
genetic ablation of all three GARP proteins results in extraneous membrane outgrowth from the outer
segment base, a hallmark of defects in disc synthesis. I have new preliminary data indicating that the
key disc morphogenesis protein, protocadherin 21 (PCDH21), is dysregulated in this model. These data
led to my hypothesis that GARP proteins help to recruit PCHD21 to the leading edge of the budding
nascent discs and the loss of GARP proteins results in reduced rates of disc growth that contributes to
retinal degeneration. I have further identified that the CNGβ1 subunit is necessary to stabilize PCDH21
at the outer segment base, making it the primary focus of Aim 1. I will confirm that loss of PCDH21 from
the outer segment base drives defects in disc morphogenesis and test whether CNGβ1 is sufficient to
regulate PCDH21 and disc formation.
 Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disc formation have revealed the urgent
need to quantitatively measure rates of disc synthesis, yet the tools to do so lack sensitivity and
versatility. As a solution, I developed an inducible mouse model that expresses a photoconvertible,
outer segment targeted, transmembrane reporter that I will use to quantify new disc addition. In Aim 2, I
will characterize this novel mouse model followed by a quantitative comparison of rates of disc growth
between wildtype, GARPKO, and CNGβ1-KO mouse rods to understand how dysregulated disc
formation contributes to retinal degeneration. Completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight
into the role GARP proteins play in disc formation and outer segment growth kinetics as well as provide
a quantitative tool for future investigation of disc renewal in health and disease."

To understand the critical factors that negatively impact gene therapy for hemophilia A, our program will
investigate the key problems associated with AAV vector production and design, factor VIII (FVIII) expression,
and role of the immune system. Proposed gene transfer studies critically rely on strict control of vector
composition and thorough characterization of vector properties before and after vector administration.
Unfortunately, in-depth characterization of vectors is stymied by the lack of knowledge of some of the critical
parameters of a given vector preparation that may be key to vector performance. This is exemplified by
challenges in analyzing the impurities within AAV vector products such as defective viral particles that closely
resemble the vector itself. The scientists of the proposed Molecular Virology Core (MVC) developed a series of
new assays on AAV vectors which provide additional critical parameters to be analyzed for safety of gene
therapy. This unprecedented depth of analysis will provide Projects 1, 2, and 3 with the knowledge of vector
composition that they require to interpret the outcomes of gene transfer experiments and help develop safer
vectors. The MVC will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) Manufacturing of quality vectors to support all
projects: For results between studies and projects to be comparable, identical standards of vector production
need to be applied. The proposed manufacturing process will further eliminate variables, e.g., use of plasmid
backbone-free production, among other innovations. In addition, MVC will aid Projects 1, 2 and 3 in vector
development, incorporating new discoveries and generating novel AAV vectors that improve hepatic FVIII gene
delivery. 2) Providing in-depth molecular characterization of AAV vectors for in vitro and in vivo studies:
MVC will provide single AAV genome analysis using a newly developed assay based on PacBio sequencing and
bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data. Traditional AAV vector assays such as AAV titering by ELISA,
Southern blot analysis, silver staining as well as digital PCR/qPCR will also be performed. 3) In-depth analysis
for AAV genome status post-delivery. AAV genomes status in vivo will be analyzed by next generation
sequencing as well as traditional Southern blot and qPCR. AAV transcriptome analysis will also be included."
10774198,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the wake of discouraging results from treatment trials in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the need to identify novel
approaches is urgent. There is emerging consensus that the lack of efficacy in AD clinical trials is attributable
to disease heterogeneity. Accordingly, identifying predictors of specific AD endophenotypes that could become
targets for intervention is of great interest. Among potential options, compelling evidence implicates the stress
response as a promising candidate. Indeed, findings from numerous studies converge on the notion that
individuals with a heightened sensitivity to stress are at greater risk of developing AD, suggesting that these
individuals may represent a group who could be targeted in AD treatment trials. Translating these findings into
clinical application has been hampered, however, by a lack of integration between studies that use rigorous
experimental interrogation of the endocrine stress response and studies that include sophisticated
characterization of patient samples. We aim to address this crucial gap. In this application, we propose to
conduct a prospective study to examine the associations among the endocrine stress response, the negative
cognitive effects of acute stress, and subsequent cognitive decline in 60 men and 60 women with mild
cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI). For our basic study design, we will induce acute stress with the Trier
Social Stress Test (TSST), and then measure the endocrine hormone and cognitive responses. The domains
of memory and executive functioning will be the primary cognitive outcomes. Salivary samples collected at
fixed intervals throughout the TSST will be used to measure stress hormone response; cortisol will be the
primary hormone outcome. We will also examine the influence of the APOE gene and polygenic risk scores for
AD and collect blood-based biomarkers associated with AD pathophysiology. Specific Aim #1: To determine
the association between endocrine response to acute stress and memory and executive test performance
following acute stress in individuals with MCI due to AD. Specific Aim #2: To examine the moderating effect of
APOE genotype and polygenic risk score on the association between endocrine response to acute stress and
cognitive test performance following acute stress in individuals with MCI due to AD. Specific Aim #3: To
determine predictors of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration at 2-year follow-up. Secondary Aim: Conduct
the analyses from Specific Aims 1-3 in men and women separately in order to identify sex-specific predictors
of stress-induced cognitive impairment and cognitive decline and neurodegeneration after 2 years.
Public health significance: Given the many recent failures of amyloid-lowering therapies in AD, it is important
to identify new potential treatment mechanisms. The proposed study could lay the groundwork for future AD
prevention trials targeting stress vulnerability and HPA-axis reactivity in at-risk individuals."
10910021,"Schizophrenia is a serious and debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects nearly 1% of the world's population.
Within the Veterans Health Administration, total costs in FY 2014 for Veterans with psychotic disorders (of
which schizophrenia is the most severe) was over 6 billion dollars. Deficits in cognition – both non-social and
social -- are core features of schizophrenia. The deficits in social cognition refer to the processes that are
involved in the perception, encoding, storage, retrieval and regulation of information about other people and
ourselves. The problems in social cognition underlie the social disability and reduced functioning of the illness.
A greater understanding of social cognitive impairments would provide opportunities for targeted recovery-
focused interventions. This proposal will address an unanswered question: specifically how and where in the
brain social processing goes awry in schizophrenia.
We know which social processing brain systems are relevant to understanding schizophrenia. However, we do
not know whether social processing impairments emerge within a particular brain system or between systems
when they work together (i.e., are integrated). Only some systems are impaired in schizophrenia. For
example, mentalizing, which involves taking others' viewpoints, is clearly impaired in schizophrenia. Affect
sharing, which is the automatic activation of emotion in ourselves when we see emotional displays in others, is
relatively intact. Empathy (i.e. sharing, understanding, and responding to emotional experiences of another
person) is a high-level social processing ability that requires integration among processing systems, including
affect sharing and mentalizing. Our knowledge of the neural basis of social processing impairments and social
disability in schizophrenia is severely lacking, and the goal of this proposal is to address this knowledge gap.
The study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine regional brain activity, seed-
based connectivity, and brain network organization in 72 Veterans with schizophrenia and 72 group-matched
controls. Clinical assessments and performance-based tasks in social cognition will also be included. The
aims will be addressed using three social processing paradigms: 1) A Pain Rating Task in which participants
view painful and non-painful images. It activates the affect sharing system. 2) A Director's Task in which
participants take the same or different viewing perspective as another person. It activates the mentalizing
system. And 3) An Empathic Accuracy Task in which participants monitor the mood of a social “target” on a
video. It relies on multiple social processing systems, including affect sharing and mentalizing.
A close evaluation of activation, connectivity, and brain network organization in social processing brain
systems will identify specific points of neural vulnerability in schizophrenia. In that way, we can begin to
understand how specific disruptions in neural processes lead to impaired social functioning."
10784602,"Epilepsy and Autism spectrum disorder are among the most common neurological disorders that affect
children, and there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is
involved in the development of both disorders. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an ideal model in which
to study the effects of abnormal mTOR signaling in the brain because dysregulation of this pathway has been
implicated in the neurological symptoms of both animal models and patients. Although the TSC-mTOR
signaling pathway has been well studied, the downstream effect of dysregulation of this pathway on neurons is
not completely understood. We have found that loss of Tsc2 in an animal model of TSC leads to down-
regulation of the critical transcription factor, Egr1, in certain sub-types of pyramidal neurons. In addition, we
have observed down-regulation of EGR1 in cortical neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from patients with TSC, coincident with increased activity in these neurons. We hypothesize that
down-regulation of EGR1 occurs due to dysregulation of mTOR in two separate signaling complexes and
contributes to neuronal abnormalities observed in TSC, such excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. To demonstrate
the clinical relevance of this finding, we propose to confirm our observation in iPSC-derived neurons from
patients with TSC and cortical tubers from individuals with TSC. We will then examine the mechanism by which
loss of TSC2 alters EGR1 expression in iPSC-derived neurons. Finally, we will examine excitability in iPSC-
derived neurons and determine the effect of rescuing EGR1 expression on this phenotype using extracellular
recordings.
The candidate is currently a Neurogenetics fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, and this proposal builds upon
his skills in bioinformatics and extends his skillset to the use of iPSC-derived neurons to model genetic disease,
molecular and cellular techniques to study dysregulated signaling pathways, single cell sequencing, and basic
electrophysiological concepts and techniques. His proposal includes a comprehensive mentoring and didactic
plan that will allow him to successfully learn new skills and gain expertise in each of these important areas. His
primary mentor, Dr. Mustafa Sahin, is a translational neuroscientist and expert in both the clinical research and
molecular biology of TSC. In addition, the candidate has assembled a K08 advisory committee consisting of Dr.
Lee Rubin, Dr. Elizabeth Engle, and Dr. Alexander Rotenberg, who each have specific expertise in various
aspects of this proposal, such as differentiation and study of iPSC-derived neurons, single cell sequencing,
and electrophysiology. The candidate is committed to a career in translation research focusing on neurogenetic

10784603,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Why do males and females behave differently in response to the same sensory cues? Behavioral sex-
specificity is most evident in the displays of social behaviors by males and females in response to identical
social cues. According to classical models of brain sex differentiation, molecular and architectural differences
in brain circuitry are responsible for mediating sex differences in behavior. Alternatively, male and female
brains may share a central circuit that is modulated differently. Strong support for this second model emerged
from studies of Trpc2 knockout mice in which vomeronasal sensing is impaired, and from recent observations
in various animal species including humans. In turn, these data raise the question - how does the brain
generate behavior sex specificity? Moreover, little is known about how changes in circulating hormones and
neural activity during puberty activate dormant neural circuits for sex specific behaviors – a process likely to be
associated with coordinated changes in synaptic strength and gene expression. I am developing a powerful
new tool for studying in situ gene expression dynamics in genetically defined neural circuits. I will use this
approach and test the hypothesis that gene expression programs during puberty act on similar circuits in males
and females to determine the sex specificity of social behaviors. In preliminary experiments, I have genetically
identified a subset of neurons in the mouse hypothalamus that gate behavioral sex-specificity. In the research
proposed here, I will investigate the development and function of this neural circuit associated with behavioral
sex-specificity by fulfilling the following aims: In Aim 1, I will establish the role of genetically identified neurons
in the hypothalamus in gating behavioral sex-specificity using cre-dependent viral tools for cell ablation. Next, I
will use a novel tool for cell type specific gene expression analysis to examine the molecular changes in these
neurons over puberty. In Aim 2, I will use cre-dependent viral tools to trace the monosynaptic inputs and
outputs of these neurons. Finally, in Aim 3, I will use whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology combined with
optogenetics and gene expression analysis to examine input specific synaptic and molecular changes in these
neurons that accompany the transition through puberty.
The training phase of the award, conducted in the laboratories of Dr. Catherine Dulac and Dr. Venkatesh
Murthy at Harvard University, outlines a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of technical and professional
skills that will enable my transition to an independent research position. The successful completion of this
project will provide a platform for future experiments aimed at understanding the development and architecture
of neural circuits underlying social behaviors."
10784604,"Despite decades of investigation, the biochemical pathways involved in regulation of fuel-stimulated insulin
secretion are incompletely resolved. This proposal seeks to gain a better understanding of how metabolic,
paracrine, and hormonal signaling mechanisms are integrated to regulate insulin secretion from islet ?-cells,
and how these pathways are altered when islets fail in diabetes. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)
involves both a “triggering” pathway driven by a KATP channel-dependent mechanism and an “amplifying” phase
that is largely KATP channel-independent. Our group has identified several novel pathways contributing to
amplification of GSIS: 1) Insulin secretion is activated by mitochondrial metabolism of anaplerotic substrates to
generate citrate and isocitrate, their egress from the mitochondria, and their engagement with the cytosolic,
NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1). NADPH produced in the IDH1 reaction is used to drive
sequential reduction of glutathione (GSH), glutaredoxin (GRX), and sentrin/SUMO-specific protease-1 (SENP-
1), which removes SUMO peptides from secretory granule-associated proteins to potentiate insulin granule
exocytosis. More recently, we have discovered that glucose stimulation induces reductive, “counter-clockwise”
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux to replenish cytosolic isocitrate for the IDH1 reaction. Molecular or
pharmacologic suppression of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), which catalyzes NADPH-dependent
reductive conversion of 2-ketoglutarate to isocitrate in the mitochondria, results in impairment of reductive TCA
cycle flux, lowering of NADPH levels, and inhibition of insulin secretion. In patch clamped ?-cells from human
subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) NAPDH, isocitrate, and GSH rescue insulin granule exocytosis in glucose-
unresponsive ?-cells; 2) Collaboration between the Newgard and Campbell laboratories has revealed that in
addition to its potent effect on insulin secretion, pharmacologic suppression of IDH2 alters glucagon secretion.
Mice with knockout of proglucagon-derived peptide production in ?-cells have impaired insulin secretion
responses to glucose and amino acids, suggesting that alteration of ?-cell function in response to IDH2 inhibition
could contribute to regulation of insulin secretion; 3) Very recently, we have found that inhibition of IDH2 not
only impairs GSIS, but also suppresses insulin secretion in response to glucose + the GLP-1 analog exendin-
4. Based on these findings, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1) To define the biochemical pathway
by which stimulatory glucose activates the IDH2/IDH1 metabolic cycle; Aim 2) To define the role of the
IDH2/IDH1 pathway in paracrine ?- to ?-cell and incretin regulation of insulin secretion; Aim 3) To investigate
signaling by the IDH2/IDH1 pathway in normal human islets, and in islets from humans and rodents with T2D.
Taken together, studies described in this project have strong potential to define targets for restoration of ?-cell
function in T2D, thus contributing to solutions for a national and global health care crisis."
10784605,"Candidemias represent the 4th most common type of bloodstream infection and with only three
commonly used antifungal drugs available, treatment options are threatened by drug resistance.
Infections linked to Candida glabrata represent the second most common type of candidemia and have
been increasing since the early 2000s. C. glabrata exhibits a robust ability to acquire resistance to azole
drugs, the most commonly used class of antifungal compounds. Isolates that are azole resistant are
routinely found to contain gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the PDR1 gene, encoding a transcription
factor that is a central regulator of drug resistance. These GOF forms of Pdr1 drive constitutively high
levels of transcription of target genes. Central among these is the ATP-binding cassette transporter-
encoding CDR1 locus. Cdr1 is a drug efflux pump that prevents the accumulation of toxic azole levels in
the cell. The target of azole drugs is the lanosterol -14 demethylase enzyme encoded by the ERG11
gene. ERG11 transcription is induced by azole drug challenge through the action of the Upc2A
transcription factor. The transcriptional regulatory circuits defined by Pdr1 and Upc2A have previously
been treated as separate pathways to azole resistance. We recently discovered that Upc2A controls
transcription of both PDR1 and CDR1, indicating the presence of a physiological tie between these
regulatory networks. In this proposal, we plan on dissecting the mechanism(s) used by Pdr1 to activate
gene expression and dissect the interaction between Pdr1 and Upc2A at the levels of target gene DNA-
binding and transcription. In aim 1, we will determine the functional contribution made by coactivator
proteins that we have found by mass spectrometry to co-purify with Pdr1. Epitope-tagging and gene
disruption alleles will allow determination of how these proteins interact with and modulate the ability of
Pdr1 to regulate gene expression. Aim 2 will identify protein targets interacting with the Pdr1 C-terminal
transcriptional activation domain that are responsible for recruitment of the transcriptional Mediator
complex and induction of gene expression. We will also use cross-linking approaches to identify proteins
that interact with this domain as well as potential negative regulatory domains within Pdr1. Finally, we
will use a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing and
RNA-sequencing to determine the mutual impact Pdr1 and Upc2A have on co-regulated genes. We will
also disrupt other transcription factor genes regulated by these two factors to identify the larger suite of
genes involved in the transcriptional response to azole drug challenge. Our finding of the connections
between Pdr1 and Upc2A indicates that these factors cooperate to confer azole resistance as part of
their normal function. Understanding of the molecular basis of this cooperation will provide insight into
new vulnerabilities to use to attenuate drug resistance."
10766206,"The overall objective of this research is to understand the role of sensory prediction in the auditory
cortex. The ability to predict the sensory consequences of one’s actions plays an important role in shaping
sensory coding and guiding behavior. In the auditory system, this prediction is used during vocal production,
allowing us to monitor feedback of the sound of our voice. However, the neural mechanisms of this auditory
self-monitoring are unknown. This proposal focuses on determining the mechanisms and neural circuits by
which sensory prediction changes sensory coding in the auditory cortex during vocalization, and the behavioral
role played by such predictions. We approach this using a novel vocal primate model, the marmoset monkey.
 Aim 1 focuses on the mechanisms of feedback encoding during vocalization, and tests the hypothesis
that sensory prediction shapes auditory cortex responses to calculate an error signal between vocal feedback
and the prediction. We record auditory cortex neurons in vocalizing marmosets while adjusting the frequency
content of their vocal feedback using frequency shifts of varying direction and magnitude to measure sensitivity
to feedback errors. To further investigate potential computational mechanisms by which sensory prediction
shapes feedback coding, we measure frequency tuning changes in auditory cortex during vocalization
compared to passive listening, and how these relate to predicted vocal acoustics.
 Aim 2 investigates the auditory cortical circuits involved in sensory prediction and feedback encoding,
testing the hypothesis that the dorsal auditory pathway exhibits greater feedback sensitivity than early auditory
cortex. We record responses to altered feedback during vocalization and compare responses between the
dorsal “where and how” pathway with primary auditory cortex (A1) and the ventral “what” pathway. We further
compare the strength of neural activity in predicting compensatory vocal changes during altered feedback.
These results have important implications for validating current models of functional specializations within
these higher-order auditory pathways.
 Aim 3 addresses the behavioral role of sensory prediction in auditory cortex, testing the hypothesis that
activity within the auditory cortex is necessary for feedback-dependent vocal control. We combine frequency-
shifted vocal feedback with pharmacologic inactivation of auditory cortex to determine if such manipulations
disrupt behavioral compensation. We further compare effects of inactivation between hemispheres and sites of
different frequency tuning. These experiments will demonstrate a causal role for the auditory cortex in
feedback self-monitoring and resulting vocal control."
10909295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic conditions, such as obesity, asthma, depression, and developmental disabilities, are increasing among
children worldwide. Further, the age at diagnosis for many such conditions is decreasing, pointing to early-life
origins. The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) paradigm posits that exposures and
experiences in utero and during early life influence phenotype and physiology as well as behaviors that shape
lifelong health. Epidemiologic studies of DOHaD phenomena have historically focused on single exposure-health
outcome associations, despite calls for more holistic approaches to capture the totality of exposures and their
causal pathways. Other important limitations of prior work include homogenous study samples that diminish
generalizability and limit opportunities to identify disparities and infrequent or lack of granularity in assessment
of exposures and health outcomes across ontogeny. Together, these limitations hamper identification of when
and how risk factors and combinations of risk factors across early life culminate in chronic disease. This proposal
addresses the above gaps by leveraging the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO)
Program to investigate a broad range of early-life exposures, from society to biology, in relation to pediatric
health outcomes among ~50,000 caregiver-offspring pairs. The Colorado team will implement ECHO’s Core and
Specialized Protocols in the Healthy Start Study, a Colorado pre-birth cohort that recruited and followed 1,250
mother-child dyads. In this cohort, exposures, and outcomes relevant to ECHO were collected during pregnancy,
at birth, during infancy and the toddler years, and in early childhood (4-5 years). In the first ECHO Cycle, the
Colorado team followed 765 children, to date, through middle childhood (8-12 years) and transferred extant data
from pregnancy onward to the ECHO platform. In response to RFA-OD-22-019 and in collaboration with other
ECHO components, our team will implement the ECHO Cohort Data and Biospecimen Collection Protocol with
high fidelity and use community-engaged retention strategies to follow 900 diverse participants aged 11-19 years
to achieve two scientific objectives: (1) characterize patterns of structural, chemical, and physical exposures
during the in utero period and early childhood that predict co-occurring clusters of major ECHO outcomes through
adolescence; and (2) examine joint effects of exposure to in utero overnutrition and childhood psychosocial
adversity on the Specialized Outcome of pediatric obesity. The work proposed will facilitate a holistic
understanding of how the totality of early-life exposures and experiences shape chronic disease risk in children;
examine the involvement of a potentially modifiable biological mechanism (DNA methylation); and provide
insights into multi-level targets for preventive action, including family- and individual-level factors that build
resiliency in the face of unfavorable early exposures. The Colorado team brings to ECHO a diverse group of
investigators who are uniquely poised to lead innovative team science to steer solution-oriented research."
10928230,"Summary
The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate of all industrialized nations, a trend that has been steadily
increasing for two decades. Nearly 2 in 3 maternal deaths are preventable, with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
being the leading cause. Preeclampsia (PE) and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major
sources of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Notably, half of pregnancy-associated maternal deaths
occur in the year after delivery. Although maternal morbidity is increasing across all racial and ethnic groups,
Black, Hispanic, and Native American women are disproportionately affected. We, and others, have
demonstrated a strong association between PE/HDP and postpartum CVD, but it remains unclear whether these
links stem from an underlying genetic, environmental, and physiologic state that precedes pregnancy or is a
direct effect of PE/HDP. The heterogeneity and complexity of PE/HDP demands an approach that intentionally
studies a range of clinical phenotypes, and integrates phenotypic, environmental exposure (EE), and multi-omic
data using computational modeling and machine learning to build multi-component signatures of the different
PE/HDP subtypes and unravel their relationships with maternal health outcomes, ultimately allowing us to
develop a precision approach to optimize postpartum maternal health.
The central goal of the Multi-Omics for Maternal Health after PE (MOM-Health) Disease Study Site is to use
multi-omic analyses of biofluids and placental tissue linked with comprehensive phenotypic and EE measures in
a diverse population to uncover mechanisms leading from PE/HDP to intervenable postpartum maternal health
outcomes. We will recruit 680 participants (180 high-risk and 500 low-risk) in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy and
follow them through pregnancy with serial collections of phenotypic and EE data and maternal biosamples,
yielding 200 cases with PE/HDP and 480 controls. At delivery, placental tissue and cord blood samples will be
collected from all 680 participants. All 200 cases and a subset of 100 controls will be followed for one year
postpartum, with collection of serial phenotypic (including functional CV testing) and EE measurements and
maternal biosamples. We anticipate collaborating closely with the OPCs that will be generating multi-omic data
from the collected biosamples, as well as the DACC, on integrated analysis and interpretation of the multi-omic,
phenotypic, and EE data. Our sites are led by investigators with extensive experience in recruitment and retention
of diverse populations through novel community-engagement resources, as well as experience in NIH consortia
using omic data for disease subtyping and biobanking of diverse biosamples. In addition, we will leverage
ongoing NIH-funded efforts in our group in which placental single cell/single nucleus and spatial transcriptomics
is being performed to prioritize circulating targets in the current study. This project has the potential to inform
methods to integrate longitudinal multi-component and multi-omic data and contribute to improved mechanistic
understanding of PE/HDP and risk stratification of women with PE/HDP."

The long-term objective of the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) initiative is to rapidly and efficiently translate advances in neuroscience into treatments for neurological disorders. There are over 1000 different neurological disorders, many of which are associated with significant cognitive and physical disabilities. In the United States, neurological diseases affect over 100 million people of all ages, and they are a significant cause of mortality and disability. While therapeutic options are currently limited or non-existent for many of these disorders, recent exciting advances in the neurosciences and in gene therapies for neurological disorders make it imperative to increase the ability to efficiently perform clinical trials. A central goal of NeuroNEXT is to facilitate, from initial conception through final analysis, high-quality early phase clinical trials and biomarker studies with clear go/no-go decisions in adult and pediatric neurological disorders. This application requests funds for the University of Iowa to continue serving as the DCC for NeuroNEXT. The DCC will continue to support study design, data collection, data management, data sharing, project management, clinical site monitoring, quality management, safety monitoring, and all statistical aspects of trials conducted within the network. The DCC will continue to build on our robust, standardized, and accessible infrastructure in a manner that is explicitly designed to accommodate dynamically changing requirements that naturally occur in clinical trials, and will continue to help NeuroNEXT succeed in providing more rapid evaluations of promising treatments in the neurosciences. Specific Aim 1 is to work closely with the CCC to continue to support a collaborative network community that efficiently solicits and conducts high-quality clinical trials for neurological disorders. Specific Aim 2 is to continue to provide high-quality IT/development, data management, statistical, and protocol coordination support for all network clinical trials. Specific Aim 3 is to expand the pool of experienced clinical Investigators, research staff, and biostatisticians who are prepared to be leaders of multicenter clinical research trials."
10907811,"Beginning in fall, 2016, the UC Davis pediatric cohort, ReCHARGE, was funded with the new
Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Consortium that encompassed
close to 80 sites. Now in year 7 of ECHO Phase 1, UC Davis has enrolled ~900 children into
ECHO from three neurodevelopmental groups of children with: autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
developmental delays (DD) without autistic symptoms, and typical development (TD); uploaded
over 55,000 data collection forms to the ECHO Cohort Data Platform, and transferred over 8000
biospecimen aliquots to the ECHO Biorepository, including DNA for SNP arrays, urine for
analyzing novel chemicals from common but understudied household products, and blood for
multiple uses. The UC Davis ECHO team led a number of analysis proposals, authored/co-
authored 40 peer-reviewed papers, with another 50 in-progress. The Team also contributed to
developing ECHO policies and participated in and led various working groups, such as
Neurodevelopment, Chemical Exposures, Epigenetics, as well as Committees on Publications,
Policy Implementation and Evaluation, and others. The ECHO-ReCHARGE cohort focuses on
the ECHO area of neurodevelopment, which is facilitated by the UC Davis MIND Institute. In
ECHO Phase 2, the UCD Aim 1 will: examine environmental, social, and biologic exposures in
associations with externalizing and internalizing behaviors, namely, symptoms of ADHD, anxiety
and depression at ages 8-20; and identify both synergistic relationships between environmental
and social factors, especially environmental justice and social justice, and potential modification
of exposure-outcome associations by early childhood developmental diagnosis (ASD, DD, TD),
age, sex and puberty status. Aim 2 will evaluate the same exposures, plus measures of PFAS
and plasticizers for associations with longitudinal trajectories of the above behavioral and
emotional outcomes, as well as cognitive skills. In both aims: environmental exposures include
air pollution, greenspace, and home product use; social factors are neighborhood SES, family
financial hardship, race, ethnicity, and parental mental health or substance use problems.
Aim 3 will implement the final ECHO protocol with high fidelity, maximize retention, and adhere
to all ECHO policies, IRB, HIPAA and other regulations. UCD will continue to contribute broadly
to the ECHO infrastructure; advance the science through analysis and publications; promote
diversity and equity through our research questions, workforce, and retention strategies; and
actively participate & play leadership roles in this high-profile, unique program to discover
underlying risk and resilience factors for childhood health and development."
10799683,"The long-term objective of this Pathway to Independence Award is two-fold: (1) support candidate Dr. Blayney
in building an independent research program and (2) facilitate her transition from postdoctoral fellow to
independent faculty researcher. To date, Dr. Blayney's research has focused on the risks for and
consequences of sexual victimization in young adults, including the social and sexual contexts associated with
sexual victimization risk. As part of postdoctoral training, Dr. Blayney's work has begun to examine the
proximal influence of alcohol in sexual risk patterns for young women with and without sexual victimization
histories. Dr. Blayney seeks to expand her training from basic alcohol research to developing and testing brief,
technology-based interventions to reduce alcohol and sexual risk. This long-term objective will be achieved
through a five-year training plan involving a carefully selected mentor team as well as targeted coursework
(e.g., classes, seminars, workshops) and hands-on training experiences. The goal of the proposed research is
to develop and test a specialized web-based intervention to reduce alcohol-related sexual risk behaviors
among young women with sexual victimization histories, a high-risk and underserved group. During the
mentored phase (K99), the intervention will be developed with user centered design (Aim 1), an innovative
approach from the technology sector that incorporates the target population into all stages of development. In
Aim 1a, intervention content will be drafted and presented to the target population (i.e., young women with
sexual victimization histories) for user feedback. In Aim 1b, intervention design will be evaluated using rapid
prototyping for user feedback before the intervention is programed. Once programed, Aim 1c will involve
usability testing of intervention delivery with the target population. Following intervention development, Aim 2
will assess intervention feasibility and acceptability with a web-based open trial. During the independent phase
(R00), a web-based RCT will be conducted to test intervention efficacy (Aim 3a), mechanisms of change (Aim
3b), and potential moderators (Aim 3c). Findings will serve as pilot data for an NIAAA R01 submission during
the R00 phase. The training plan for this application will focus on intervention development and testing,
innovative methods to enhance technology-based intervention development, and advanced statistics. Mentors
(Drs. George, Bedard-Gilligan, Cue Davis, Rhew) and consultants (Drs. Billings, Widman) are committed to the
candidate's training and each will provide unique expertise to the research and training plan. Support from this
award will be essential to the candidate's development as an independent scientist who can contribute to
alcohol research by developing and testing technology-based interventions to reduce alcohol and sexual risk.
The University of Washington is well suited to provide a stellar training experience and will promote NIH's
mission to develop early investigators who can be competitive for long-term research funding."

DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology has revolutionized the discovery of protein-
binding small molecules. We have developed a novel variant of this technology in which
the libraries are synthesized on tiny, hydrophilic beads using solid-phase synthesis
techniques and screened by incubation with fluorescently labeled, soluble proteins. This
platform will be employed to discover a plethora of new ligands for the proteasome and
other proteins involved in the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). They will serve as
probe molecules and drug leads for manipulating the UPS, which is critical for
maintaining protein homeostasis. An additional outcome of this work will be the
development of a new class of degraders that delivers a target protein directly to the
proteasome without the requirement for target Ubiquitylation. Finally, a nascent system
that allows screening DELs in cell-based assays will be optimized and utilized to discover
proteasome activators that can be used to test models of UPS dysfunction as a root cause
of aging and various degenerative diseases."
10806208,"Project Summary
Our overarching goal is to study the unique and interactive effects of adolescent experiences with SRD on
interactions with the criminal legal system, mental health substance use, and treatment-seeking in adulthood.
We will also assess the buffering effects of hypothesized community resilience factors that may be leveraged
to combat the effects of SRD. We will extend The Contexts Study, a large (n=6982), seven-wave panel study
of public-school children in three racially diverse (37% Black; 50% White), predominantly rural counties in
North Carolina. At wave one, collected in 2002, all 6th, 7th, and 8th graders attending a public school in the
three counties were eligible; the final wave occurred when participants were in 10th-12th grade. Context
includes extensive panel data on peer networks and comprehensive residential geocodes for participants.
Today, participants are in their early 30s. We propose to collect one additional wave of survey data and
augment existing data with administrative records. With data on adult outcomes, we will be uniquely positioned
to understand and combat SRD and its negative effects on developmental trajectories from adolescence to
adulthood. We will draw from a variety of data sources to construct innovative, multi-dimensional measures of
SRD, capturing adolescent SRD exposure within schools, peer networks, and neighborhoods. To achieve this,
measures will draw from adolescent peer network characteristics, students’ school records, public criminal
records, the Census, county tax-value property assessments, Google Maps, the American Community Survey,
and adolescent and adult surveys. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Measure effects of SRD exposure on
adolescent trajectories of mental health, substance use, and suspension or expulsion. SRD exposures include:
racially segregated peer networks and neighborhoods, racially disproportionate disciplinary actions,
neighborhood disadvantage, racially biased housing values and disproportionate penetration by predatory
lenders. We hypothesize that cumulative and lagged SRD exposure during adolescence results in worse
outcomes for Black but not White adolescents, and that Black individuals experiencing greater levels of SRD
will have worse outcomes than Black individuals with fewer exposures. Aim 2. a) Measure the degree to which
adolescent exposure to SRD explains mental health and treatment-seeking, substance use, and criminal legal
system involvement in adulthood; b) Use mediation analysis to determine the extent to which SRD exposure
during adulthood accounts for the effects of adolescent SRD on adult outcomes. We hypothesize that there will
be unique effects of adolescent SRD exposure that are not fully explained by SRD exposure during emerging
adulthood. Aim 3. Determine the extent to which the effects of adolescent SRD exposure on adult outcomes
are moderated by community resilience factors (operationalized as residential stability, voluntary service
organizations, mobilization, and collective efficacy). We hypothesize that effects of SRD exposure will be
partially buffered by high community resilience during adolescence or adulthood."
10757930,"Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal childhood epilepsy and a non-classical glycogen storage disorder with no
treatment or cure. Over the last 15 years, we and others have defined the molecular underpinnings of LD that
position the field to cure this horrific disease. A hallmark of LD is cytosolic aberrant glycogen-like inclusions
known as Lafora bodies (LBs) that accumulate in cells of most tissues, including the brain. Like patients, LD
mouse models present with LBs and neurodegeneration. Reduced glycogen synthesis via genetic methods
eliminates LB formation and rescues the neurological phenotype in LD mouse models. Thus, a current focus
in the field is to decrease LBs with the goal of treating LD.
 Valerion Therapeutics has engineered a cell delivery platform utilizing antibody fragments allowing their
antibody-enzyme fusions (AEFs) to deliver a protein into a myriad of cells. In collaboration with Valerion, we
recently identified therapeutic strategies to clear LBs. This involves use of a novel targeting functionality
fused to active LB-degrading amylases, called VAL-0417 and VAL-1221. We have completed in vitro proof of
concept experiments and found that VAL-0417 and VAL-1221 degrade LBs. Further, in situ experiments
demonstrate that they penetrate cells and they are active in cells. Strikingly, we see that
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of VAL-0417 and VAL-1221 efficiently degrade LBs in LD mouse
models, lowering total glucan levels of LD mouse brains to near WT levels.
 Pompe disease is a classical glycogen storage disease caused by lack of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-
glucosidase (GAA) that normally degrades glycogen. Valerion has completed pre-clinical studies with VAL-
1221 and initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. This trail involves IV administration of VAL-1221. However, the
current VAL-1221 formulation is not suitable for human ICV injections. Therefore, this proposal will:
Specific Aims for the R61 phase of the grant (1 year)
Specific Aim 1 – Reformulate VAL-1221 for ICV delivery. A series of go/no-go studies will be performed to
optimize the activity and stability of VAL-1221. We will also determine the brain biodistribution,
pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of ICV VAL-1221.
Specific Aims for the R33 phase of the grant (2 years)
Specific Aim 2 – Establish the optimal in vivo dosing strategy for ICV VAL-1221. We will perform a dose
escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ICV VAL-1221, along with studies that will
assess the duration and frequency of ICV VAL-1221 administration that most efficaciously improves glucan
clearance from the brains of Laforin knockout mice that have extensive pathological load, i.e. LBs.
 We are poised to perform the preclinical research required to translate this therapy into the clinic.
Additionally, VAL-1221 is a novel approach with potential beyond LD."
10757932,"Abstract
Regenerative medicine therapies of various kinds are promising and rapidly growing, both in scale and type.
The therapeutic products are not pills–they are living cells that are harvested from a patient (or sometimes a cell
bank) and are shipped to a pharmaceutical company that modiﬁes the cells and then sends them back to be re-
injected into the patient. Logistics plays an outsize role in this process because the samples need to be
maintained at ultra-low temperatures throughout the shipping process. Because these samples are personalized
to a particular patient, they are not replaceable with something else. If damaged or switched, the outcome will
be dire.
The state-of-the-art shipment technology today is, a dry shipper at liquid nitrogen temperature with a
temperature logger that is physically attached to the dry shipper–but they report the temperature of the shipper,
not the sample so if a sample is removed for inspection, this will not be recorded.
For regenerative medicine therapies to be successful, it is essential that the end-to-end processes of freezing,
storage, and thawing are carried out in strict adherence to precisely deﬁned protocols. Transient warming events
and variability in product temperatures throughout shipping and distribution can negatively affect the samples
and contribute to poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to validate optimized cold chain practices
individually for each sample, to ensure the highest quality therapeutic outcomes.
The goal of this fast-track proposal is to develop a functional pilot product that will provide an on-the-sample,
end to end temperature log before, during, and after shipping. Software will compare user-deﬁned protocol
criteria with the sample temperature record and will provide a go / no-go decision for use of the sample.
The speciﬁc aims of the project are: (a) develop the on-sample electronics that records the temperature history
of the sample along with timestamps with an accuracy of 2 °C, (b) develop the shipper electronics that needs to
operate for 3 days on batteries and record time stamped sample temperatures and transmits that data back to the
sample custodian, and (c) develop a cryogenic container that can keep the sample data acquisition active while
the samples moving around in the lab, and ﬁnally (d) a quality assurance station the can inform the end user if
the sample is viable by checking the sample's temperature record against the criteria set by the protocols for that
sample."
10757933,"ABSTRACT
Despite substantial experimental evidence for the important functional role of myeloid-biased HSC (myHSC) in
stress, inflammation and aging, the mechanisms which control myHSC quiescence and self-renewal are not
known. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how myHSC self-renewal can be regulated by the
bone marrow microenvironment in order to identify novel signaling pathways that can be activated to enhance
hematopoietic regeneration, and blocked if they become dysregulated in myeloid malignancy. The overall
objective in this application is to understand at the mechanistic level how Sema4a, a newly-defined niche
factor, selectively promotes quiescence and self-renewal of myHSC, and to test potential therapeutic utility of
its pro-regenerative effect in clinically relevant models of proliferative stress and HSC exhaustion. The central
hypothesis is that Sema4a is released from osteoprogentiors and endothelial cells in the bone marrow
microenvironment and binds to Plexin D1 on myHSC, which triggers a cascade of inhibitory signals that shield
myHSC from exhaustion, premature differentiation and DNA damage. The rationale for this project is that
identification of Sema4a-induced myHSC-specific pathways and testing their protective effect on myHSC in
pre-clinical models of proliferative stress is likely to offer a strong scientific framework for future therapeutic
strategies to improve myHSC self-renewal and hematopoietic regeneration. The central hypothesis will be
tested under two specific aims: 1) Determine molecular and cellular mechanisms of Sema4a effects on
myHSC; and 2) Define therapeutic opportunities for Sema4a as a myHSC “protector” from proliferative stress.
Under the first aim, genetic mouse models, single-cell RNA Sequencing and intravital microscopy will be used
to evaluate the effect of microenvironmental deletion of Sema4a or its putative receptor, Plexin D1, on myHSC
and to uncover the role of Sema4a as myHSC-specific hematopoietic regulator. Under the second aim, my-
HSC protective properties of Sema4a will be explored in clinically relevant models of functional HSC loss, such
as exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and ex-vivo HSC culture during gene modification procedure. The
research proposed in this application is innovative, in candidate’s opinion, because it builds on a novel
discovery of Sema4a as a potent and indispensable regulator of myHSC in vivo, and provides substantive new
experimental evidence for the concept that functionally specialized HSC are controlled by distinct regulatory
circuits. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to serve as a scientific justification for
future therapeutic strategies to improve hematopoietic regeneration following chemotherapy and stem cell
transplantation, enhance engraftment of gene-modified HSC and prevent myeloid bias, age-related HSC
dysfunction and evolution to myeloid malignancy in the elderly."
10759382,"Aging (referring to middle age) is commonly associated with visceral adiposity and insulin resistance. Impaired
white adipose tissue (AT) “browning” and reduced energy expenditure that also occur in aging may contribute to
age-linked adiposity, yet how AT browning and metabolism are regulated with age remains incompletely
understood. AT inflammation, including T cell–related inflammation, has been implicated in metabolic dysfunction
in obesity. Conventional T cells (Tcn) are elevated and promote inflammation in obese AT, whereas regulatory
T cells (Treg) are enriched in lean AT and markedly reduced in obese AT. AT (fat) Treg (fTreg) protect against
inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. With aging, Tcn are also elevated in AT; but unlike in obesity, in
aging fTreg are elevated and may promote adiposity and insulin resistance. The mechanism for the difference
in fTreg in aging and obesity and the role of Tcn in age-linked metabolic functions are largely unknown. In our
pilot study, despite increased number, fTreg in aging mice were dysfunctional and impaired in repressing Tcn
proliferation, and Tcn (elevated in AT with age) inhibited adipocyte browning (both by direct contact with
adipocytes and through secreted molecules). Thus, we hypothesize that fTreg dysfunction with Tcn inflammation
plays a pivotal role in age-linked adiposity and insulin resistance via adverse regulation of AT browning and
metabolism. Mechanistically, STAT1, a key transcription factor for Treg regulation and Tcn inflammation, was
elevated and activated in AT T cells (which include Treg and Tcn) of aging mice and increased in human AT
with age; and, importantly, STAT1 ablation in T cells in mice improved age-linked fTreg functions, reduced AT
Tcn inflammation, and prevented adiposity, with increased AT browning and energy expenditure, and improved
insulin sensitivity, supporting a pivotal role of STAT1 in age-linked fTreg dysfunction, Tcn inflammation, and
adiposity. In this application, we propose to examine further the role and mechanism of T cells including Tcn and
fTreg in age-linked inflammation and metabolic functions in three aims: aim 1 will examine how Tcn (direct drivers
of inflammation) contribute to AT inflammation and metabolic functions with age in mice and by tissue culture;
aim 2 will examine how Treg (regulators of inflammation) contribute to AT inflammation and metabolic functions
with age in mice; aim 3 will examine effects of dietary and pharmacologic inhibition of the STAT1 pathway on
age-linked fTreg function, inflammation, and metabolic functions in mice. Several novel mouse models generated
in PI's lab and human AT specimens, with flow cytometry, quantitative PCR, RNA-seq, whole-body and tissue-
specific metabolic assays, and other techniques, will be used. Our proposal aims to reveal how T cells, including
Tcn and fTreg, contribute to AT inflammation and metabolic functions in aging and may help develop novel
therapies to mitigate age-related inflammation and prevent metabolic disease with aging."
10759384,"Background: The VA is tasked with providing specialty care services for ~4 million Veterans annually, and
specialty care for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) provides representative challenges and opportunities to
improve access to high-quality care. Almost 50% of Veterans are at high risk for OSA, and care to diagnose
and treat OSA can improve quality of life and health outcomes. However, the VA has limited capacity to meet
demands for OSA care with just over 300 sleep providers nationwide, and these specialists are concentrated in
VA medical centers (VAMCs), far from many Veterans. Referrals to community care providers represent one
strategy to meet demands for OSA testing, but these community referrals often lead to delayed and more
expensive care than necessary. As an alternative, a virtual approach incorporating E-consultation is used at
some VA medical centers to improve the reach and capacity of VA sleep providers. However, the effect of
virtual consults on important OSA treatment outcomes is unknown. Furthermore, virtual consults themselves
do not address the need for on-site services to train Veterans to use necessary testing and treatment
equipment. The nominee plans to address these gaps by refining and testing the feasibility and effectiveness
of a virtual consult pathway to provide care to Veterans at rural community based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).
His intervention will consist of virtual sleep consults supplemented with embedded respiratory therapists to
provide services on-site. The nominee also seeks to understand the cost implications of current approaches to
meet Veterans' OSA testing needs, and estimate the budget impact of expanding VA based services.
Significance/Impact: Dr. Donovan's research addresses three key VA priorities. (1) Provide greater choice
for Veterans: The virtual consult intervention will allow more Veterans to choose VA services rather than rely
solely on community care. (2) Focus resources more efficiently: His research pilots an intervention intended
to provide more affordable and effective OSA care. (3) Improve timeliness of care: The proposed work seeks
to improve access to proximal and timely sleep care for Veterans otherwise referred to the community.
Innovation: The virtual care intervention challenges the current medical center focused model of VA specialty
care. Dr. Donovan's intervention would redeploy respiratory therapists to provide necessary on-site services for
OSA care at CBOCs, obtain specialist input through E-consultations, and use VA ECHO telementorship
sessions to support the ongoing engagement and training of remote providers. In addition, Dr. Donovan plans
novel budget impact analyses to inform where it is more advantageous for the VA to expand existing sleep
services or purchase them from the community (i.e “make vs. buy”).
Specific Aims: (1) Assess Veteran and provider perspectives regarding initial OSA care. (2) Test the
feasibility and acceptability of a virtual consult pathway for initial OSA care. (3) Assess the nationwide impact
of community care referrals for OSA testing on diagnostic costs, timeliness to care, and treatment adherence.
Methodology: In Aim 1, Dr. Donovan will conduct qualitative interviews among 20 Veterans referred to sleep
care in the community, and 12 VA care providers. In Aim 2, Dr. Donovan will enroll 70 Veterans in a pilot
randomized trial of a virtual consult pathway versus community care referrals, and this pilot will address the
feasibility of procedures and data collection necessary for a definitive trial. In Aim 3, Dr. Donovan will assess
nationwide costs of OSA care for VA relative to Community Care. Dr. Donovan will use these costs to perform
budget impact analyses of expanding VA-based care relative to community care referrals.
Next Steps/Implementation: The research and training activities in this award will enable the nominee to
conduct a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. This multi-site trial will test the effectiveness of
virtual sleep care relative to community care referrals to improve patient reported OSA symptoms, experience,
and costs, while simultaneously engaging in a process evaluation to identify barriers to implementation."
10759386,"Abstract
Individuals on the autism spectrum experience a “services cliff” when they transition to adulthood, and have
poor health and social outcomes over the life course. In response, the National Institute of Mental Health has
highly prioritized services research to improve life outcomes for autistic adults. The lack of validated patient-
reported outcome measures (PROMs) for use with autistic adults is a significant barrier to conducting high-
quality services research with this population. The Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and
Education (AASPIRE) has been conducting community based participatory research (CBPR) in partnership
with autistic adults, family members, and services professionals for over twelve years. We have used a
collaborative process to adapt survey instruments to be accessible to autistic adults with diverse
characteristics. More work is needed to create a full package of high-priority PROMs and to rigorously assess
their psychometric properties. Our long-term goal is to improve life outcomes for autistic adults. The objective
of this proposal is to use a CBPR approach to create and test a package of PROMs for evaluating the
effectiveness of services interventions for autistic adults across multiple real-world settings. We will achieve
our objective by meeting the following specific aims: 1) to collaboratively create the Autism Patient Reported
Outcomes Measures (AutPROM) Toolbox; 2) to psychometrically test the AutPROM Toolbox measures at
baseline and assess expected distributions; and 3) to assess the instruments’ sensitivity in detecting change
and explore factors that may be associated with change in outcomes over time. We will use a modified Delphi
process to identify constructs and measures to include in the AutPROM Toolbox. We will then work with our
diverse Community Council to collaboratively adapt instruments, as needed. Where appropriate, we will create
two versions of each measure – one for use by autistic adults and one for use by proxies. We will conduct
cognitive interviews to establish content validity and comprehensibility of the adapted instruments. We will then
test the full AutPROM Toolbox in a real-world cohort of 750 autistic adults, with sub-cohorts recruited from 1)
healthcare systems; 2) disability services systems; and 3) community organizations. We will conduct surveys
with participants at baseline and 6 and 12 months, and will use longitudinal growth curve modeling to test
change over time and identify participant characteristics that are associated with changes in outcomes. We will
use qualitative methods to understand how changes in scores on AutPROM Toolbox instruments correspond
to participants’ narratives of how their life may have changed during the study period. The proposed project will
create a critically-needed set of PROMs that can be used to evaluate services interventions for autistic adults
across multiple real-world settings. The project will also identify factors that predict changes in life outcomes
over time. Such information is key to understanding and improving existing services, refining and targeting new
interventions, and informing policy."
10759387,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The fovea is a highly specialized retinal structure located within the macula responsible for high-
acuity vision, which in humans enables critical tasks such as reading and recognizing faces.
Foveal diseases such as macular degeneration are highly debilitating and often lead to blindness.
However, there are no current available treatments or therapies for fovea-specific disorders. A
major reason underlying this limitation is the lack of suitable experimental systems for foveal
studies, as only a small number of species have fovea-like high acuity areas (HAA). Indeed,
among mammals, only a subset of primates has foveated retinas. However, avian species
including the chick, possess fovea-like HAA and can be used as a powerful model system to study
the molecular underpinnings of fovea formation in vivo. Human stem cell-derived retinal organoids
(hRetOrg) have emerged as a promising in vitro system to study human retinal disorders but
current protocols fail to generate foveae. We have recently found that retinoic acid (RA) signaling
is highly patterned during foveogenesis in humans and is required for HAA formation in the chick.
Our hypothesis is that recapitulation of endogenous patterns of RA signaling in hRetOrg is
sufficient to induce fovea formation. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize the chick system to
elucidate the spatiotemporal properties of RA-dependent fovea induction in vivo (Aim 1);
longitudinally characterize the dynamics of RA signaling and expression profile of RA enzymes
during retinogenesis period in hRetOrg (Aim 2); experimentally manipulate RA signaling to
recapitulate the spatiotemporal patterns of RA found in vivo in the in vitro hRetOrg system (Aim
3). To achieve this we have developed an innovative molecular strategy based on transposon-
and doxycycline-inducible systems for precise spatial and temporal regulation of transgenesis
and optimized high-speed high-resolution imaging analysis of whole chick retinas and 3D
hRetOrg. This effort will not only advance our current understanding of the mechanistic role of RA
signaling as a fovea regulator but also generate an innovative and much needed foveated
hRetOrg system with high translational potential for diseases affecting the fovea through disease
modeling, high-throughput drug screening and as a source of clinically-relevant fovea-specific
cells for transplantation."
10759392,"Background: Chronic pain disproportionately affects Veterans and is often managed in VA primary care.
Because chronic pain may exhibit physical, emotional, social, and existential dimensions, individualized,
interdisciplinary approaches are clinically important. Various pain team models have been implemented in
diverse clinical settings, and some are effective. However, to meet the complex needs of specific patients, pain
teams often benefit from dynamic membership and different providers (e.g., pharmacist) fulfilling specific roles
or tasks (e.g., opioid tapering). The providers who come together around one patient may or may not work
together regularly or in the same combinations on other patients. In fact, dynamic teams and bounded teams
often overlap. Compared with bounded teams, dynamic teaming, which I refer to hereafter as “teaming”, is a
more complex process with a smaller empiric research base. Whether teams are bounded or dynamic (and
often they have elements of both), they need to coordinate/negotiate and understand their mutual roles and
role boundaries to serve patients effectively. Facilitating “teaming”, through establishing scaffolds, represents a
strategy for organizing providers with dynamic membership around shared patient care goals.
Significance/Impact: Developing a “teaming” intervention to facilitate collaboration around the numerous tasks
involved in providing good and safe pain management is particularly timely as it aligns with the VA ORD clinical
priorities. This work will be done in partnership with Veterans, providers, and operational leaders from the
national pain program office to ensure alignment with VA pain and opioid initiatives.
Innovation: The proposed intervention will create team scaffolds and a teaming facilitation process for
interdisciplinary providers that participate in pain care tasks. The integration of organizational theory and co-
design principals and strategies to produce and test a teaming intervention represents a novel approach for
improving processes of pain care in the VA.
Specific Aims: This proposal seeks to address scientific gaps through three projects. AIM1: Identify roles,
structures and processes of interdisciplinary providers involved in primary care based chronic pain management.
AIM2: Co-design an intervention to improve interdisciplinary “teaming” with VA providers and Veterans. AIM3:
Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of a teaming intervention for improved pain management at one site.
Methodology: To yield insights on teams, teamwork and teaming and AIM3 study features for trial design, AIM1a
will complete a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of chronic pain care in primary care settings.
To characterize the concept of dynamic teaming and garner insights on teaming for chronic pain in PACTs, 1b
will use semi-structured interviews to explore experiences and perceptions of PACT providers, pharmacists, pain
specialists, non-pharmacologic providers, and supervisors/leadership (n=45). Building on AIM1 insights and
principles and processes of co-design, I will build a logic model 1) of the problem and 2) for the desired change.
I will conduct 3) theory-based design and 4) intervention production with providers and Veterans, followed by 5)
implementation planning with the practical, robust implementation and sustainability Model (PRISM), and 6)
evaluation planning. Patients (n=30) and interdisciplinary PACT teams (n=10) involved in “teaming” around
chronic pain management at the VA Palo Alto will be recruited for the pilot of an intervention arm to inform
feasibility and acceptably of a subsequent randomized trial. Following this pilot work, I will apply for an HSR&D
IIR to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial (usual pain processes vs. “teaming” intervention).
Implementation/Next Steps: Through the successful execution of this work, we will be prepared to submit a VA
HSR&D merit award application for a fully powered trial of the “teaming” intervention in comparison to usual care.
The co-design process and resultant teaming intervention will serve as a model to develop strategies to support
clinicians teaming in a diverse array of VA settings."
10759393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Steady-state hematopoiesis in bone marrow is critical for maintenance of blood cell genesis and immune
competence throughout life. Concomitant with aging, the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
compartment undergoes cell intrinsic and extrinsic changes that biases hematopoietic output toward the
myeloid lineage. The bias in HSC-subset predominance and change in hematopoietic output contributes to
immune dysfunction in the elderly including an increased propensity to infection and lessened vaccine
responses. Thus, studies focused on understanding essential regulators that support a non-biased, balanced
HSC pool that supports lymphoid differentiation capability has the potential to provide novel therapeutic
avenues to rejuvenate HSC developmental trajectories to restore immune function in the aged. The homeobox
transcription factor Hoxa9 is expressed in primitive HSCs and is inactivated upon lineage commitment. Mice
with germline deletion of hoxa9 are viable but display multilineage deficiencies that are transplantable,
confirming a cell intrinsic defect. Competitive transplantation experiments revealed impaired long-term
repopulating ability and in vitro studies showed poor proliferative responses to early-acting cytokines. In bone
marrow, hoxa9-/- mice exhibit reduced cellularity, impaired lymphoid priming, reductions in lympho-myeloid
progenitors, common lymphoid progenitors, and B cell precursors. Hoxa9-/- mice also have smaller thymi, and
reductions in early thymic progenitors. Interestingly, flow cytometric analysis of the long-term repopulating stem
cell compartment (LT-HSC) in young adult hoxa9-/- mice revealed increased frequencies of LT-HSCs
expressing high levels of the CD150, which is functionally associated with myeloid skewing. This is contrasted
by significant decreases in frequencies of CD150lo LT-HSC in hoxa9-/- marrow, which have balanced lympho-
myeloid potential. Increased numbers of myeloid-biased HSCs along with diminished lymphopoiesis is
reminiscent of aging. A Hoxa9 target gene implicated in age-associated alterations in lymphopoiesis and B cell
genesis in the marrow is p16ink4a. The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a is virtually undetectable in
HSC and B cell precursors from young mice but increases in both subsets with age. Realtime PCR of Lin-
Sca1+ hematopoietic progenitors from young hoxa9-/- mice revealed increased mRNA transcripts for
p16ink4a. To determine if over expression of p16ink4a was the molecular basis of the lymphoid/B cell
deficiency in hoxa9-/- mice, we generated hoxa9-/-p16ink4a-/- mice. Importantly, deletion of p16ink4a restored
bone marrow and thymus cellularity and rescued the deficiencies in lymphoid, B and T cell precursors in
hoxa9-/- mice. These novel experimental findings support the hypothesis that Hoxa9 suppression of p16ink4a
is critical for lymphopoiesis. At present, there is a paucity of information regarding the role of Hoxa9 in
regulation of lympho-hematopoiesis. The studies detailed in this proposal are aimed at filling this gap in the
knowledge."

Type 2 diabetes is a major public health concern. Diabetes currently affects 25.8 million people in the US alone
and 90-95% of all cases are type 2. There are many complications related to diabetes, including a significantly
increased risk of heart disease and stroke, blindness, kidney failure and kidney disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, neuropathy, hearing loss and lower-limb amputations. There are several risk factors predisposing
individuals to the development of this disease including demographic characteristics like sex, age and ethnicity;
and behavioral and lifestyle-related modifications. In addition, metabolic determinants such as impaired glucose
tolerance and insulin resistance increase the risk of an individual progressing to type 2 diabetes. Significant
diabetes health disparities exist in minority populations, including Hispanics and African Americans, where
prevalence of diabetes is increased. Evidence from both epidemiological and lipidomic studies have shown that
specific lipoproteins and their constituent lipids are important factors in the development of type 2 diabetes,
where, like many other metabolic diseases, lipid metabolism is disrupted. The classical lipid parameters most
commonly examined in relation to disease risk are themselves complex entities composed of multiple lipid
species. We hypothesize that these basic lipid species represent intermediate phenotypes that lie closer to the
genomic level in the interplay between phenotype and disease, and therefore may be better predictors of disease
risk and increase the pace of discovery of genes causally involved in lipid variation and type 2 diabetes.
In this project, we will exploit whole genome sequence (WGS) information in powerful extended pedigrees of
Mexican American individuals in combination with comprehensive measures of the human lipidome, to identify
novel genes and functional variants influencing lipid variation and type 2 diabetes, in an effort to reduce the
diabetes health disparities evident in Hispanic populations. The combination of these precise biological lipid
phenotypes and WGS gives us an unprecedented opportunity to identify novel genes and functional variants
influencing human lipid variation and risk of diabetes. To achieve these objectives, we will (I) measure T2D risk
phenotypes including targeted lipid profiling of more than 800 lipid species; and multiple measures of metabolic
function, and perform quantitative genetic analyses; (II) identify sequence variation influencing lipid variation and
diabetes in all individuals using WGS; (Ill) perform hypothesis based replication in an independent Mexican
American population; and (IV) perform functional assessments of variants of interest in relevant iPSC-derived
cells and analyze free and total fatty acid content in a subset of the cohort.
The estimated economic burden of diabetes in the United States alone is approximately $245 billion per year,
making this disease of major public health importance. The ability to identify genes that are causally involved in
disease risk provides an unparalleled opportunity to quickly determine biological pathways that are involved in
disease pathology. A better understanding of the genetic contribution to lipid variation and diabetes development
will provide novel approaches for the characterization, treatment and potential prevention of this costly disease."

Lyme disease, caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi or closely related species, is the most
common vector-borne disease in the United States, accounting for nearly 500,000 infections per year according
to recent public health estimates. It is also one of the few infectious diseases that requires a two-step laboratory
testing protocol, comprising a screening assay, typically ELISA, followed by a confirmatory immunoblot. This
protocol is followed where the disease has progressed beyond the hallmark erythema migrans rash, or the rash
cannot be identified, and symptoms or history suggest Lyme disease. The two-step protocol is a result of the
poor specificity of most Lyme screening tests, which lead to a high false positive rate. This in turn is due to the
cross-reactive nature of many bacterial antigens, combined with the limitations of conventional ELISA
immunochemistry. In principle, a confirmatory result must be obtained prior to initiating treatment, but in practice,
the multi-day delay that is often incurred in this process frequently leads physicians to prescribe antibiotic
treatment in the absence of definitive lab results. As the vast majority of the more than three million annual Lyme
tests in the U.S. are carried out on individuals who are ultimately found not to have Lyme disease, this practice
leads to the unnecessary prescription and use of antibiotics, contributing to the growth of antibiotic resistance
which has become a significant threat to public health. A first step test with significantly higher specificity would
avoid the need for a second step test and enable clinicians to make informed treatment decisions in a timely
manner, based on credible test results.
This project is aimed at bringing about a significant change in medical practice by reducing Lyme testing from
the current two-step process to a one-step process. To achieve this objective, we have developed a novel ELISA
methodology for Lyme antibody detection that enables exceptionally high assay specificity. The test is based
on well-established, highly specific and sensitive Borrelia antigens in a unique immunochemical format. The
novel ELISA immunochemistry eliminates almost all non-specific reactivity, yielding results comparable in
specificity but higher in sensitivity than those obtained with the conventional two-tier testing protocol.
Consequently, this assay promises to deliver a one-step testing solution for Lyme disease, at a time when
alternatives to the original two-step method are gaining legitimacy at the scientific as well as regulatory level.
In Phase I, we developed a prototype ELISA assay, proving feasibility by demonstrating higher sensitivity and
equivalent specificity on retrospective samples comprising Lyme patients and controls, in comparison with two-
tier testing results. In Phase II, we will complete development of the assay into a commercial product, carry out
prospective and retrospective clinical studies and submit a 510(k) application to FDA for use of the ELISA as a
one-step test for Lyme disease, enabling commercial launch upon approval."
10760227,"Functional genomics studies have identified an enrichment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk variants in active
enhancers of human myeloid cells. These data, along with myeloid-specific expression of several AD risk genes,
strongly implicate these cells in the etiology of AD. Partial loss-of-function mutations in Triggering Receptor
Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), linked to increased risk for AD, point to a protective role for TREM2
against neurodegeneration. Microglia are known to play numerous beneficial functions in the brain, including
clearance of dying cells as well as cellular debris and orchestrate complex responses to tissue stress or damage.
However, chronic activation of microglia can lead to toxic neuroinflammation and impairment of homeostatic
functions. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective functions of microglia is
critical to identifying therapeutic targets to prevent or delay AD onset. Using fine mapping approaches, we have
identified likely causal genes within many AD GWAS loci. In one locus, the gene encoding embryonic ectoderm
development (EED) is a strong candidate causal gene and a putative target of a myeloid cell enhancer containing
an AD-associated functional variant. EED is an essential, non-catalytic component of the polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2), which functions to maintain the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. Modulation of
H3K27me3 is critical for epigenetic remodeling following inflammatory stimuli and has been implicated in
microglial clearance of apoptotic cells. Cytoplasmic PRC2 (cPRC2), also exhibits direct signaling activity,
controlling receptor-driven activation of Erk as well as actin polymerization in immune cells, cellular processes
implicated by our AD genetics studies. Furthermore, our preliminary data show that microglial Eed-/- on the
5XFAD background phenocopies TREM2-/-. Based on these genetic and biochemical observations we
hypothesize that EED and PRC2 operate as a master regulator of the TREM2 signaling pathway and that factors
that control PRC2 expression levels and activity define the TREM2 driven neuroprotective microglial state. To
test this hypothesis, we propose 4 aims to examine the impact of Eed/PRC2 on both human and mouse microglial
function and Trem2 signaling in vitro and in vivo. We will determine the role of EED/PRC2 loss of function on
microglial function and TREM2 signaling using both mouse and human microglia in vitro (aim 1) and in vivo in
5XFAD mice (aim 2). In aim 3 we will examine the impact of cytoplasmic PRC2 on microglial function and Trem2
signaling in vitro and in vivo. In aim 4 we will use human genetic data to test for enrichment of AD risk alleles
within the Trem2 signaling pathway genes and in the Eed regulatory network and determine the impact of select
alleles on microglial function and Trem2 signaling. Finally, we will test for epistasis by examining the impact of
Eed+/- on Trem2 haploinsufficiency in 5XFAD mice in vivo and in hiPSC-derived microglia in vitro."

11010491,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A highly effective intervention to prevent perinatal depression, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for perinatal
depression (MBCT), exists; however, critical implementation gaps prevent its wide use. And though universally
recommended, not all prenatal care clinics effectively screen for perinatal depression (PD). Overcoming current
implementation gaps is imperative to address the public health crisis of high US maternal morbidity and mortality.
With prevalence ranges from 11 – 20% of the 3.8 million people who birth every year, PD is one of the most
common childbearing morbidities. And deaths of despair (suicide; overdose) is the leading cause of maternal
death. Though rates of perinatal depression are higher, mental health care is less available among underserved
women [Black and/or Indigenous and/or Medicaid users]. Recent federally funded maternal mortality review
results indicate that 100% of perinatal depression related deaths were preventable. Pregnancy is the optimal
time to realize prevention: pregnancy timed intervention is both critical (early intervention improves outcomes)
and feasible (prenatal care standardly includes 10-12 clinical visits, and pregnant people are highly motivated to
receive prenatal care). CenterMom, Inc. is advancing solutions to these problems via the Center M product: an
adaptation of MBCT designed to improve intervention delivery in our target population. Center M pilot work
indicates the need for smartphone app delivery of PD screening and home practice materials to succeed in this
effort. The purpose of the proposed Phase I STTR is to prototype a smartphone app that can effectively deliver
appealing PD screening and Center M home practice materials and test the Center M product inclusive of this
app. The overarching hypothesis to this line of inquiry is that pregnant people randomized to the app inclusive
Center M intervention, vs. treatment as usual (TAU), will receive significantly better PD screening, will have lower
rates of PD at 6 weeks postpartum, and will be highly satisfied with their antenatal preventive mental health care.
The proposed work is a critical step to achieving MBCT-PD portability within standard prenatal care health
systems and acceptability among underserved pregnant people. Our team, including experts in biomedical
commercialization, psychology, mindfulness, community-partnerships, Black maternal health, and prenatal care
health systems will critically inform two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Build a Center M app prototype consistent
with underserved, pregnant end user needs. We will conduct 4 focus groups consisting of 5 pregnant end users
per group (N=20) focusing on identifying user needs. Using this data and preliminary data, we will complete the
app prototype. Then we will conduct app prototype usability testing with 20 additional pregnant people (n = 20).
Specific Aim 2: Test efficacy and effectiveness of Center M vs. TAU. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial
with 90 pregnant people to test Center M vs. TAU. We will track rates of PD screening and depression scores
through 6-weeks postpartum and PD care patient satisfaction. Study findings will inform STTR Phase II."
10931474,"ABSTRACT | PUERTO RICO BIOBANK
The Puerto Rico BioBank (PRBB) Shared Resource of the Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer
Center (PHSU-MCC) Partnership collects, processes, annotates, stores, and distributes biospecimens and
clinical-demographic data for investigator-initiated translational cancer research. As of August 2022, the PRBB
has consented 4,097 subjects representing 42 different cancer types and healthy individuals. From these
subjects, 1,899 clinical history and demographic surveys were completed and 8,453 biospecimens were
collected. Tissues, derivative analytes (e.g., DNA/RNA), data, and tissue microarrays have been distributed to
research projects supporting publications and grant submissions. The PRBB contributed to the development of
a Biobanking clerkship for medical students in collaboration with the Research Education Core (REC) and
contributed to education efforts in H/L communities in both Tampa and Ponce in collaboration with the Outreach
Core (OC). Together with the Quantitative Sciences Core (QSC), the PRBB has consented 142 H/L patients to
the ORIEN-Avatar network (https://www.oriencancer.org) improving the representation of H/L tissues in this
network, dedicated to accelerating the discovery of novel targeted cancer treatments, that is currently only 7.2%.
The PRBB participates in international consortia including REBLAC (Latin American and Caribbean Biobanking
network), PRACTICAL (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the
Genome), LAGENO-BC (Latin America Genomics of Breast Cancer Consortium), the Latino Colorectal Cancer
Consortium (LC3), the Confluence Project for Breast Cancer Genetics. The objective of the PRBB is to address
the critical unmet need in cancer health disparities of a lack of representation of H/L patients in comprehensive
molecular datasets at levels that align with the prevalence of cancer in this population. The aims are: 1) Support
research projects by targeted recruitment of patients of selected cancer types along with non-cancer controls.
Recruitment is both broad to build a comprehensive database for future projects and focused on the currently
proposed full research projects in prostate and ovarian cancer. We will continue to optimize the logistics of patient
education and consenting at collaborating physician’s offices and San Lucas Hospital (SLH) and by maintaining
constant contact with Project PIs. 2) Support research by developing innovative resources and services. We will

10931478,"ABSTRACT | QUANTITATIVE SCIENCES CORE
The Quantitative Sciences Core (QSC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center (PHSU-
MCC) Partnership provides resources and expertise for generating, managing, and analyzing big data. It is the
focal point for expertise in quantitative approaches to address the underrepresentation of Hispanic/Latino (H/L)
populations in “omics” studies and to incorporate ancestry analysis in Partnership research approaches. By
joining PHSU's expertise in genetic ancestry with the MCC bioinformatics team, the QSC combines a unique set
of skills required to address the molecular components of cancer disparities in admixed H/L populations. The
QSC provides expertise in bioinformatics, biostatistics, and informatics, and participates in every phase of the
research life cycle. The QSC supports data provisioning, study design, analysis plans, and power estimates to
demonstrate the feasibility and improve rigor and reproducibility in all Partnership research projects and grant
submissions. In addition, the QSC contributes to the dissemination of high-throughput molecular data by
developing web-based visualization tools. As a central resource for research projects, the QSC also facilitates
collaboration, thereby leveraging the data gathered by the Partnership investigators. The QSC analyzed the first
H/L genomic data generated in collaboration with the Puerto Rico BioBank (PRBB)/Oncology Research
Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) Avatar and implemented the H/L Bioportal (GLOBAL), a web-based
resource. The QSC develops tools for visualizing and interpreting data, pipelines to estimate genetic ancestry,
and has built expertise in genomics bioinformatics at the Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), including hiring,
training, and the acquisition of computing and storage infrastructure. The Specific Aims of the QSC will be: 1)
Provide research project support for biostatistics and bioinformatics from study design, endpoint definition,
sample size estimation, power calculation, and data analysis. Regular interactions between lead data scientists
and project members will allow for the continuing development of novel analytic tools to address emerging
questions aligned with the Partnership’s needs. 2) Provide data integration and management services for
Partnership projects and cores. Projects needing tissue/data collection systems will leverage the existing
software infrastructure from PRBB Biospecimen Management System (BMS). The QSC/PRBB Data Concierge
provisions data and linkages from these systems. Other supported services include the H/L Bioportal, Estimated
Cell Line Ancestry (ECLA) tool, and the Partnership Continuous Quality Improvement System for the Planning
& Evaluation Core. 3) Provide quantitative sciences expertise in support of the Partnership. The QSC aims to
develop expertise in statistics at the HSI; characterize publicly available molecular signatures in Partnership
cohorts; develop analytics for PRBB optimization of consent and participant communications; expand the omics
experience for students (collaboration with the Research Education Core) and enhance the use of ancestry in
quantitative studies."
10931484,"ABSTRACT | FULL RESEARCH PROJECT 2
Growing evidence indicates that the biological response to chronic stress and subsequent distress can
promote the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer via prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous
system and sustained norepinephrine release. Downstream consequences of norepinephrine exposure
include increased prostaglandin-related inflammation and an immunosuppressive landscape. Conversely,
increasing evidence supports the role of aspirin use in ovarian cancer prevention and survival. Yet, key
questions remain about the underlying biological mechanism of action of chronic stress/distress and aspirin
use (considering low and standard doses separately) and their interrelationship with ovarian cancer biology.
Specifically, we propose to evaluate the hypothesis that distress enhances ovarian cancer progression by
promoting inflammatory and immune processes and that aspirin abrogates these effects. Our innovative study
uses unique population-based and experimental resources. Aim 1 will use data from four long-term
prospective cohorts in diverse populations, a population-based case-control study, a hospital case series that
collected self-reported measures of chronic stress and distress (e.g., depression), and ovarian tumor tissue.
Aim 1 will measure gene expression in bulk high grade serous tumor samples (to capture the full tumor
microenvironment) using whole exome RNASeq. We hypothesize that distress is associated with the up-
regulation of inflammation-related and immune suppression gene expression pathways that is normalized
among aspirin users. We will also assess if the association of distress with ovarian cancer risk is attenuated
among aspirin users. Notably, we are leveraging racially and ethnically diverse studies that have highly
characterized ovarian cancer cases, allowing assessment of differences in association by race (Black,
White) and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), as well as the examination of associations between distress-
related gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes. Using an orthogonal and interactive approach, Aim 2
will use experimental ovarian cancer mouse models to characterize the progressive effect over time of daily
restraint stress on tumor inflammation and immunity as well as ovarian tumor growth, using RNASeq and
stress hormones measured via ELISA assays. We also will examine if aspirin (recapitulating equivalents of
low and standard dose aspirin in humans) counteracts the effects of chronic stress on tumor progression and
inflammatory and immune gene expression networks. This project will leverage the scientific services of
several cores, including the Puerto Rico BioBank (PRBB) and the Quantitative Science Core (QSC), with
substantial interaction with the Outreach Core, the Planning and Evaluation Core, and working with trainees in
the Research Education Core. This innovative application will inform future work to develop novel immuno-
preventive strategies, pharmacotherapies, and psychosocial interventions to prevent and treat invasive
ovarian cancer in women who experience chronic stress and distress."
10931493,"ABSTRACT | PLANNING AND EVALUATION CORE (PEC)
The Planning and Evaluation Core (PEC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center
(PHSU-MCC) Partnership monitors and evaluates progress toward the implementation of the goals and
objectives of the Partnership across all areas including research, education, and community outreach. The PEC
serves as a central node for accountability and ensures that the Partnership is completing proposed aims and
objectives through its evaluative framework. The PEC evaluation processes allow for the Administrative Core
(AC) to maximize resources, identify novel directions for the Partnership, and report the progress of Partnership
cores and investigators to institutional leaders and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The PEC maintains
internal and external advisory groups to support strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation of Partnership
activities by assessing the relationships between aims, activities, outputs, and expected outcomes. The two
essential PEC advisory groups are the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee
(PSC). The IAC and PSC work closely together within the PEC to provide guidance and recommendations to
the AC. The PEC establishes Logic Models for each Partnership component and provides continual updating to
reflect the new aims, activities, and evolution of the Partnership. The PEC, in collaboration with the Quantitative
Sciences Core (QSC), implemented the use of REDCap to track grants and publications (including journal impact
factors) submitted and obtained by the Partnership researchers to streamline tracking. The PEC is a member of
the Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity Evaluators Special Interest Group (PACHE SIG), which works
to identify common elements for the evaluation of PACHE programs at the national level. The PEC will build on
prior successes with the necessary flexibility to adapt and respond to emerging challenges, innovations, and
developments. The specific aims of the PEC are: 1) Coordinate collection, tracking, and analysis of evaluation
data for Partnership components processes and activities. This provides the AC with critical data needed to
initiate, terminate, or modify new and ongoing initiatives to achieve the Partnership goals and objectives. The
PEC incorporates Logic Models, web-based relational data systems for tracking outcomes, and annual
Partnership member surveys to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of communications, interactions, and
integration between/across Partnership components at both institutions. 2) Conduct internal evaluations of
Partnership components through the activities of the IAC. The IAC will review quarterly progress reports for the
Cores and research projects and provide summative feedback. The IAC will also collaborate with the AC to solicit
and evaluate new research projects. 3) Implement external evaluations of Partnership components through the
activities of the PSC and an external evaluation consultant. The PSC provides unbiased, rigorous, and expert
evaluation of the progress of the Partnership annually and recommends improvements throughout the grant
period via quarterly meetings with the AC."
10933470,"Most luminal B breast cancers (LBBC; ER+, HER2-wt, Ki67>14%) carry a good prognosis. However,
approximately 20% of LBBC are highly aggressive and resistant to current therapies. Poor-prognosis LBBC
disproportionally impact women of African descent; the majority are MYC-activated. There have been many
failed attempts to therapeutically target MYC. These attempts have failed, in part, due to our current inability to
separate the cancer-promoting activities of MYC, mechanistically or therapeutically, from its normal essential
cellular functions. In preliminary data, we show that the cancer-transforming ability of MYC is dependent on three
lysine (K) residues of MYC (K149, K158, and K323) that are major substrates for acetylation by the histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and GCN5; individual substitutions of these specific sites block the ability of
MYC to transform human mammary cells. Guided by our preliminary data, here we aim to dissect the cofactors
and molecular mechanisms by which these MYC acetyl-K (AcK) residues promote cell transformation and
initiation and progression of LBBC. Our long-term goal is to identify new “druggable” targets to improve survival
of women most affected by aggressive LBBC; consequently, our studies will focus on women of African-descent.
Guided by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that a gene-selective MYC-AcK signaling pathway drives the
aggressive tumor cell biology of therapy-resistant LBBC and involves transcription cofactors and epigenetic
coregulators that “write” and/or “read” AcK marks on MYC and histones, perhaps including cofactors co-
overexpressed with MYC in LBBC, such as PIN1, GCN5, p300, and/or YEATS2. Here, we will investigate the
role of MYC-AcK dependent signaling in luminal mammary cell transformation and aggressive progression of
luminal cancer cells and LBBC tumors as well as identify the cofactors and mechanisms involved.
Characterization of this new MYC oncogenic signaling pathway may provide biomarkers and/or therapeutic
targets for LBBC in women of African descent. Aim 1 will test the impact of MYC-AcK dependent signaling in
mammary epithelial cell transformation and in the aggressive biology of LBBC in women of African-descent. Aim
2 will characterize the molecular mechanisms of MYC-AcK dependent gene regulation in transformed mammary
epithelial cells and in LBBC cells and tumors from women of African-descent."
10933473,"PIN1 is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that controls proline-mediated phosphorylation signaling events that is
overexpressed both in pancreatic cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. PIN1 overexpression is a major
contributor to tumorigenesis, activating several oncoproteins, including proteins in the KRAS pathway, and
simultaneously inactivating several tumor suppressors. Recent studies using genetic and pharmacological
inhibitors show that PIN1 regulates key oncogenic pathways. Importantly, PIN1 promotes an
immunosuppressive/treatment-resistant TME, by up-regulating PD-L1 (programmed cell-death receptor-1) The
chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, is frequently used in front-line treatment of pancreatic cancer. PIN1 also drives
chemotherapy-resistance by degrading the gemcitabine uptake-transporter, ENT1 (equillabrative nuclear
transporter-1) both in tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Hence, the development of PIN1 inhibitors
could increase sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The laboratory of Dr.
Pellecchia (University of California Riverside; UCR) has developed initial PIN1 inhibitors that have promising
pharmacokinetic properties. To do this, Dr. Pellecchia used a drug discovery strategy based on a combination
of biophysical methods including 1) medicinal chemistry 2) NMR spectroscopy, 3) X-ray crystallography (Dr.
Blaha, UCR) and 4) denaturation thermal shift measurements. This structure-based design approach used to
derive innovative covalent PIN1 targeting agents that cause degradation of PIN1 in pancreatic cell lines. Guided
by our resources and preliminary data, we propose a collaboration between UCR and CoH to 1) optimize and 2)
develop a potent and selective PIN1 inhibitor for treatment of pancreatic cancer. Aim 1 will design, synthetize,
and iteratively optimize novel, drug-like PIN1 targeting agents. Aim 2 will study the mechanism of action and
efficacy of most promising agents in cellular and animal models of pancreatic cancer. We will assess the
pharmacokinetics properties (Dr. Horne and CoHCCC shared resources) of refined agents in mice and test their
efficacy in animal models of pancreatic cancer (Dr. Horne, Dr. Raoof, CoH) including orthotopic, patient derived
xenografts, and transgenic mouse models of pancreatic cancer."
10767343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Childhood obesity rates have more than tripled over the last 40 years with 18.5% of children and adolescents
who are now obese. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals, particularly obesogens such as polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are contributing to the rapid increases in obesity.
Recent studies indicate that prenatal exposures to PCBs and PFAS contribute to gender-specific obesity
development in children. Both groups of contaminants share a common underlying mechanistic pathway, that
of oxidative stress, and their actions arise from the considerable crosstalk between transcription factors
including nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Others have
found that treating cells in culture directly with PCBs or PFAS [perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)] influences adipogenesis using human and mouse cells. Importantly, PFOS
induced adipogenesis and glucose uptake by acting through Nrf2. Using a mouse model as part of the
previous round of funding, similar observations were made in that offspring exposed perinatally to PCBs had
significantly worse fat and lean mass profiles compared to offspring born to vehicle-treated dams. Further,
mature offspring born to PCB-exposed dams had impaired glucose tolerance compared to offspring from
vehicle-treated dams. Importantly, a healthy behavioral intervention, maternal voluntary exercise during
pregnancy, improved offspring disease risk associated with in utero PCB exposure. The proposed project will
continue to use an in vivo mouse model as well as transition to human samples in order to examine the
molecular impact of environmental contaminant toxicity during a narrow window of susceptibility. Aim 1 will test
whether voluntary exercise during pregnancy or in the offspring themselves can be used as an intervention
strategy to protect against the long-term metabolic detriments associated with in utero PCB exposure. Aim 2
will elucidate the mechanism of impaired glucose tolerance and altered body composition in offspring born to
PCB-exposed dams (including the use of Nrf2 knockout mice), and will determine how maternal exercise is
protecting offspring from these impairments. Aim 3 will use human cells to identify biomarkers of the specific
harm associated with in utero halogenated organic pollutant exposures and to elucidate the potential
mechanisms that contribute to increased obesity and diabetes risk in exposed infants. Our work will measure
actual contaminant exposure levels in maternal and cord serum, and quantify adipocyte differentiation directly
in cells isolated from the same neonates. Anticipated results are particularly significant in that they highlight
early developmental stages as potential periods of particular vulnerability to program lasting obesity and
diabetes effects of toxic environmental insults."
10767345,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chlorinated organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trichloroethylene (TCE, PCE),
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continue to pose both remediation challenges and human health risks.
Despite decades of remediation effort, chloro- and perfluoro-organic compounds remain Superfund pollutants
of national health concern due to their high toxicity, persistence and varied sources of distribution in the
environment. Many current treatments (microbial transformation, carbon adsorption, etc.) for the reclamation of
contaminated water sources are chemical-intensive, energy-intensive, and/or require post-treatment due to
unwanted by-product formation. Project 3 proposes trans-disciplinary integration of the materials surface
science and engineering concepts including responsive polymer and reduced graphene oxide 2D membrane
science, nanostructured metals, and nutrition and food science using approaches common in the biomedical
research field to develop more efficient methods of organic detoxification. The development of nanosized iron-
based materials has brought important and promising techniques into the field of environmental remediation. In
recent years, zero-valent nanoscale metal (especially bimetallic) particles have attracted growing attention in
groundwater remediation of chlorinated solvents. Our overarching goals are to create catalytic domains in
robust polymer hollow fibers and in 2D graphene-based membranes for both reductive and oxidative
degradation and temperature-responsive polymers for PFAS and PCB sorption/ desorption. Two specific aims
are to: 1) to create robust polymeric/gel and 2-D material-based (reduced graphene oxide and composites)
metal catalyzed functionalized membranes and materials to enhance TCE, PCE, PCB degradation efficiency
and reduce material usage, and demonstration of the use of catalytic membrane filters for two site-based
applications, (2) to concentrate and regenerate PFAS and PCB individual compounds using ultra high sorption
capacity temperature responsive hydrogel/membranes or localized heating through AMF (alternating magnetic
field) using magnetite nanoparticles, and to create functionalized smart adsorptive filters and sensors for PFAS
detoxification applications with real-world water samples. Each of these objectives represent highly significant
material science advancement in terms of confined reactive nanosized metals in robust membrane domain,
and novel temperature swing adsorption/desorption through creation of responsive materials. The applications
of our technologies will include collaborations with Rockwell International Site in Russellville, Kentucky for
PCBs and the ATKEMIX TEN Site in Louisville, Kentucky for TCE, PCE, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride
mixture, identified water utilities in Eastern Kentucky for PFAS sorption application, and Arcadis Corporation
involved with remediation activities."
10767347,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of miles of water and sewer piping systems are currently buried across the United States. Near sites
contaminated with hazardous wastes, pipe deterioration provides pathways for contaminant entry and transport
to surrounding communities. One challenge of leaking sewer pipes near Superfund sites involves volatilization
of contaminants that enter subsurface pipes, posing indoor inhalation exposure risks. In drinking water piping
systems, pipe fractures coupled with pressure transients within the piping system allow subsurface
contaminants to enter the system—especially at contaminated sites where such breaks become conduits
impacting water quality. This project provides strategies to reduce and prevent exposure risks to environmental
contaminants, especially chlorinated ethenes and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that result from
leaking and damaged subsurface piping networks. The overarching project goal is to combine piping
infrastructure science with fate and transport science to identify and reduce exposure risks associated with
trichloroethene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE), and PFAS. To achieve this goal, we propose three specific
aims: 1) To measure mass flux of contaminants at field sites where TCE and PCE exposure risks are impacted
by piping networks; evaluate flow and pressure field data from drinking water systems; and, determine the
effect of broken or failed piping components and joints in lab settings 2) To develop models that: a) predict
mass flux of contaminants to indoor air and evaluate exposure risks; b) predict mass flux of contaminants
through piping networks; and, 3) To use stakeholder input and stochastic analyses to characterize model
uncertainty and sensitivity in an effort to develop stakeholder-relevant solutions that reduce and prevent
exposure risks. The specific aims integrate advanced computational modeling approaches with field
measurements collected from piping systems in Eastern Kentucky and at a start-of-the-art vapor intrusion
research facility near a Superfund site. Comparing data from different measurement techniques, including a
novel sensor technology, provides information about temporal variability of sewer gas mass flux which is
critical due to the high level of uncertainty that surrounds environmental exposure risks. The research team
aims to bolster a paradigm shift in the way uncertain exposure risks are managed and develop solutions to
reduce exposure risks in ways that are acceptable to communities. Risk communication science will inform
strategies to evaluate uncertainty using stakeholder perspectives and evidence-based practices as a
framework to promote solution-oriented research and environmental health literacy."
10767984,"ABSTRACT
Iron-deficiency anemia is a common, under-treated problem in pregnancy. The prevalence of iron-deficiency
anemia (anemia plus iron deficiency) is estimated at 16.2% overall in pregnancy and up to 30% at delivery, and
it is associated with significant adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. While treatment with iron supplementation
is recommended during pregnancy, important questions remain about the optimal route of delivery. Oral iron
therapy, the current standard, is often suboptimal: up to 70% of patients experience significant gastrointestinal
side effects that prevent adherence to treatment, resulting in persistent anemia. In addition, the timing and
frequency of oral iron can influence absorption. Intravenous (IV) iron is an attractive alternative because it
mitigates the adherence and absorption challenges of oral iron. However, it costs more, and there are historical
concerns about adverse reactions. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends oral
iron for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy, with IV iron reserved for the “rare patient who
cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron.” Our preliminary data show that this approach leads to 30% of patients
with persistent IDA at delivery and an associated 3 to 6-fold increased risk of peripartum blood transfusion, a
metric within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s severe maternal morbidity composite. This
preferential recommendation of oral iron is based on paucity of data on the benefits and safety of IV iron,
compared with oral iron, in pregnancy. Our published systematic review and meta-analysis showed that IV iron
is associated with greater increase in maternal hemoglobin (Hb), but most of the primary trials were conducted
in developing countries, included small sample sizes (50 – 252), and did not assess meaningful maternal and
neonatal outcomes. The current Cochrane review noted that despite the high incidence and disease burden
associated with IDA in pregnancy, there is paucity of quality trials assessing clinical maternal and neonatal effects
of iron administration in women with anemia. The authors called for “large, good quality trials assessing clinical
outcomes.” The only large randomized trial of IV versus oral iron, conducted in India, showed no difference in a
maternal composite outcome but is limited by use of iron sucrose with a wide range of iron doses (200 – 1600
mg) in up to 5 infusions. In addition, the primary composite outcome included components not directly related to
anemia. In contrast, our pilot trial of a single infusion of 1000 mg of IV low molecular weight dextran in pregnant
women in the U.S. with moderate-to-severe IDA significantly reduced the rate of maternal anemia at delivery
and showed promise for reducing rates of blood transfusion. We propose the first definitive double blind, placebo
controlled, multicenter randomized trial in pregnant women in the U.S. (N=746) to test the central hypothesis
that IV iron in pregnant women with moderate-to-severe IDA (Hb<10 g/dL and ferritin<30 ng/mL) at 24 – 28
weeks will be effective, safe and cost-effective in reducing peripartum blood transfusion and improve offspring
neurodevelopment. A multidisciplinary team of investigators in the U.S., will pursue the following specific aims:
1) Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IV iron, compared with oral iron, in reducing the rate of peripartum
blood transfusion in pregnant women with moderate-to-severe IDA. (Primary Aim); 2) Estimate the cost-
effectiveness of IV iron, compared with oral iron, in pregnant women with moderate-to-severe IDA as measured
by incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life-year (QALY). (Secondary Aim 1); and 3) Assess the effect of IV
iron, compared with oral iron, on offspring brain myelin content and neurodevelopment. (Secondary Aim 2)."
10767986,"Project Summary
Chronological age is the leading risk factor for most chronic diseases, frailty, and mortality worldwide. Thus, the
elderly population usually has multiple chronic conditions at the same time, resulting in poor health and reduced
quality of life (prolonged morbidity period) at the later stage of life. There is a big challenge to compress morbidity
period and increase healthspan (lifespan with good health). In this project, we propose to examine the role of
p21high senescent cells in lifespan and healthspan. We have generated and validated a new p21-Cre transgenic
mouse model containing a p21 promoter driving a bicistronic message consisting of Cre fused to a tamoxifen-
inducible estrogen receptor (ER) element. This model enables us to monitor, sort, kill or modulate p21high cells
with aging in vivo. Our preliminary data shows that p21high and p16high cells are two distinct cell populations, and
the p21-Cre mouse model targets 1.5-10% of cells in various tissues in 23-month-old mice. Monthly clearance
of p21high cells in mice starting at 20 months reduces frailty index, extends lifespan, and more importantly,
improves physical function at the end of life. In this proposal, we will further characterize the role and mechanisms
of p21high cells in lifespan and healthspan. Our overarching hypothesis is that targeting p21high cells can extend
lifespan and compress morbidity in old age. In aim 1.1, we will investigate whether clearance of p21high cells
could extend lifespan and healthspan using a larger group size. We will examine potential sex difference and
perform postmortem pathological analysis to examine the cause of death and disease burden. Moreover, we will
follow physical function and frailty index of these mice every month from 20-month-old to the end of life to assess
late life health status. In aim 1.2, we will leverage p21-Cre mouse models to sort and enrich p21high cells from 6
tissues of 23-month-old mice where we observed p21high cells (2-10%), and perform single cell RNA sequencing
on these cells along with non-p21high cells. In addition, we will perform single nucleus sequencing and imaging
mass cytometry. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of NF-κB pathway in p21high cells in lifespan and healthspan
shortening. This project is likely to have a broad impact on aging research by gaining a comprehensive
understanding of p21high cells at both functional and transcriptomic levels in vivo. Results from this project will
also enable future testing of pharmacological interventions that eliminate these cells to improve lifespan and
compress morbidity."

successful T32 postdoctoral training program in anesthesiology and perioperative medicine research training at
the University of Washington. Our primary objective is to provide in-depth research training at the postdoctoral
level in cutting edge (and emerging) areas of biomedical science related to anesthesiology and perioperative
medicine. Prior and current trainees have demonstrated success in this program, producing numerous peer-

and clinical departments (e.g., Pharmacology, Genetics, Pediatrics, Psychiatry). Research opportunities are
offered by 26 NIH-funded faculty mentors with proven records of success in the training of postdoctoral fellows,
with diverse research programs ranging from laboratory-based science to translational, clinical, and health
services research. Core faculty research leaders will help match trainees to mentors within five major research
areas relevant to anesthesiology and perioperative medicine including (alphabetically): 1) cardiovascular and
mitochondrial biology, 2) clinical outcomes research & epidemiology, 3) genome sciences, 4) neurosciences,
and 5) pain. Aims of the program are: to recruit outstanding diverse postdoctoral trainees from a national
applicant pool; provide trainees with interdisciplinary theories and methods pertinent to their research area;
provide trainees with the practical skills to design and conduct high quality research in anesthesiology and
perioperative medicine (including fundamental research skills, understanding responsible conduct of research
and rigor and reproducibility, ability to disseminate research findings, and acquire successful grantsmanship
skills and independent funding); and to create a supportive environment through strong mentorship, a breadth
of research opportunities, and collaboration across departments. We offer a robust didactic program to provide

10770473,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as the sudden, unexpected, and unexplained
death of a person with epilepsy. SUDEP accounts for between 8 and 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths, rising
to 50% in patients for which current therapies are ineffective. Amongst all neurological conditions, it is second
only to stroke for number of life-years lost. Increasing evidence supports apnea (breathing cessation) as the
primary cause of death following a seizure. Apnea and oxygen desaturation have been reported in a large
percentage of patients during and after convulsive seizures, and of the 9 SUDEP cases that were monitored by
video-EEG in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) at the time of death, all involved respiratory arrest occurring
before terminal asystole (MORTEMUS study). A better understanding of the key processes involved in
respiratory dysfunction and subsequent SUDEP would allow for the development of novel rescue therapies.
 SUDEP occurs across numerous epilepsy populations. One such vulnerable population are patients with
SCN8A epileptic encephalopathy (EE), who have a gain of function mutation in the NaV1.6 sodium channel.
Our mice models harbor Scn8a mutations identified in patients that suffered SUDEP, and produce many of the
clinical symptoms of the patients, including spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures, apnea, and
SUDEP. Using these clinically relevant mice models we will test our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that SUDEP
occurs when breathing ceases after a seizure, as a result of constant tonic inspiratory activity, and
failure of breathing recovery is due to impaired cardiorespiratory homeostasis. AIM 1: We will determine
the role of the Bötzinger complex (BötC) and retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) brainstem neurons on coordinating
inspiratory activity during seizure-induced apnea using optogenetic techniques. AIM 2: Epilepsy patients at risk
for SUDEP have impaired central chemosensitivity. We show that our SCN8A EE mice also have impaired
central chemosensitivity. We propose to assess in vivo CO2-sensitivity at developmental time points leading up
to SUDEP and determine if inhibition of sodium channel (INa) currents can rescue CO2-sensitivity. We will
determine changes in RTN neurons to determine their CO2/H+-sensitivity, intrinsic excitability, and INa currents.
Finally, we will use shRNA to knockdown NaV1.6 in the RTN and assess its contribution to in vivo CO2-
sensitivity and SUDEP. AIM 3: Impaired cardiac control is a contributor of SUDEP, and we find that
bradycardia occurs immediately prior to SUDEP. We will determine in vivo parasympathetic cardiac drive
leading up to SUDEP and determine effects of INa inhibition. We will make recordings from parasympathetic
cardiovagal neurons and determine the effects of NaV1.6 knockdown on bradycardia and SUDEP. These
studies will significantly impact our current understanding of the cardiorespiratory alterations that lead to
SUDEP and could provide important insight into novel therapeutic targets to prevent SUDEP."
10987081,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as the sudden, unexpected, and unexplained
death of a person with epilepsy. SUDEP accounts for between 8 and 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths, rising
to 50% in patients for which current therapies are ineffective. Amongst all neurological conditions, it is second
only to stroke for number of life-years lost. Increasing evidence supports apnea (breathing cessation) as the
primary cause of death following a seizure. Apnea and oxygen desaturation have been reported in a large

 African descent men (ADM) across the African diaspora have the highest rates of prostate cancer (CaP) of
any racial or ethnic group. The incidence rate in African American men (AAM) is 71% higher than in European
American men (EAM) and the AAM mortality rate is 210% higher than EAM. Despite the public health implications
of these observations, the underlying causes of this disparity remain unresolved.
 There is substantial evidence that social inequities and access to health care are in part responsible for CaP
disparities. There is limited consistent evidence for exposures and environmental factors in CaP etiology or
progression. In contrast, CaP is strongly influenced by inherited genetic variation, and there is growing evidence
that the mutational landscape of prostate tumors varies substantially by race. These observations suggest that
biological factors influence CaP incidence and tumor aggressiveness differentially by race and may in part
explain CaP disparities by race.
 To inform the biological basis of CaP disparities that adversely affect ADM, we have developed a large,
multicenter consortium known as “Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate” (MADCaP). Using the
resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a study of CaP in ADM to address the following Aims:
Aim 1: Identify common genetic variants associated with CaP aggressiveness in ADM; Aim 2: Define
histopathological commonalities of prostate tumors in ADM; and Aim 3: Evaluate molecular signatures and
subtypes in prostate tumors and determine their relationship to pathological and clinical characteristics in ADM.
 The proposed research will have innovative impact in a number of ways. We will address the critical need
for increased ethnic diversity in cancer genomics data, which to date has been dominated by studies in European
ancestral populations. Ethnically diverse genetic data will not only improve our understanding of genomic
contributors to cancer etiology and disparities but will also aid in the development and implementation of cancer
genomic analysis for all populations, reduce the potential for errors in determining pathogenicity of genetic
susceptibility variants, and improve interpretation of cancer risk in all populations including AAM. In undertaking
this research, we will enhance infrastructure needed to undertake genomics research in Africa that includes a
large, well-annotated sample of systematically collected tumors with clinical and epidemiologic data that can be
used to address a variety of research and clinical questions. We have constructed the MADCaP resources to
integrate directly with existing publicly available databases, such as TCGA/ICGC and GENIE, to ensure the
African data can be readily compared with data from other sources. Our data will also include deep pathology,
clinical and risk factor annotation, largely unavailable in current public datasets, to provide a fuller potential to
understand underlying disparities in CaP etiology."

 The proposal entitled “Summer Research Fellowship Program for Podiatric Medical Students” is a short-term
training grant involving pre-doctoral podiatric medical students in biomedical research. An estimated 37.3 million
Americans (11.3% of the population) have diabetes, a serious, life-long condition. Foot pathology is one of the
most common complications associated with diabetes and podiatrists are often the first-in-line clinicians seen by
patients with diabetes. As it is a relatively young discipline, podiatry has not developed institutionalized research
in most of its schools and training institutions. Subsequently, podiatric medical students are traditionally under-
represented in research careers but provide a large pool of available talent that could be recruited in biomedical
science research. This is especially true in the field of diabetes. The Summer Research Fellowship Program
exposes first-year podiatric medical student to interprofessional research across numerous disciplines and is
often their first exposure to biomedical research. The program also provides an inclusive professional community
where students can develop the skills and mentorship required for research success. The overall goal of the
training program is to increase the number of podiatric medical students entering careers in the biomedical
sciences. We seek to achieve this goal by pursuing the following aims/objectives:
 1. Provide podiatric students with individual hands-on experiences in scientific research through
 mentorship from an active researcher and/or joining an existing research center at RFUMS.
 2. Provide a collaborative research environment that combines experts in basic science, clinical, and
 translational research, in order to optimally address individual student interests.
 3. Provide podiatric students with an ongoing research support network and opportunity to maintain
 involvement in research over the course of their academic medical career.
 4. Provide podiatric students with educational training in data collection and analysis, scientific writing, and
 oral presentation of research, and responsible conduct in research.
 5. Provide podiatric students with opportunities to explore career options in medical research through
 interactions with mentors, other faculty, and prior trainees.
 6. Foster a sense of belonging to a community of like-minded scientists among the trainees
After completion of the summer research program, podiatric medical student have opportunities to continue their
work in one of several interprofessional programs offered by the college including the dual DPM-PhD degree
program."

The broad, long-term objectives of the Fostering Underrepresented Employees’ Resilience and Zeal for Aca-
demia (FUERZA) project are three-fold. The first is to enhance diversity in NIDCD’s extramural workforce by
creating a mentoring network that allows for recruitment and retention of junior- to mid-career scholars from
historically-excluded backgrounds. Our first aim is to recruit, hire, and retain at least five new faculty
members from historically-excluded groups and to create a specific mentoring plan that will enhance
their productivity and success. This number is equivalent to one third of our tenure track faculty, thus having
the potential to substantially change our demographics. Our methods for this aim include incorporating best
practices into hiring and advertising for positions, hiring in clusters to foster a sense of community, and using
recruitment tools like the FUERZA plan itself, to attract the best scientists to our institution. We will provide
FUERZA members with evidence-based mentoring, community building, access to professional resources, and
commitments specific to underrepresented faculty (e.g., avoiding cultural taxation, resources to grow the pipe-
line). Our second aim is to improve the mentoring skills of existing faculty members and improve the
departmental culture in terms of both attitudes and policies so that faculty from historically-excluded
backgrounds will feel welcome and supported within the community. This aim will be approached through
internal and external trainings on cultural competence/humility and mentoring across differences. It will also
center on ensuring we have clarity of communications – ensuring that all policies and procedures are accessi-
ble and equitable. Our third aim is to hire and mentor ten undergraduate students from historically-ex-
cluded backgrounds per year. With this multi-faceted approach, not only will we increase the number of re-
searchers from historically-excluded backgrounds, but we will have created an environment that is inclusive
and leads to retention and job satisfaction. With a network like this in place, we will be able to recruit and en-
hance the experiences of faculty and students from historically-excluded backgrounds as well, making a sus-
tainable, diverse, research pipeline. This is essential, as people who are doing research that affects health
care intervention (as our field does) cannot do the best work if they do not understand and reflect the commu-
nities that they serve. Currently, our field is not diverse, and this needs to change if we are to do the best sci-
ence and serve our nation appropriately. To ensure that all aims are met, and met in a culturally responsive
way, we will engage an Advisory Committee of outstanding scientists who are from historically-excluded back-
grounds. They will be brought into all decision-making processes to ensure that the choices that are made al-
ways include the viewpoints and expertise of people from underrepresented backgrounds. Moving forward, this
plan should allow all faculty in our department to better support junior scholars from historically excluded
groups, mentor diverse students, and improve our science."

Retained Foreign Objects (RFOs) are one of the most well recognized and persistent patient safety problems,
affecting between 3000 and 50,000 patients per year, with an 80% morbidity rate, The primary defense is the
manual counting of items that enter and leave the surgical field (the “surgical count”), which can be unreliable,
while technologies, policies and training still leave many potential opportunities for failure. We propose a Patient
Safety Learning Lab that will explore the causes of and solutions to RFOs using a systems engineering approach.
Our initial systems models will drive improved understanding of factors that influence successful and
unsuccessful counting. Laboratory experiments in count grouping, including time pressures, distractors, and the
role of technology will define and build an evidence for optimal count strategies. It will also be possible to identify
multiple opportunities to enhance the perioperative count process prior to the commencement of the procedure;
and the discovery of lost items in the case of a discrepant count. Finally, as RFO performance is affected by
organizational work contexts, we will explore opportunities to enhance teamwork, and organizational learning
processes post-event. This work will initiate the most fundamental reappraisal of the causes of and solutions to
RFOs for more than 20 years."

Conjunctivitis, a common ocular condition with a range of etiologies, is highly prevalent, affecting
approximately 6 million people annually in the United States, accounting for 1% of all primary care office
visits, and costing 430 million USD annually. Viruses are responsible for ~ 80% of conjunctivitis cases,
and human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are implicated in up to 65%. A particularly severe variant of
adenoviral conjunctivitis, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is caused principally by viruses within
human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), for example the highly virulent adenovirus type 37. The clinical
manifestations of EKC include severe membranous conjunctivitis and epithelial keratitis, followed by
delayed onset of multifocal subepithelial (stromal) corneal infiltrates that cause light sensitivity and
reduced vision and can persist or recur for months to years after the acute infection. We have shown
previously that acute HAdV-D infection of human keratocytes induces intracellular signaling and robust
expression of neutrophil and monocyte chemokines, and that physical components of the adenovirus
(viral capsid and DNA) initiate molecular pattern responses in the corneal stroma. However, why
adenovirus keratitis can be chronic and recurrent when the infection has resolved and the adenovirus
is no longer present has not been previously studied. The specific aims of this proposal are to test the
hypotheses that 1) the post EKC cornea expresses a unique array of pro-inflammatory mediators, 2)
the post EKC cornea retains innate immune cells with a chronically altered transcriptome, and 3) long-
lasting pro-inflammatory changes in the post EKC cornea can be mitigated by epigenetic modifying
agents. We will study the cornea in our adenovirus mouse keratitis model after resolution of the
infection, using protein arrays and immuno-microscopy to elucidate the pro-inflammatory mediators
responsible for chronic adenovirus keratitis, flow cytometry and single cell RNA-seq to determine
infiltrating cellular phenotypes and individual cell type transcriptomes, and single cell ATAC-seq to
determine changes in cellular chromatin of resident keratocytes and infiltrating cells. Finally, we will
apply known modifying agents of cellular chromatin in an attempt to prevent, reduce, or reverse pro-
inflammatory mediator expression and pathologic innate immune cell phenotypes in chronic adenovirus
keratitis. These studies are designed to take us closer to our goal of effective information-based
therapies against HAdV eye infections. EKC is a common affliction, and the proposed study addresses
a major public health concern."

The ability to learn from experience is one of the most fundamental features of neural circuits. Changes in
synaptic connections in specific circuits underlie experience-dependent circuit modifications essential for
learning. A detailed understanding of this process is important, not just to understand the mechanisms of
learning, but also to better diagnose and treat conditions that affect memory abilities, such as Alzheimer's
disease, aging-related dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Our ultimate goal is to understand the precise, fine-
scale circuit modifications that support learning.
 One of the fundamental forms of learning is motor learning in which animals adjust the way they move
their bodies to fit their behavioral goals. Among a number of brain areas involved in motor learning, the primary
motor cortex (M1) is a major locus where changes take place during motor learning. Many types of changes in
M1 have been described that accompany motor learning, including changes of the somatotopic map, neural
population activity changes, and synaptic plasticity. However, it is unclear whether M1 is always involved in the
control of movements throughout learning and overtraining. Furthermore, the precise functional reorganization
of synaptic inputs in M1 during motor learning is only beginning to be understood. We will address these two
questions using cutting-edge technologies in mice. Mice under head-fixation will be trained in a forelimb-based
motor learning task daily over weeks. In Aim 1, we will perform longitudinal recording of M1 neural populations
during months of motor learning and overtraining. Combined with optogenetic perturbation of M1 activity at
various phases of training, we test the hypothesis that a movement that is dependent on M1 early in learning
can become M1-independent with long-term overtraining. This will also define the period during which the
particular motor task we use in the proposal depends critically on M1. Focusing on this period when M1 is
critical for motor performance, we will study precise functional reorganization of synapses in M1. We will do
this using longitudinal functional imaging at synaptic resolution. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that
motor learning induces functional clustering of synaptic inputs related to the learned movements. Such
functional clustering would allow the learning-related information to robustly drive circuit activation. These
experiments will contribute fundamental neural circuit mechanisms underlying motor learning. Such knowledge
could ultimately contribute to a better diagnosis and treatment of motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease
and stroke."

We propose a new T32 program to train post-doctoral scientists in classical hematology, transfusion medicine,
and glycobiology research at the Versiti Blood Research Institute (VBRI). As intimately linked disciplines,
classical hematology and transfusion medicine form a cornerstone of research in blood diseases but need help
attracting new talent. While founded in hematology, glycobiology remains a specialized research domain with
few experts to translate basic findings into clinical practice. The VBRI, enhanced by selected faculty from the
Medical College of Wisconsin, is home to a unique cluster of experts in these areas who will serve as
preceptors in this T32 program to close the substantial gap in this required workforce. Trainees for this
program will be accepted into one of two training tracks; Thrombosis, Hemostasis, and Vascular Biology (Track
I); and Glycobiology in Hematology, Transfusion Medicine, and Metabolism (Track II). Trainees will gain an in-
depth scientific understanding of their field, acquire competency in pertinent research technologies, and learn
to conduct and present independent research, including the skills needed to fund, manage, and sustain a
laboratory. Trainees will undergo a rigorous selection process by an internal Executive Committee,
emphasizing recruiting and retaining trainees from underrepresented minority groups. Selected trainees will
participate in a research-intensive program based on an individual development plan (IDP)-driven format with a
mentored research project at its core. In addition to their basic science preceptor, each trainee will have a
clinical co-mentor to learn about translational and clinical aspects of their research. We will implement bench
science and supplement it with a didactic lecture module designed for each training track, a focused
technology workshop, regular weekly scientific conferences, and participation in national meetings. Each
trainee will receive group mentoring from a Scholarship Oversight Committee, consisting of the trainee's
mentor, one program Co-Director, and one member of the Executive Committee, who will establish the IDP,
ensure project completion and activity progress, and provide regular feedback to the Co-Directors. Preceptors
will be required to undergo mentor-the-mentor training. The Executive Committee (co-Directors Drs. Mast,
Hoffmeister, and preceptor faculty Drs. Kastrup, Ma, and Dahms) will meet bi-annually to 1) prioritize program
goals, 2) oversee program policies, activities, and governance practices to provide program oversight. An
External Advisory Board will meet annually with program administration and trainees to provide feedback. We
request support for three post-doctoral fellows to appoint one annually over the first three years. Thus, we plan
for a small but highly effective program where initial trainees set a high standard for those following. As such,
we expect the trainees to pursue mentored research awards from the NIH or other funding agencies as their
careers progress from post-doctoral fellows to junior faculty and independent research careers, strengthening
and expanding the US scientific workforce in classical hematology, transfusion medicine, and glycobiology."

The Oncology-focused Postdoctoral Training In Care Delivery and Symptom Science (OPTICS) T32 program
will mentor and train physicians and scientists with PhDs in social or quantitative sciences to conduct research
focused on innovative cancer care delivery that narrows the gap between outcomes that are possible based on
contemporary scientific understanding of cancer prevention and treatment and outcomes that are actually
achieved. This persistent gap results in a critical need for translational researchers who are focused on risk
reduction, symptom science, and innovative care delivery and have rigorous training in research methods
required for care delivery transformation and leadership of health system–level interventions to reduce
pervasive inequities in treatment outcomes. The cornerstone of the OPTICS program will be a 2-year mentored
research experience in which trainees will conduct research aligned with one or more of four thematic areas: 1)
Data Science, 2) Risk Mitigation, 3) Symptom Science, and 4) Care Delivery. An emphasis on remediation of
inequities generated by structural racism and classism is a core program tenet. OPTICS trainees will receive 1)
intensive mentorship and the resources necessary to execute a focused research project in one or more of the
thematic areas; 2) training in core methods necessary for impactful research through coursework, seminars,
workshops, and reading groups; and 3) training in skills required for career building, including protocol
development and execution, management, grant writing, team building, patient engagement, dry-laboratory
organization, and the responsible conduct of research. OPTICS will be co-led by 2 PhDs and 2 MDs at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) with long track records of impactful research, mentorship, and
successful knowledge translation. This structure will attract diverse candidates and afford participants methods
training and the ability to launch interventions in the community and the clinic. OPTICS will train 6 postdoctoral
fellows each year (3 new appointees and 3 re-appointees) with a team of 36 core program faculty, 10 emerging
mentors, and 6 research supporters with relevant supporting skills, expertise, and resources. Required core
program training at the New York City campus of MSK and its partner Weill Cornell Medical College is
supplemented by an array of elective learning opportunities customized to each trainee's needs and learning
style. Trainees will obtain the skills necessary to develop, test, and implement new approaches to optimizing
patients' experiences by focusing on risk reduction, symptom control, communication, and new models of
cancer care delivery. These skills are crucial to address the challenges brought about by the tremendous
growth in the complexity and chronicity of cancer care. OPTICS aims to prepare trainees for impactful careers
focused on innovations to optimize cancer care quality, equity, and translation of knowledge to ensure that
discoveries made in the laboratory and clinic realize their full impact on population health and well-being."

Health Related Social Needs (HRSN), such as food insecurity, housing quality, and access to transportation,
are key drivers of persistent and increasing health disparities. Unmet HSRN are disproportionately prevalent in
immigrant communities compared to U.S. born counterparts. Hispanic/Latinx families experience twice the rate
of food insecurity than non-Hispanic/Latinx families with higher rates among immigrant Latinx populations.
Despite the existence of evidence-based interventions to address food insecurity, health disparity populations
have often not benefited from such interventions because either necessary adaptations have not occurred or
have not been well-documented or evaluated. This career development award leverages an existing clinic-
community collaboration, the Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, to develop an implementation strategy to
increase enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps)
among a multicultural Latinx immigrant community. SNAP enrollment will serve as a prototype evidence-based
intervention to identify core community-driven strategies that can be used to adapt and implement additional
evidence-based social interventions. This proposal uses robust community-engaged research and
implementation science methods to identify and leverage community strengths to increase SNAP enrollment
and expand the science of implementing evidence-based interventions in diverse communities. To do so, Dr.
Byhoff proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative
research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) to conduct a formative evaluation to understand
stakeholder perceptions of food access, food programming, and SNAP utilization in a multicultural Latinx
immigrant community; 2) to develop an implementation strategy using the Practical Robust Implementation and
Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework and community engaged research methods to increase SNAP
enrollment; and 3) Pilot a SNAP enrollment strategy and identify the essential components for a successful
social intervention implementation among a multicultural Latinx immigrant community. In addition to advanced
training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary
mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in health disparities research, community-
engaged research methods, and implementation science. The combination of formal training and mentored
research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Byhoff will emerge from this award as an
independent health disparities investigator with expertise in community-engaged research and implementation
science methods."

The goal of the 4T study is to implement proven methods and emerging diabetes technology into our clinical
practice to sustain tight glucose control from the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and optimize patient reported
and psychosocial outcomes. We will define a program (4T---Teamwork, Targets, Technology and Tight
Control) translatable to Pediatric Diabetes clinics in the United States that reduces HbA1c and T1D burden and
improves patient well-being.
In response to the R18 mechanism, we have designed a pragmatic approach to study a re-designed diabetes
education and care delivery program in newly diagnosed Pediatric T1D patients. The primary outcome will be
to implement 4T education and care in newly diagnosed T1D patients to reduce the rise in HbA1c observed 6
months post-diagnosis. We will compare results to historic data from our clinic and to contemporaneous new
onset HbA1c data in the USA and internationally. Our secondary aims are to refine a systematic, pragmatic
approach to monitoring longitudinal Patient Reported Outcomes and Psychosocial Outcomes and to develop
and test in a randomized trial an automated system to detect the need for insulin dose adjustment in between
quarterly visits. We will do so by using glucose data to generate personalized management recommendations
based on each patient’s physiological and psychosocial data.
The research outlined in this proposal aims to lower HbA1c, develop glucose data management and
communication systems and support the psychosocial challenges of T1D in a program that is practical,
sustainable, and translatable to other Pediatric Diabetes clinics in the US. Specific innovations will be to
develop: 1) best practices for providers & T1D patients for glucose and psychosocial outcomes; 2) systems to
identify patients with changing insulin needs based on glucose data obtained in between visits; 3) integration of
these glucose data into EMR to incorporate into routine clinical practice.
In sum, we propose leveraging existing staff and resources to test an innovative approach to improve T1D
treatment in our clinic with the goal of obtaining results that will improve healthcare practice and inform
healthcare policy for T1D management. We will assess factors that inform sustainability, acceptability, and
feasibility. By design, the approach being tested is practical and sustainable with the potential to be broadly
disseminated across the US and to improve processes of care and health outcomes for the Pediatric T1D
population."
10773634,"Functional dyspepsia and chronic nausea and vomiting syndromes affect >10% of the population, inducing a
vast burden of ill-health and economic harm. Yet despite their enormous impact, these diseases remain poorly
understood, with few objective diagnostic tests available to subtype patients and direct therapies. There is a
pressing need for new mechanistic insights and diagnostic solutions that can better characterize these
common and burdensome disorders. In this proposal, we translate and apply a new diagnostic approach with
outstanding potential to define mechanims of gastric dysfunction - ‘Body Surface Gastric Mapping (BSGM)’.
BSGM has been pioneered by our team, and represents the first accurate non-invasive tool for detecting and
mapping spatial patterns of gastric electrical activity. In this project, we will apply BSGM to definitively resolve
whether gastric dysrhythmias are an important mechanism of gastric dysfunction. Although this hypothesis is
longstanding, it has never been adequately investigated because past clinical methods (electrogastrography;
EGG) were inaccurate due to their technical limitations and their focus on frequency. Our preliminary BSGM
data is revealing new sensitive and specific spatial biomarkers of gastric dysfunction, which correlate well with
symptoms, and which were not addressable using previous EGG metrics such as frequency.
Several innovations have converged to now enable the translation of BSGM in large clinical studies: flexible
arrays of 8x8 cutaneous electrodes, a custom-built multichannel data-logger, a symptom-tracking App coupled
to the data-logger by Bluetooth, and a sophisticated analysis pipeline to accurately map the retrieved signals.
These BSGM innovations will be applied to definitively evaluate the clinical significance of gastric dysrhythmias
with reference to an expert consensus guideline: ‘Plausibility Criteria for Putative Mechanisms of GI Functional
Disorders’. This guideline identifies 5 specific criteria that must be met to validate new functional disorder
mechanisms, and these criteria therefore also define our 5 Specific Aims: 1. Defining the presence of gastric
dysrhythmia in a subset of patients with symptoms of gastric dysfunction; ii) Defining a temporal association
between gastric dysrhythmia and symptoms; iii) Correlation with symptom severity; iv) Induction of gastric
dysrhythmia with symptom onset in healthy controls; and v) A congruent natural history. These aims will be
addressed by building and applying BSGM devices in non-invasive studies of 400 patients and 200 controls.
The studies will be performed at two leading US motility centers of excellence, backed by an interdisciplinary
team of clinicians and bioengineers who share an outstanding track record for innovation and translation.
This project is anticipated to yield 3 high-impact outcomes, each of which would be a breakthrough advance in
the GI motility field: i) A definitive answer to the longstanding question of whether gastric dysrhythmias are
clinically important; ii) Presenting BSGM as a new clinical diagnostic tool for gastric dysfunction; and iii)
Validation of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets through BSGM to guide future interventions."
10773735,"Abstract
Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their
axons. Damage from glaucoma is permanent and may cause irreversible blindness. Glaucoma is a major
public health problem in the United States and worldwide, where it is the leading cause of irreversible
blindness. Four classic risk factors have been identified for the most common type of glaucoma, primary open
angle glaucoma (POAG): increasing age, race / ethnicity, family history, and increased intraocular pressure
(IOP). Currently, all treatments for glaucoma slow or halt disease by targeting one risk factor, increased IOP.
However, IOP-lowering therapies fail to prevent vision loss in many patients. Thus, glaucoma patients
desperately need new, more effective therapies that target other aspects of glaucoma beyond elevated IOP,
such as the mechanisms underlying family history of glaucoma. Unfortunately, most genetic risk associated
with glaucoma remains poorly understood. Most cases of POAG have a complex genetic basis and involve
many risk factors. To date, >127 risk factor loci have been identified with genome-wide association studies
(GWAS's). In each of these loci, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with
risk for POAG and the effect of these SNPs on the nearest gene has been presumed to be the source of risk.
However, little progress has been made in precisely defining these loci, including the causative SNP(s),
gene(s), or mechanism(s). Very few of the disease-associated SNPs the >127 glaucoma risk loci are in coding
sequence. Consequently, we hypothesize that the functional SNPs in each locus confer glaucoma risk by
increasing or decreasing transcript levels of effector genes in the locus. To test our hypothesis, we have
prioritized three loci for detailed studies (chr 4p14, chr 21q21.3, and chr 17q21.3), which each containing an
exemplar candidate for being the effector gene (APBB2, APP, MAPT), which are all expressed in RGCs and all
share links with neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer disease. To test whether these are indeed the
effectors and study their mechanisms, we propose a complementary set of experiments using human, mouse,
and molecular approaches. In Specific Aim 1 we will use genotyped human donor retinal tissue to identify how
transcript and protein levels for the exemplar candidates are altered in association with the high-risk allele at
each locus (using scRNAseq, IHC, and ELISA), as well as assess other transcriptomic changes across the
locus (and genome). We will also use BiT-STARR-seq, to identify SNPs in each locus capable of changing

exemplar candidate genes and study how dysregulation of these genes influences RGC health. With
completion of these experiments, we will advance understanding the basic biology of glaucoma risk factors

familial glaucoma risk, which are key to the development of new sight-saving therapies."

Obesity-induced liver injury is a significant health concern. In obesity, levels of circulating free fatty acids increase, which are taken up by the liver. Moreover, obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia causes pathway-selective insulin resistance, leading to reduced glucose uptake and increased gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in the liver. Chronic alterations of these pathways contribute to lipotoxic stress, steatohepatitis, and hepatocellular injury. The resulting accumulation of excess fatty acids and cholesterol as lipid-droplets in hepatocytes is termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). With the progression of obesity, the injury and the associated activated macrophages together stimulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into a fibrogenic phenotype, observed in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained fibrogenesis can progress to cirrhosis, and a subset of cirrhosis patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Although no FDA-approved drugs are available to treat NASH yet, pathways that reduce body fat, insulin resistance, inflammation and fibrosis are being targeted. Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase-1 (IP6K1) generates the signaling inositol pyrophosphate molecule, 5-InsP7, which is a critical regulator of diverse metabolic functions including insulin secretion and signaling and energy metabolism. Our published studies demonstrated that IP6K1 promotes development and progression of obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD/NASH. Furthermore, hepatic IP6K1 expression directly correlates with NASH and cirrhosis in humans. These data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of IP6K1 could be a novel strategy to treat NAFLD/NASH.
Here, we propose to utilize a well-established and productive team of researchers along with ligand-based drug design and enzymatic and cell-based assays to develop novel and potent IP6K1 inhibitors and validate their biochemical and functional activities in a mouse model of NAFLD/NASH. At the completion of this work, we expect to deliver a selective and orally available IP6K1 inhibitor suitable for in vivo efficacy studies and a viable method for large-scale synthesis of the compound."

There are currently more than 280 genes in which defects are known to cause retinal
degeneration. Thus, there is a critical need to develop broad spectrum approaches to treating
these diseases. The hypothesis of this proposal is that if we can selectively increase glycolysis in
rod and cone photoreceptors, then this increase in metabolic potential should slow retinal
degeneration across a broad spectrum of etiologies. Our findings strongly support the idea that
we can specifically modify arrestin1 such that the catalytic rate of enolase1 in glycolysis is
selectively increased in rods and cones. Significantly, this increase in glycolysis slows the loss of
photoreceptors and improves photoreceptor function in at least one animal model of retinal
degeneration. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are to determine the mechanistic
properties of ArrGG’s effect, examining metabolites and gene expression profiles of treated
animals (Aim1). We will then establish ArrGG as a gene-agnostic approach to slowing retinal
degeneration, testing the therapeutic benefit of ArrGG in diverse models of inherited retinal
degeneration (Aim 2)."

 Cardiomyocyte mitochondria generate ATP that fuels contraction and normal or reparative
cardiomyocyte growth. The preferred metabolic substrates of cardiomyocyte mitochondria evolve
during cardiac development from a fetal preference for carbohydrates to the normal adult preference
for fatty acids, with reversion to fetal-like utilization of carbohydrates in adult cardiomyopathy. Much as
gasoline and electric versions of the same automobile are not interconvertible by software
“reprogramming”, we discovered that myocardial metabolic transitions require mitophagic elimination
and biogenic replacement of carbohydrate-processing by fatty acid-processing mitochondria. We
identified mitofusin (MFN) 2, which in other tissues is a mitochondrial fusion protein, as the key nodal
regulator of mitophagic mitochondrial replacement in perinatal myocardial mitochondria, i.e. the hub of
a mitochondrial dynamics-mitophagy interactome. However, our understanding of specific
mechanisms that direct cardiac substrate utilization in adult hearts is incomplete, and forced biogenic
production of cardiomyocyte mitochondria has not proven therapeutic in experimental models of heart
disease.
 Although there is much work to be done before our findings can be translated into effective
treatments for human heart disease, our research over the past several years has engendered a solid
foundation for this goal. The conceptual breakthrough for this research was our discovery that
MFN2 orchestration of mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy is the consequence of different MFN2
protein pairing events directed by specific PINK1-kinase phosphorylation events. A consequence of
this mechanism is that mitochondrial fusion (MFN-MFN pairing) and mitophagy (MFN-Parkin pairing)
are mutually exclusive. The biophysical process linking MFN2 phosphorylation to differential protein
pairing is MFN2 conformational switching from a closed state favoring mitophagy to an open state
favoring mitochondrial fusion. Research products generated from this work include the first mitofusin
activating small molecules and an expanding catalog of MFN2 mutants available in adenoviral vectors
and knock-in mice. Translationally, our work is beginning to identify clinical applications for
pharmacological mitofusin activation.
Here, we propose to translate what we have learned in basic mechanistic studies of mitochondrial
dynamics factors to a preclinical delineation of disease mechanisms and evaluation of potential
therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we propose two goals: A basic research goal to determine how
MFN2 multifunctionality relates to differential protein-partnering evoked by phosphorylation-induced
changes in MFN2 conformation that expose or hide specific MFN2 protein binding domains. We posit
that the unusually broad spectrum of mutational MFN2 dysfunction reflects, at least in part, differences
in MFN2 protein partnering.Our translational research goal will determine if tissue-specific disease
phenotypes caused by different human MFN2 mutations accrue from distinct patterns of MFN2
dysfunction due to mutational perturbation of specific protein pairing events. We predict that impaired
MFN2-Parkin mediated mitophagy preferentially affects cardiac myocytes, while impaired MFN2-Miro
regulated mitochondrial motility preferentially affects neurons.
 In pursuing these goals we will employ new concepts and reagents that we developed to
dissect molecular mechanisms that drive metabolic remodeling in normal and diseased hearts, and to
develop translatable means of optimizing myocardial metabolism by fine-tuning mitochondrial quality
and quantity via precision manipulations within the mitochondrial fusion/motility/mitophagy
interactome."
10782335,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adverse event (AE) is a critical component of clinical trial for safety data to protect patients from unnecessary
risk and to develop safety profile of the drug for benefit-risk assessment. Meanwhile, various studies showed
association of AE with clinical outcomes in lung cancer, such as hypertension and immune-related adverse event
with improved survival outcomes and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlated with worse survival.
However, due to the complexity, AE data has been underutilized with sub-optimal AE reporting (e.g., the worst
grade method) to inefficiently assess a patient safety and efficacy profile. While existing approaches have tried
to improve characterization of AE profile, limitations have prevented their board application due to either limiting
to single AE analysis, lack of full utilization of AE parameters, difficulty of interpretation, or uncertainty of clinical
relevance. This highly translational study aims to change the paradigm of AE data usage from descriptive
summary into modern informative AE biomarkers to fulfill precision medicine. We hypothesize that AE-derived
biomarkers have clinically predictive values in lung cancer because of its ability to extensively assess grade,
treatment relatedness, occurrence, frequency, and duration. We also believe that comprehensive AE data
analysis by modern strategy from overall AEs, toxicity category AEs, to individual AEs, will facilitate development
of integrative AE biomarker signatures in predicting clinical outcomes.
Two innovative research Aims are proposed to achieve the overall study objective. Aim 1 is to evaluate AE
biomarkers for predictive values of clinical outcomes in lung cancer. Given the promising AE preliminary data,
we will first test our new framework for identifying AE’s association with treatment response and survival
outcomes in a unique set of new study cohorts in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with
immunotherapy (Aim 1.1). We will further evaluate AE biomarkers for clinical association in NSCLC treated with
chemotherapy or precision therapy (Aim 1.2). Aim 2 is to build a modern AE analysis tool to facilitate identification
of clinical-associated AE biomarkers and generation of automated informative AE report. We will develop new
clinically relevant AE analysis functions to enhance data analysis and AE report (Aim 2.1). We will then integrate
the developed AE analysis functions into a user-friendly tool for streamline data analysis and automated report
generation (Aim 2.2).
If successful, the AE-derived biomarkers could help clinicians early determine who should stay in the trial for
treatment benefit (e.g., treatment-related low-grade AEs) and who should be discontinued due to ineffective
treatment (e.g., higher-grade AEs). The informative AE analysis tool could be leveraged by clinical and research
scientists to discover novel AE biomarkers and facilitate vast meaningful AE research hypotheses."

This project seeks to expand upon a current project (PI:Skeens, R00NR019115; Improving Adherence
Through mHealth for Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients), a pilot RCT intervention trial. The
goal of the parent project is to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of the mHealth app,
BMT4me, in a prospective, longitudinal pilot RCT with caregivers of children during the acute phase post-
HSCT. The rationale is that a mHealth app designed to send medication reminders to caregivers will increase
adherence to immunosuppressant medication, thereby potentially reducing graft vs host disease (GVHD),
readmissions, and mortality. The need for a Spanish version of the BMT4me adherence app came from
knowledge gained in the pilot K99. One-third of families spoke Spanish and were ineligible to participate
in the study. Additionally, only 20% of medication apps offer alternative languages. Thus, there is an
urgent need to develop and evaluate innovative, accessible, and evidence-based approaches, inclusive of
linguistically diverse families, to increase adherence among children receiving HSCT.
During this R21, we will transcreate the current BMT4me to Spanish. The digital health app sends medication
and refill reminders, tracks reasons for missed doses and symptoms in real time, creates a weekly summary to
be exported and shared with providers, and includes a notes section that allows for picture upload and storage
to communicate with providers in clinic. The app will also obtain reasons for non-adherence, adding to our
knowledge of barriers to adherence in this population. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) use a
community-based participatory research approach to transcreate the app for Spanish-speaking families; and 2)
conduct user testing with 30 Spanish-speaking caregivers of children receiving HSCT at two sites to further
refine BMT4me for inclusion in the ongoing pilot RCT. The rationale for transcreation, using a community
based participatory research (CBPR) approach, is that it actively seeks to incorporate the input and
recommendations of bilingual native Spanish-speaking research team members and community partners in the
translation process to mitigate problems commonly encountered with the standard translation-backtranslation
process. A Community Advisory Board will engage in an iterative review of study content and the intervention
to improve cultural accuracy, assist in maintaining intended meaning, and advise on culture-specific
alterations. The successful completion of this project will enable us to expand enrollment in the R00 to be
inclusive of Spanish-speaking families. This project will support a culturally-responsive, mHealth intervention
that will significantly advance the science of adherence and inform more equitable approaches to clinical care
for linguistically diverse children receiving HSCT, thereby, advancing health equity for all families post-HSCT.
The goal is to promote more equitable care and reduce health disparities among children receiving HSCT. In
addition, there is great potential to adapt our work for children with other chronic conditions."

The cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are thought to be key effectors of airway inflammation, but remarkably
little is known about either their global function within the respiratory tract or the potential consequences of
their complete inhibition by newly available biologic drugs. The overall goal of the proposed research is to
define the underlying human biology of IL-4Rα and IL-5R signaling in airway inflammation, both their role in
driving type 2 inflammation and their role in counterregulating other systemic immune pathways. We will
determine the cell-specific impacts of these cytokines within the respiratory tract and confirm the influence
of IL-4Rα and IL-5R on the chronic inflammation of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
(CRSwNP), severe asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Further, given that some
drugs now available to inhibit these pathways have poorly understood side effects like new-onset joint pain,
we will establish the systemic immunologic consequences of inhibiting a receptor as widely expressed as
IL-4Rα and will identify novel biomarkers to predict those immune responses. In three separate but
interrelated projects, we aim to:
 1. Define the cellular mechanism(s) of anti-IL-4Rα-induced therapeutic benefit in AERD with a
 prospective study of 8 weeks of dupilumab treatment.
 2. Define the systemic immunologic consequences of IL-4Rα inhibition with dupilumab and determine
 which immunologic changes correlate with the development of arthralgias.
 3. Characterize the functional significance of IL-5Rα on upper airway nasal plasma cells and epithelial
 cells, from patients with healthy sinus mucosa, CRSwNP, and AERD.
These goals will be achieved using patient-oriented research (POR), as each of these aims involve patient
interactions and longitudinal study visits to collect and verify clinical outcomes, and through the mentorship
of the next generation of patient-oriented allergic disease investigators. The proposed studies and the
clinical questions to be examined offer outstanding training opportunities for junior investigators interested in
clinically relevant research in allergy and asthma. Dr. Tanya Laidlaw is a recognized investigator in the
causes of CRSwNP and AERD and the candidate's many ongoing POR projects and collaborations,
commitment to and track record of mentorship, along with the exceptional institutional resources, provide a
first-rate environment for the development of junior investigators. Critically, this award will provide Dr.
Laidlaw protected time for POR in airway inflammation and allergic respiratory disease to both refine her
mentoring and leadership skills and expand her expertise to include predictive biomarker identification,
pathway-level multi-omics analysis, and high dimensional data analyses."

Despite the necessary role of dopamine in nicotine reinforcement, it is not sufficient to explain the complexity of
addiction. Additional processes, particularly the ability of cues associated with nicotine exposure to develop
control over behavior, are essential for ongoing drug seeking. Both human subjects and rodents experience
reward-enhancement when exposed to nicotine. This has led to the idea that one of the primary factors driving
nicotine addiction is its ability to potentiate the value of other appetitive stimuli and to accelerate cue-reward
learning. In this proposal, we will investigate novel, circuit-level mechanisms that may underlie the ability of
nicotine to potentiate responding for appetitive stimuli. We have discovered two, potentially interacting,
microcircuits that increase responding for rewards and reward-paired cues, and have used proteomic,
transcriptomic epigenomic approaches to identify intracellular pathways downstream of nAChRs that contribute
to cellular and morphological plasticity following nicotine administration and could underlie potentiated cue-
reward responding. Our Aims are to determine the role of a ventral tegmental area to ventral pallidum, and a
basal forebrain to basolateral amygdala pathway, in enhanced cue-reward behavior, to determine whether
these pathways interact, and to identify effects of nicotine on these circuits, as well as signaling pathways
involved in neuronal plasticity that could maintain long-term changes in reward-related behaviors. Together,
these proposed studies will go beyond initial steps of nicotine reward mediated through DA signaling to identify
circuits and signaling pathways involved in the ability of nicotine to potentiate rewarding responses, processes
that likely contribute to long-term susceptibility to nicotine addiction and relapse."

BCCs are the most common type of human malignancy in the US, affecting more than 3 million Americans
annually. Defective regulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, typically through loss of function of the tumor
suppressor Patched (PTCH) leading to oncogenic activation of SMO, are thought to be the primary drivers of
BCC growth. Ligand binding to PTCH relieves SMO repression, triggering its migration to the primary cilium with
activation of GLI transcription factors that drive cell proliferation/tumor growth. Aberrant HH signaling underlies
the Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, also known as basal cell nevus syndrome(BCNS), a dominantly inherited disorder in
which affected individuals are born with one functional PTCH allele and during life acquire mutations in the
second allele that accelerate HH signaling and drive the growth of BCCs in these patients whose inordinate
tumor burden necessitates multiple costly mutilating surgical procedures over their lifetime. Furthermore, Hh
inhibitors (HHi) are associated with intolerable side-effects in treated individuals such that half the patients
discontinue treatment despite substantial anti-tumor efficacy. Our group and others around the world have
fostered bench-to-bedside clinical trials with drugs that target HH signaling and in 2012 these efforts resulted in
FDA approval of vismodegib, a potent orally administered SMO inhibitor for the treatment of locally advanced,
surgically inoperable and potentially fatal BCCs. Despite their undeniable efficacy, the utility of currently available
HH signaling inhibitors is hampered by rapid development of tumor resistance and tumor recurrence. While
uninhibited Hh signaling clearly drives BCC resistance and recurrence, many BCCs do not manifest SMO
mutations indicating involvement of additional tumorigenic mechanisms. We have discovered that vismodegib
resistance involves dysregulation of the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD7 and BRD9 of the
SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) nucleosome remodeling complexes. Utilizing genetically well-
defined in vitro and in vivo murine models of BCC, and patient-derived human BCC cells, our preliminary data
compellingly demonstrate that (i) HHi resistance is associated with global decreases in histone acetylation and
chromatin accessibility, and (ii) genetic ablation of BRD7 renders drug-naïve BCC cells resistant to HHi. Based
on our preliminary data, this application will test the hypothesis that the BRD7-BRD9 nexus drives HHi resistance
and that the BRD9 blockade prevents the emergence of HHi resistance. Aim 1 will probe the chromatin
modifications and gene expression signatures associated with HHi resistance, and their relevance to the BRD7-
BRD9 axis. Aim 2 will test in vivo consequences of genetic manipulation of the BRD7 and BRD9 nexus in
genetically-defined models (i.e., epidermis-specific deletions in BRD7 [Brd7 KO] or Akt1 [Akt1+/-]. Aim 3 will test
the potential utility of select BRD9 and Akt inhibitors for overcoming/preventing HHi resistance using an in vivo
BCC model system developed in the PI’s laboratory that faithfully mimics human BCNS and previously was used
to verify the efficacy and safety of HHi."

 Visual information is processed through a set of neural circuits that organize into functional
maps distributed throughout the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebral cortex. However, little is known
about how circuits develop and organize in the retina, where this information processing begins. The
goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms underlying the development of the circuits that
mediate direction selectivity (DS) in the retina. Classic studies show that the distribution of preferred
directions, referred to as the DS map, align with the cardinal axes–– superior-inferior and anterior-
posterior. However, recent characterization has shown that the DS map follows the axes defined by
optic flow. As a result, the DS map across the adult retina changes as a function of location, where
the clusters are orthogonal to one another closer to the optic nerve and become skewed as distance
from the optic nerve increases. This map is present at eye opening. How this complex organization
arises prior to eye opening is not known. This prompts an investigation of the developmental factors
that contribute to the formation of DS maps.
 Direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond robustly to motion in a preferred direction
and weakly to motion in the opposite, or null, direction. In order to achieve this computation, DSGCs
receive greater synaptic inhibition during null direction motion from starburst amacrine cells (SACs)
via precise wiring patterns. Interestingly, during the developmental period where DSGCs are wiring
up with SACs, the retina is spontaneously active. This activity presents itself as waves propagating
across the surface of the retina––termed retinal waves.
 In this proposal, I will explore the role of retinal waves, specifically waves driven by cholinergic
signaling, in the development of DS maps. Additionally, I propose to investigate the synaptic basis
underlying the formation of this distinct organization across the retinal surface. As a first step
towards understanding whether retinal waves influence DS map formation, I will use two-photon
population calcium imaging, genetic tools, and pharmacology to assess how the DS map develops in
the presence and absence of patterned spontaneous activity across development. To achieve this, I
will use a mouse model where cholinergic waves are severely disrupted by knocking out the β2
subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Aim 1). Moreover, given the extent to which
asymmetric inhibition is necessary for directional tuning, I propose that the tuning of inhibitory inputs
onto DSGCs will change at varied locations in the retina, to account for the skewing of preferred
directions. To test this, I will use two-photon-targeted voltage clamp recordings to unmask the
synaptic basis of this organization (Aim 2). These findings will provide key insights into the
mechanisms that underlie this precise organization during development."

The Role of the Mutant p53-PARP-MCM Pathway in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Mutant p53 (mtp53) is found in 80% of triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). There is a need
to increase understanding of mtp53 signaling in TNBC in order to determine strategies to detect
and treat the disease. TNBCs are more common in African American women than in white
women and therefore the proposed work will benefit all women with TNBC including the AA
over-represented population. This application proposes to determine the biological role of
TNBC-associated gain-of-function oncogenic mtp53 R273H that is associated with PARP1
(herein referred to as PARP) protein, MCM2-7 helicases and replicating DNA. The p53 Arg 273
substituted with His, and other hotspot p53 missense mutant proteins, are well known to
function as oncogenic proteins in TNBCs, but their functions outside of acting as aberrant
transcription co-factors are not clearly understood. The R273H mtp53 is present in high levels
on chromatin in many TNBCs and works as a co-factor to activate the transcription of sterol
biosynthesis genes and chromatin remodeling factors, but incredibly R273H also co-associates
with PARP and MCMs on replicating DNA. Our studies have uncovered this novel replication-
associated pathway and we call it the mtp53-PARP-MCM chromatin axis. Our preliminary and
published data reports that knockdown of mtp53 R273H reduces chromatin associated MCM2-7
and PARP. Knockdown of mtp53 in this setting decreases combined PARP inhibitor (PARPi)
talazoparib plus DNA damaging agent temozolomide-mediated cell death, demonstrating that
mtp53 expression influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to synergistic PARPi plus DNA
damage mediated cell killing. Our preliminary and published data showed nuclear mtp53
R273H co-associates with PARP and MCMs and mtp53 R273H directly associates with EdU at
nascent replication forks. Furthermore, we detected high mtp53 R273H, high PARP protein, and
high PARP enzymatic activity in patient derived xenograft tissue expressing R273H mtp53. We
also detected high co-association of mtp53 and PARP in TNBC in a preliminary tumor
microarray screen as well as through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas reverse phase
protein data sets. As a result, we consider understanding the biology of chromatin-associated
mtp53-PARP-MCM complexes on replicating DNA to be an area of inquiry that will have a
sustained long-term influence on our understanding, detection, and treatment choices for TNBC
in diverse populations of women. The mtp53-PARP-MCM axis in TNBC is an innovative
pathway and elucidating the mechanistic relationship of the proteins working together in
replication-associated activities will help us to better understand the disease. Our hypothesis
is that stable mtp53 interacts with replicating DNA during replication stress using amino
acids from its carboxy-terminal regions. As a consequence, the mtp53-PARP-MCM axis is
engaged allowing increased recruitment of protein complexes and sensitivity to PARP
inhibitors combined with DNA damaging agents. We will test this hypothesis by the following
three aims.
Aim 1: Elucidate the role and mechanism of the TNBC-associated oncogenic mtp53-
PARP-MCM axis.
Aim 2: Increase our understanding of co-expression of mtp53 and PARP using novel
imaging platforms in xenograft mouse models and screening of multiethnic human
breast tissue microarrays to benefit all women with TNBC.
Aim 3: Validate the driver role of the mtp53-PARP-MCM axis influencing PARPi outcomes
in orthotopic mouse models.
Completing this work will provide mechanistic insights on how mtp53 cross-talks with PARP and
MCM proteins on chromatin in cell culture and xenograft models, and will inform the potential of
using novel imaging agents to detect nuclear co-expression of mtp53 and PARP as informative
biomarkers for TNBC."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fatal disease that currently afflicts almost six million Americans. With an
aging population, we risk a public health crisis by 2050, unless effective treatments are identified. Despite
extensive research, there are currently no drugs that slow or alter the course of disease. AD is defined by the
presence of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal tau inclusions called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in
the brain. Drug candidates that reduce Aβ plaques have not, yet, been shown to have clinical benefit, and
growing data suggests that it may be more important to target NFTs over Aβ plaques to prevent cognitive
decline. Recently, the macroautophagy-lysosomal pathway of protein degradation has emerged as a
compelling target for reducing pathogenic tau in the brain. Our hypothesis is that increasing the rate of tau
degradation will reduce tau levels and stop, or greatly slow, the rate of tau aggregation. We recently
discovered a novel pathway to accomplish this objective. Inhibiting the farnesylation of Rhes, a GTPase
protein in the Ras family, activates the lysosome and results in the selective degradation of pathological
tau. Confirmation of the therapeutic hypothesis was achieved by administering a farnesyltransferase inhibitor
(FTI) in a mouse model of tauopathy, which reduced tau pathology and attenuated behavioral abnormalities in
the mice.
 Known FTIs are not suitable for human development as CNS drugs. Optimized for cancer indications,
they are efficiently pumped out of the brain by efflux proteins. We propose a three-pronged approach to identify
chemical matter that can reach pharmacologically significant and dose-proportional brain levels. For two of the
known inhibitors, L-778,123 and lonafarnib, we will make strategic changes to the structures, eliminating
functional groups that serve as recognition substrates for the efflux pumps. Concurrently, we will initiate a high-
throughput screen of a chemical library with chemical properties consistent with known CNS drugs. As a third
step, we will engage in a multi-million compound artificial intelligence-based virtual screen with AtomWise to
identify novel FTIs. By generating x-ray co-crystal structures of the most promising hits and using computer-
aided drug design, we plan to accelerate the process of hit validation, lead discovery, and optimization to
identify small molecule drug candidates. We will advance inhibitors to an in vivo pharmacodynamic model
and select compounds with linear pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships that can be
advanced into the clinic. Three of the top compounds will be tested for efficacy in a tauopathy animal model
using doses derived from the PK/PD relationship. Short-term studies will identify compounds that reduce all
pathogenic tau species. The most efficacious compound will be moved into long-term dosing studies to
evaluate life-span extension and reduction in NFT formation."

Development of cognitive problems at any age is devastating, but development of cognitive problems in
working-age people with dependents represents a major public health concern. Young-onset Alzheimer's
disease (YOAD) is defined as individuals who present before age 65 and lack mutations known to cause
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Neuropathology and neuroimaging studies demonstrate greater tau
accumulation in YOAD who often present with atypical, non-amnestic syndromes. Our preliminary data
demonstrates that tau accumulation occurs through progressive maturity levels in tangle-bearing neurons,
which disproportionately affects cortical more than limbic structures in YOAD. Moreover, we show younger age
onset is associated with greater tangle accumulation and neuronal loss in nucleus basalis of Meynert
(cholinergic hub) and locus coeruleus (noradrenergic hub) – two neuromodulatory hubs implicated in early
stage of disease. As stereotypic amyloid-β plaque patterns are robustly observed regardless of age, and
comorbid neuropathologies are less frequent in YOAD, this cohort is ideally suited for a targeted investigation
of selective vulnerabilities to tangle pathology in AD. Regional vulnerabilities to advanced tangle maturity levels
in corticolimbic structures and neuromodulatory hubs are hypothesized to underlie the syndromic heterogeneity
observed in YOAD. The overall goal of this grant is to uncover signatures of regional and cellular vulnerabilities
underlying syndromic heterogeneity in YOAD by investigating what modifies patterns of tangle accumulation
and microglial activation. Our preliminary data from single-cell RNA sequencing underscores the importance of
considering disease heterogeneity and the utility of quantitative neuropathology for validating gene expression
changes. This proposal seeks to shift current research in AD by focusing on younger-aged individuals and
demonstrating how regional variability can inform cellular biology even in the context of end-stage disease. To
accomplish our goals and facilitate stratification by atypical and typical (amnestic) clinical syndromes, the MPI
team has combined expertise and resources to amass one of the largest documented YOAD cohorts totaling
558 brains with available tissue for study. The goal of the grant is to test the following hypotheses: 1)
Modifiers of the neuropathologic patterns of tau pathology in YOAD brains differ between cases stratified
by atypical vs. typical (amnestic) clinical syndromes, 2) The most vulnerable neuronal populations to AD-tau
share a similar molecular signature across corticolimbic regions reflective of syndromic heterogeneity in
YOAD, and 3) Corticolimbic microglial activation patterns differ in the brains of YOAD cases stratified by
atypical vs. typical (amnestic) clinical syndrome. Completion of this project will identify specific cell populations
vulnerable to regional AD-tau pathology and identify modifiers of microglial activation patterns corresponding to
aggressive tau accumulation in YOAD."

Frailty-related medical expenses cost approximately $18 billion annually in the USA. Progressive losses in
skeletal muscle (SKM) mass and function, often observed with aging and type 2 diabetes (T2D), contribute to
phenotypic frailty characterized by slow gait speed, weakness, weight loss, fatigue, and low physical activity.
T2D increases frailty risk by nearly 50% and risk for both conditions increases with age; therefore, preventing
progression to T2D in older adults with prediabetes is critical. Additionally, SKM is the largest glucose disposal
site in the body and insulin responsiveness, a component of glycemic control, is essential to maintain functional
SKM mass. Thus, impaired glycemic control, a pathophysiological change underlying the development of T2D
and observed in prediabetes, increases frailty risk. Conversely, improving capillarization and mitochondrial
function support increased SKM mass and glycemic control, thereby decreasing T2D and frailty risk. Together,
these SKM architectural variables (e.g., cross-sectional area [CSA], capillarization, mitochondria) are attractive
targets for interventions such as exercise in prediabetic older people. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has
been used effectively in older adults with SKM benefits similar to those from aerobic and resistance training, and
is more time-efficient. However, prediabetic older people may be exercise-intolerant or -resistant, underscoring
the need for alternative therapies in place of (or in addition to) exercise. Emerging evidence supports repeated
heat therapy as an alternative method to improve glycemic control and SKM architecture, and such adaptations
may also improve muscle growth responses to subsequent exercise. Heat-sensitive transient receptor potential
vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), a highly Ca2+-permeable ion channel, is a promising mechanistic candidate
underlying SKM adaptations to repeated heat stress. While whole-body heat therapy is widely studied, local heat
therapy (e.g., heat pad) is more practical and likely provides similar health benefits. Whether local heat therapy
would have similar benefits to HIIT or whether heat pre-conditioning would improve adaptations to subsequent
HIIT in prediabetic older adults is unknown. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of this ESI R01 application is that
local heat therapy improves SKM architecture, glycemic control, and subsequent exercise adaptations, and
decreases frailty risk in prediabetic older adults, with TRPV1 as an underlying mechanism. The project’s specific
aims will test whether: 1) local heat therapy improves SKM architecture, glucose tolerance, and frailty indicators
similar to HIIT in older prediabetic people; 2) local heat therapy pre-conditioning improves the SKM response to
HIIT in older prediabetic people; and 3) TRPV1 mechanistically underlies SKM adaptations to heat therapy. The
findings of this study will provide evidence supporting a directly translatable local heat therapy intervention for
older adults at risk for T2D. In line with the Katz mechanism, the proposed work leverages the expertise of the
PIs and represents a shift in research focus. We propose to test a highly practical and promising intervention to
combat metabolic complications in aging, a crucial area of study with the current aging population."

Breathing is necessary for survival, and failure to breath results in death. Simultaneously, the precise and flexible
control of breathing is crucial for maintaining homeostasis (e.g., blood oxygenation during exertion), and to serve
higher order functions such as vocalization. The neural control for both the inexorable and the flexible capabilities
of breathing arises from the activity of neurons in the brainstem. The intrinsically rhythmic pre-Bötzinger complex
(preBötC) is thought to be the core or “kernel” driving rhythm generation, but a distributed network of neural
centers that extend rostrally and caudally from the preBötC, known as the Ventral Respiratory Column (VRC),
has been implicated in control of varied aspects of respiration (e.g., inspiration, expiration, sighing, gasping).
Lesion experiments and isolated recordings from in-vitro brain slices have given insights into the roles of the
different sub-nuclei that govern respiration. However, it remains unknown how the activity of these neuronal
populations is dynamically coordinated to adjust respiratory behaviors during normal breathing and gasping.
Here, we record simultaneously from large, spatially distributed populations of genetically identified single
neurons across the VRC in-vitro and in-vivo. Based on our preliminary data, we propose a novel “dynamic
switching” hypothesis: coordinated neural networks recruit discrete, but anatomically overlapping, populations of
neurons to drive unique respiratory behaviors. Moreover, the respiratory role (e.g. inspiratory/expiratory) of
individual neurons is not static, as is currently thought, but dynamic and changes with respiratory behavior. This
hypothesis is analogous to phenomena observed in locomotor gaits in which discrete spatiotemporal muscle
patterns give rise to discrete modes of movement (e.g. walking, trotting, galloping). This proposal tests the
dynamic switching hypothesis through three specific aims: Aim 1 quantifies the dynamic and coordinated
respiratory roles of single neurons in in-vitro brain slices and in-vivo in anesthetized, breathing mice. We employ
state-of-the-art high-density electrophysiology (Neuropixels) with optogenetic techniques to identify the
functional role and genetic identity of hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons and compare the
coordinated activity of these populations both between in-vitro and in-vivo preparations. Aim 2 describes how
these dynamic networks reconfigure during gasping. Lastly, in Aim 3 we corroborate results in freely behaving
animals where respiratory behaviors are highly flexible (e.g. sniffing) and are modulated by top-down centers."

Use of alcohol and alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains high in modern American society. It is estimated that in
2020 over half of the adult population (54.9% of those 18 years or older) used alcohol resulting in 27.6 million
adult Americans (11%) diagnosed with AUD. The US Centers for Disease Control estimated the annual average
deaths attributable to excessive alcohol use to be more than 140,000 and the economic cost of AUD to be $249
billion. Current treatments for AUD include a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and other
counseling. Currently there are four FDA approved medications for treatment of AUD; disulfiram, naltrexone,
extended-release naltrexone, and acamprosate. Although it appears that approximately 25% of those with AUD
achieve recovery (that is, asymptomatic low risk drinking or abstinent) without treatment, those receiving any
form of treatment tended to have better outcomes. Unfortunately, only 1.1 million (or 4% of the 27.6 million
eligible) received any form of treatment, with 362,000 (1.3%) receiving treatment with an approved
pharmacological therapeutic highlighting the need for improved access to care and more effective and better
tolerated pharmacological treatments.
Preclinical and available clinical data highlight the potential of selective, reversible ALDH2 inhibition as a
promising validated target for treatment of AUD. Amygdala Neurosciences is developing ANS-858, a proprietary,
potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of ALDH2, for the safe treatment of AUD.
Our objective is to 1) conduct a study to affirm the efficacy of ANS-858 in an animal model of AUD occurs
at doses predicted to be efficacious and 2) complete the requisite IND-enabling studies with ANS-858, to
enable submission of an IND for the safe treatment of patients with AUD.

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 44 million individuals worldwide, and the number is projected to triple
by 2050. However, currently there is no cure for AD. Observational epidemiology studies have identiﬁed some
modiﬁable lifestyle-related risk factors associated with AD; if these risk factors are indeed causal to, but not just
effects of, AD, they can be targeted in interventions to reduce the incidence of AD. To alleviate the challenges
facing observational studies with likely confounding and reverse causation, we develop and apply a suite of novel,
robust and powerful causal inference methods by integrating the large amount of existing large-scale GWAS of
AD and other traits. Speciﬁcally, ﬁrst, going beyond existing two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR), we
will develop the following new methods that are more powerful and more robust with less stringent modeling
assumptions: transcriptome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding and invalid instrumental
variables, co-localization detection of causal genetic variants for multiple traits, and orienting the causal direction
between two traits using multiple (possibly correlated) genetic variants as instrumental variables. Second, we will
adapt and apply both the new and existing methods to multiple large-scale GWAS datasets with AD and other
molecular/imaging/clinical traits to comprehensively search and identify not only AD target genes, but also brain
areas and their functional connectivities, and other risk factors, that are putatively causal to AD. As a byproduct,
we will develop and distribute software implementing the proposed methods."
10772808,"The developing spinal cord has long been a classic model for understanding neurodevelopmental mechanisms
yet linking developmental cell types to their adult counterparts has proved elusive. Developmental transcription
factors are required for the differentiation and specification of cell types during embryogenesis and are expressed
in discrete domains in the developing spinal cord. Yet in the adult, expression of these developmental
transcription factors is lost making it difficult to connect embryonic progenitor domains to their adult cell types
and function. We will address this gap in knowledge by tracking developmental lineages over time using
genetic lineage tracing of molecularly-defined progenitor domains and assaying the changes in
transcription, epigenome, and anatomical distribution. Comprehensive understanding of the developmental
lineages will reveal true structural and functional complexity of spinal cord circuits that are not reflected in single-
cell transcriptomics of adult tissue. We will focus on the developing dorsal progenitor domains that give rise to
adult cell types of the dorsal to intermediate spinal cord. The dorsal spinal cord is the primary area for integration
of somatosensory stimuli from the periphery and consists of the senses of nociception (pain), thermosensation
(temperature), mechanosensation (touch), pruriception (itch), and proprioception (limb and body position).
 The goal of this proposal is to generate three types of mouse atlases. In Aim 1, we will generate a molecular
signature developmental atlas that catalogs the transcriptional and epigenomic changes of dorsal progenitor
domain lineages using the 10x Genomics Multiome platform. We have identified five CRE-recombinase mouse
lines that together will isolate progenitor domains of the developing spinal cord. We will use these lines to assay
the molecular signatures of these lineages at three major time points across the lifetime of the animal and along
the rostral-caudal axis. In Aim 2, we will generate an anatomical phenotype developmental atlas to understand
the distribution of the molecular signatures using standard histological techniques and a multiplexed spatial
transcriptomics platform, MERSCOPE. In Aim 3, we will create a molecular lineage 3-dimensional atlas of all
five CRE-lineages at adult stages using the TissueCyte platform.
 Altogether, these three atlases will provide an invaluable resource for the spinal cord and somatosensory
neuroscience community. Comprehensive cell profiling of the dorsal spinal cord will catalog spinal cell types in
native states that can be compared to injured or diseased states. It will also serve as a reference for the cell type
profiling of the spinal cord in other species. Furthermore, by adding on a layer of developmental lineage, we will
answer long standing questions about the development of the spinal cord. Understanding this developmental
relationship will provide insight into whether a particular adult cell type is constrained by its developmental
lineage, how discrete progenitor domains generate the diversity of cell types in the adult spinal cord and lay the
necessary foundation for cell-type regeneration and engineering efforts for spinal cord tissue."

Antibody-based therapeutics have grown rapidly over the past two decades. However, many challenges limiting
the success of this drug class persist. First, the attrition rate remains high in antibody drug development. Second,
many antibody therapeutics exhibit only transient pharmacologic action. As a result, antibody therapeutics benefit
only a subset of patients. A key driver of these issues is our poor understanding of antibody pharmacology in
vivo across biological contexts. Our research has revealed that antibody pharmacology is highly dependent on
the physical and biological contexts of the biological environments where their actions occur. Methods and tools
that integrate tissue physiology, disease pathology, and immune status into the characterization of antibody
pharmacology are sorely needed. Leveraging multi-dimensional spatiotemporal data, we have developed
quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models and experimental tools that allow us to investigate many
facets of antibody context-dependent pharmacology, including tissue-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) and
pharmacodynamics (PD), disease pathology, antibody-mediated immune dynamics, and cell-cell interactions.
Our work has yielded insights for antibody drug development and therapeutic application. In this MIRA, we
propose to apply and refine these experimental and mathematical tools to continue our long-standing efforts to
address critical issues surrounding antibody context-specific pharmacology. Specifically, we will continue our
work in 1) measuring and modeling antibody tissue PK and target engagement in living animals; 2) modeling
antibody-mediated cell-cell contact and interactions across biological contexts; and 3) determining the roles of
the constant region (Fc) and effector function in soluble target neutralization. In project 1, our lab has developed
a proximity-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) imaging approach. This BRET imaging
technology can longitudinally measure antibody exposure and target engagement within tissues of living animals,
elucidating the physiological and biophysical factors that govern and restrict antibody−target binding processes
in vivo. In project 2, we will apply our proximity-based cell-cell imaging tools, coupled with a multidimensional
QSP model for cell-cell interactions, to uncover the biophysical principles of antibody-mediated cell-cell
communication. In project 3, we will investigate the multifactorial aspects of antibody pharmacology for soluble
target neutralization and highlight the critical but neglected roles of Fc variants and effector function. This project
could uncover overlooked mechanisms that have restricted antibody therapeutic development against soluble
targets and expand the field’s design space. Overall, our research will continue to address the fundamental
challenges to efficient antibody development and optimal therapeutic application through the development of
experimental tools and QSP models."

Depression is the most common mental illness in the U.S. affecting nearly 40 million adults age 18 years and
older. Women are more likely to be affected by depression than men. Depression has both genetic and
environmental influences. Depression is a polygenic disorder (due to the combined effects of many genetic
variants) and depression rates differ by sex. The relationship between genes and depression is complex and
influenced by sex. Thus, understanding the shared genetic basis of sex-specific differences for depression has
great potential to lead to new biological understanding of the etiology of depression in females compared to
males and to promote the development of novel and more effective pharmacotherapies.
The underlying goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate methods to examine the role of sex in genetic
association studies of depression. These methods will be applied to the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is one of
the largest biobanks available at present and represents an extensive resource with both genetic data and
depression phenotypes (approximately 474,000 participants). The Mass General Brigham Biobank
(approximately 33,000 participants) will be used for validation and assessment of the robustness of the
approaches.
The grant focuses on methods development applied to depression and the role of sex in genetic association
studies of depression; however, our ultimate goal is to develop approaches that are applicable to a broad range
of mental health and addiction phenotypes. We will also create publicly available software packages to
implement these new approaches, so that they will be broadly accessible to the scientific community."

Respana Therapeutics is advancing a proprietary first-in-class therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb), RT-
002, for the treatment of debilitating and often lethal inflammatory complications associated with acute respiratory
conditions. We have identified a lead candidate, RT-002, and an equally promising alternative. RT-002 targets
the surfactant protein A receptor SP-R210, a host-mediated target that holds the promise of efficacy regardless
of pathogen evolution.
Rigorous in vivo mouse studies have demonstrated not only reduction in mortality but restoration of lung
health as well. Furthermore, RT-002 does not target an individual cytokine pathway, which can have
negative effects. RT-002 thus has the potential to fill a significant gap in the therapeutics arsenal for influenza
since the most widely used tools are vaccines to prevent infection and antiviral drugs to stop infection; however,
these are limited by partial efficacy, vaccine hesitancy, and emergence of drug resistance.
The objective of this Phase II proposal is to continue development of RT-002 and the backup with the goal of
advancing the therapeutic toward clinical trials as quickly and efficiently as possible. Specifically, the Aims
include: 1) Determine RT-002 pharmacological action in human blood through our functional immunophenotype
assays to discern RT-002 target engagement and immune activation in human blood that will inform therapeutic
design in alleviating aberrant immune activation in critically ill patients; 2) Establish pharmacological activity of
RT-002 treatment for severe influenza utilizing humanized FcRn mice to establish safety, toxicity,
pharmacodynamics, dosage, schedule, and duration of treatment to de-risk the development of RT-002 towards
clinical trials in humans; and 3) Establish foundations for Phase I/IIa clinical trials for transition of RT-002 to
clinical testing through existing partnerships with contractual research organizations, critical illness, and critical
trials experts for production and GMP certification of RT-002 in stable CHO cells, and organization and planning
of critical parameters from Aims 1 and 2 that are needed for pre-IND consultation with the FDA and the design
of phase I/IIa clinical trials.
Successful completion of the Aims will allow rapid progress toward IND-enabling studies, IND filling and initial
clinical trials of a new therapeutic for an important and largely unmet clinical need for the treatment of life-
threatening influenza illness."

Children with autism who receive early intervention services have better outcomes than those who do not. It is
therefore imperative to lower the age of diagnosis. There is strong evidence that there are reliable behavioral
signs/symptoms of the disorder that emerge in the second year of life. However, there is mounting evidence from
our laboratory that there are patterns in the EEG that emerge as early as 3 months that are reliably associated
with autism outcomes at 2-3 years. In this proposal we seek to extend our previous work in two important ways.
First, we will deploy our high-dimensional EEG data collection in a large pediatric primary care clinic, thus
demonstrating the potential scalability of EEG as a biomarker of autism risk. Second, we will focus our efforts
on a population of infants who have historically been underserved and understudied: primarily Black and
Hispanic infants growing up in low-income homes. We will enroll 720 infants over 3 years (240/year), and based
on previous work, anticipate a retention rate of 85%. We will collect resting EEG data at 4, 9 and 12 months in
conjunction with their well-baby visits at the clinic. At 24 months diagnostic outcomes will be evaluated using the
ADOS, developmental measures, and expert clinical judgement. In addition to the EEG assessment in the first
year of life, a general developmental screener will be included (Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3) and indices
associated with a number of non-genetic variables associated with increased autism risk (e.g., infant sex,
parental age, prenatal maternal health, etc.) will be obtained from a demographic questionnaire and medical
records. The specific aims of the project are:
Aim 1: Using a prospective study design in a racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse primary
care population, we will identify EEG features measured <1 year of life that are associated with ASD at
2-years of age.
Aim 2: To develop predictive models with EEG biomarkers and other risk factors that reliably predict
later diagnosis of ASD.
Aim 3: To determine the specificity of predictive features for ASD versus other neurodevelopmental
outcomes such as language or cognitive delays.
Our ultimate goal is to create a scalable, practical, neurobiologically-based tool that can be readily integrated
into a pediatric primary care setting, and in so doing, greatly improve our ability to identify autism in the first year.
We believe our approach will allow us to demonstrate scalability of EEG in the primary care setting, develop
usable models for children at greatest risk of delayed diagnosis, and improve our understanding of the underlying
neural mechanisms of idiopathic autism."

High dietary sodium intake increases risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) independent of established risk
factors, including blood pressure (BP). Non-BP mediated mechanisms underlying the increased risk of CVD
associated with dietary sodium intake are not well understood, but observational studies suggest direct target
organ damage in the heart and vasculature might play an important role. Little evidence exists from
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on target organ effects of dietary sodium reduction, and the National
Academy of Medicine has recommended future research to “test the effects of different sodium intake levels on
endothelial and vascular function” in order to “to better characterize the relationship between sodium intake
and chronic disease”. Further, no RCTs have been powered to test the effect of dietary sodium reduction on
subclinical cardiovascular structure and function in African Americans, who are more sensitive to dietary
sodium intake and at higher risk for CVD. The overall objective of the proposed mechanistic trial is to test the
effect of dietary sodium reduction on cardiac and vascular structure and function. Specifically, the proposed
trial will test whether dietary sodium reduction (targeting a dietary sodium intake of <2,300 mg/day) will
improve left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), carotid-femoral
pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) compared to usual intake. Additionally, we will
test whether this effect is independent from BP reduction. We will recruit 240 African Americans with elevated
BP or hypertension from the greater New Orleans area and randomly assign them to a dietitian-led behavioral
intervention aimed at decreasing dietary sodium intake to <2,300 mg/day for 12 months or to a usual diet.
Study outcomes, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)-determined LVMI and LVGLS, cfPWV,
and FMD, will be measured at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month clinic visits using standardized protocols with
stringent quality control. These outcomes are validated biomarkers for target organ damage and predict the
risk of clinical CVD events. In primary analyses, the effect of sodium reduction on each subclinical CVD
endpoint will be compared between the sodium reduction and usual diet groups according to the intention-to-
treat principle without adjusting for covariates. In secondary analyses, changes in ambulatory and clinical BP
will be adjusted to assess the BP-independent effect of dietary sodium reduction on each subclinical CVD
endpoint. The proposed trial has 85% statistical power to detect a clinically significant difference in changes of
the four co-primary outcomes (10 g/m2 in LVMI, 1.3% in LVGLS, 0.9 m/s in cfPWV, and 1.1% in FMD) over 12
months between the two groups at a 2-sided significance level of 0.0125 (0.05/4). This study is the first RCT to
test the effect of dietary sodium reduction on subclinical CVD endpoints in African Americans. Findings from
this trial will fill the knowledge gap of the underlying mechanisms of dietary sodium intake on CVD risk and
provide further evidence on sodium reduction for CVD prevention."

 Light is a profoundly important regulator of physiology and behavior across a wide range of organisms. Light
information is relayed via diverse retinal ganglion cell types to approximately 50 distinct targets in the brain. The
melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) represent 6 of the ~40-50
retinal ganglion cell types present in the mouse retina. M1-M6 ipRGCs are defined by a distinct complement of
subtype-defining morphological, physiological, and transcriptional characteristics. However, how this cellular
diversity is achieved is largely unknown. This proposal will investigate the molecular underpinnings of
ipRGC diversity. ipRGCs also represent an excellent microcosm for studying diversity in the larger RGC
population because 1) ipRGCs can be specifically manipulated with multiple, existing genetic tools, 2)
transcriptional profiling has revealed gene expression programs that designate ipRGC subtypes, and 3) the
diversity of ipRGC subtype morphology, physiology, central projections, and roles in behavior are a broad, and
representative subsample of subtype-defining features of RGCs. Thus, ipRGCs are an approachable,
representative, and genetically malleable population in which to study cellular diversity. In the
experiments outlined below, we will exploit the advantages of the ipRGC system by combining targeted, single
cell measurements of ipRGC morphology and physiology with powerful, large-scale transcriptomic approaches
in new genetic models to assess how the full range of ipRGC subtypes are established. Brn3b (Pouf42) is a
transcription factor involved in RGC specification, and its expression is maintained in ipRGC subtypes into adult
stages, where it is poised to influence developmental and adult gene expression programs that give rise to the
subtype-defining properties of ipRGCs. This proposal will test the hypothesis that Brn3b actively shapes
the morphological, physiological, and transcriptional identity of ipRGC subtypes. In Aim 1 we will use new
mouse lines to manipulate Brn3b expression in ipRGCs during development and adulthood to determine the
consequences of increasing or reducing Brn3b levels on the morphophysiological features of ipRGCs. In Aim 2
we will determine the roles of Brn3b in shaping gene expression patterns across retinal development and within
individual ipRGC subtypes. Excitingly, our preliminary data indicate that Brn3b expression levels in ipRGC
subtypes not only correlate with multiple ipRGC features, but also actively regulate defining features of ipRGC
subtypes, suggesting that Brn3b is repurposed throughout development and adulthood to fine-tune ipRGC circuit
structure and function. These studies will generate a blueprint for understanding how the patterning of
transcriptional programs establishes diverse cellular identities in the retina and nervous system."

Cisgender Black women are frequently overlooked in HIV prevention efforts even though they have one of the
highest incidences of HIV among all subpopulations, second only to men who have sex with men. Pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe and effective daily medication for those at risk for HIV infection. However, data
indicates a substantial inequity in PrEP use among women compared to their need. This proposed study will
evaluate implementation strategies to address multi-level barriers and increase uptake of PrEP among
Black cisgender women in Planned Parenthood clinics in Illinois.
Our team’s preliminary work has identified successful strategies for PrEP Optimization among Women to
Enhance Retention and Uptake (POWER Up). POWER Up implementation strategies address key barriers to
PrEP uptake and include: 1) routine PrEP education 2) standardized provider training, 3) electronic health record
(EHR) tools; and 4) PrEP navigation. These strategies have not been studied in family planning clinics with a
large population of Black cisgender women. Therefore, using implementation science research methods, we
propose to implement and evaluate the impact of the POWER Up strategies within the Planned Parenthood of
Illinois (PPIL) health center setting to improve PrEP care continuum outcomes for Black cisgender women. By
implementing POWER Up strategies in PPIL health centers we seek to address the gap in knowledge in
identifying effective strategies to increase uptake of PrEP among Black cisgender women.
This proposed study aims to:
 1. Adapt POWER Up implementation strategies for engaging Black women in the PrEP care continuum in
 eight Planned Parenthood clinics in Chicago
 2. Determine the effectiveness of POWER Up across eight PPIL sites within Chicago’s high prevalence HIV
 areas; and,
 3. Assess and document implementation outcomes and report on key barriers and facilitators related to successful
 implementation of the intervention
Findings from this study will provide insight into implementation strategies that can support effective replication
across the 800 Planned Parenthood health centers and other health centers providing family planning services
nationwide to reach a greater number of women at risk."

There is a growing body of evidence that obesity is associated with reduced cerebral metabolism; however, the
underlying mechanisms and the functional clinical implications of these observations remain unclear. The
central goal of this project is to investigate a finding we have recently made that obesity is associated with
decreased transport capacity for glucose across the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, this association may be
mediated by circulating fatty acids. This proposal uses state of the art neuroimaging technology coupled with
classic human metabolic phenotyping methodologies to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind how the
brain is impacted by obesity. Aim 1 of this project will determine whether obesity is associated with changes in
brain glucose transport and metabolism using 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy scanning. Aim 2 of this
project will use a randomized controlled study design to assess whether acute elevations of circulating fatty
acid levels amongst lean, healthy control subjects will lead to decreased brain glucose levels. Finally, Aim 3 of
this project will use parallel studies using a rat model to investigate the underlying cellular mechanisms.
Because the brain is exquisitely sensitive to circulating glucose levels, the findings from this proposed study
will help clarify how diminished brain glucose transport in obesity may lead to diminished post-prandial satiety
signaling and/or be a potential mechanism for the neurocognitive consequences of obesity."

The circulating population of microRNAs in biofluids are ideal biomarkers for various diseases. Point-of-care
profiling of circulating microRNAs is in insatiable demand, but typical approaches, e.g., immunoassays and
microRNA assays are lab-based/centralized, expensive ($400–1,000/test), and time-consuming (>6 hours). We
will develop a highly integrated, all-nanobioelectronic platform technology for multiplex, high-accuracy
circulating-microRNA analysis that is capable of profiling circulating microRNAs in a 50-μL plasma with ultra-
high sensitivity (sub-fM) and efficiencies in time (<40 minutes) and cost (<$10/test), thereby enabling high-
performance circulating-microRNA analysis at the point of test. The novelty of the program is to harness
graphene-based bioelectronics to integrate circulating microRNA isolation, concentration, amplification, and
quantification into a self-contained device. In order to proof the concept of this technology, the program will
include the development and validation of two generations of graphene-based analytical platforms, GAP1 and
GAP2. Three specific aims with measurable milestones will be pursued. (1) We will demonstrate that multiple
microRNA analytes can be amplified via hybridization chain reaction on a probe-functionalized graphene sensor
array and the analyte concentrations can be readily interrogated by the graphene sensor array and translated
into electrical signals. We will develop GAP1 to selectively quantify eight pre-selected target microRNAs
(MDCIS8) spiked in 5-μL buffer. The detection limit of the specific microRNAs is expected to be at fM level. (2)
We will demonstrate that target circulating microRNAs can be isolated from plasma by immobilizing them on a
DNA-functionalized graphene electrode and releasing them into a small-volume simple cargo solution upon the
generation of pH gradient by applying voltage bias between the graphene-DNA electrode with a bare graphene
electrode. We will develop a graphene-based circulating-microRNA isolation module, combine the module with
GAP1 to form GAP2, and use GAP2 to profile circulating MDCIS8 in lysed samples of 50-μL plasma from NSG
mice. The GAP2 is expected to concentrate the microRNAs by >5× and deliver sub-fM level sensitivity. (3) We
will demonstrate the feasibility of using this platform technology for diagnostic applications. We will use GAP2 to
quantify circulating MDCIS8, whose expression levels are indicative to pre-invasive breast cancer, in 50-μL
plasma samples from a user blinded cohort of the MIND murine model. The profiling result will be analyzed to
predict the progression of pre-invasive breast cancer whose rapid, inexpensive diagnosis remains a challenge.
The GAP2 prediction outcome will be combined with that based on surgical biopsy to establish the accuracy of
the technology for progression prediction. The expected prediction accuracy is >96%. If successful, the
technology will offer a new pathway to next-generation point-of-care genomic diagnostic/prognostic micro total
analysis systems that would be cheap enough and user friendly enough to be used in various clinical settings."

The prevalence of heart attacks has increased among women between 35-50 years of age compared to men of
the same age. In contrast to men, women have a higher risk of mortality and complications after a heart attack
due to the under-representation of women in clinical trials, the lack of gender-tailored pharmacological
treatments, and potential higher vulnerability of women than for men to traditional and emerging risk factors.
Stress has emerged as an important risk factor for heart disease in women; stress levels have been shown to
correlate with delayed recovery, recurrence, and increased mortality after a heart attack in women. Sex
hormones are considered the critical regulators of the physiological differences between men and women in
health and disease. These hormones certainly contribute to sexual dimorphism in heart disease; however, the
effects of gender on the incidence and outcomes of a heart attack are more complex and are unlikely to be due
to sex hormones alone. The goal of the present proposal is to define one of the signaling pathways underlying
the deleterious effects of stress on female cardiac health in the setting of myocardial ischemia (heart attack). To
accomplish this goal, we propose to investigate the mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids (the primary stress
hormones) affects estrogen cardioprotection in myocardial ischemia by repressing serotonin activity in
cardiomyocytes via glucocorticoid inhibition of estrogen transcriptional regulation of the serotonin receptor 5-
HT2BR (implicated in cardioprotection through the regulation of mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes). A
decrease in serotonin activity has been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction in depressed
patients, and also polymorphisms in serotonin receptors are associated with elevated glucocorticoid response
linked to cardiovascular complications, including an increased incidence of heart attacks. Therefore, we aim to
elucidate estrogen regulatory mechanism of 5-HT2BR expression in the heart and the effects of glucocorticoids
on estrogen-mediated 5-HT2BR signaling in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). We hypothesize that stress exerts
deleterious effects on the female heart in myocardial infarction by exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction via
glucocorticoids inhibition of estrogen transcriptional regulation of 5-HT2BR in cardiomyocytes. We will investigate
this pathway by examining glucocorticoid and estrogen antagonism in cardiomyocytes, the effects of this
crosstalk in I/R (in vivo studies), and the molecular and physiological effects of 5-HT2BR regulation by estrogen
in mitochondrial function in ischemic conditions. If funded, this application will help me develop a scientifically
independent project, acquire training in the cardiovascular field, build a research team, enhance my mentoring
skills, and improve my grant writing skills to become competitive to apply to a major funding mechanism. My
current institution and my mentor and co-mentor will provide me with the necessary facilities and guidance to
accomplish these goals. Also, I will participate in training and career development activities that will strengthen
my scientific career."

Shortage of available allogeneic donor organs represents the greatest unmet medical need in the field of
transplantation today. The survival of pig-to-primate organ transplants has improved markedly over the past
three decades but unfortunately remains insufficient for clinical application. Further progress in this field will likely
depend upon genetic modifications of porcine source animals both to overcome molecular incompatibilities with
primate recipients and to allow the induction of immunological tolerance. The objectives of this proposal are to
produce such pigs and to identify additional genetic modifications that will help attain the goal of clinically relevant
xenograft survival. Advanced genetic engineering techniques, including site-specific recombinase-driven gene
additions and edits using the precision CRISPR-Cas9 system, will be used to specifically modify our inbred swine
with modifications addressing incompatibilities in hematopoietic cytokines (tolerance through hematopoietic
chimerism), to eliminate epitopes recognized by pre-existing antibodies common to human and baboon
recipients (B4galNT2-dependent) and to direct human CD47 to kidney cells in which it may play an important
protective role (podocytes). Genetically modified pigs incorporating the new modifications will be tested in
Projects 1 and 2 for efficacy in promoting organ survival and mixed chimerism for tolerance induction in primate
and humanized mouse models."
10933462,"Most luminal B breast cancers (LBBC; ER+, HER2-wt, Ki67>14%) carry a good prognosis. However,
approximately 20% of LBBC are highly aggressive and resistant to current therapies. Poor-prognosis LBBC
disproportionally impact women of African descent; the majority are MYC-activated. There have been many
failed attempts to therapeutically target MYC. These attempts have failed, in part, due to our current inability to
separate the cancer-promoting activities of MYC, mechanistically or therapeutically, from its normal essential
cellular functions. In preliminary data, we show that the cancer-transforming ability of MYC is dependent on three
lysine (K) residues of MYC (K149, K158, and K323) that are major substrates for acetylation by the histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and GCN5; individual substitutions of these specific sites block the ability of
MYC to transform human mammary cells. Guided by our preliminary data, here we aim to dissect the cofactors
and molecular mechanisms by which these MYC acetyl-K (AcK) residues promote cell transformation and
initiation and progression of LBBC. Our long-term goal is to identify new “druggable” targets to improve survival
of women most affected by aggressive LBBC; consequently, our studies will focus on women of African-descent.
Guided by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that a gene-selective MYC-AcK signaling pathway drives the
aggressive tumor cell biology of therapy-resistant LBBC and involves transcription cofactors and epigenetic
coregulators that “write” and/or “read” AcK marks on MYC and histones, perhaps including cofactors co-
overexpressed with MYC in LBBC, such as PIN1, GCN5, p300, and/or YEATS2. Here, we will investigate the
role of MYC-AcK dependent signaling in luminal mammary cell transformation and aggressive progression of
luminal cancer cells and LBBC tumors as well as identify the cofactors and mechanisms involved.
Characterization of this new MYC oncogenic signaling pathway may provide biomarkers and/or therapeutic
targets for LBBC in women of African descent. Aim 1 will test the impact of MYC-AcK dependent signaling in
mammary epithelial cell transformation and in the aggressive biology of LBBC in women of African-descent. Aim
2 will characterize the molecular mechanisms of MYC-AcK dependent gene regulation in transformed mammary
epithelial cells and in LBBC cells and tumors from women of African-descent."
10933469,"University of California, Riverside (UCR) has never implemented a therapeutic trial. Building therapeutic trial
capacity at UCR was our biggest challenge – and the biggest failure - of our P20 planning grant. City of Hope
Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoHCCC) runs hundreds of therapeutic trials (Phase 0 to 4) ranging from
chemoprevention to Phase 1 CAR-Tcell therapy. In our P20 planning grant, we leveraged an on-going CoHCCC
outreach trial testing, in women with insulin-resistance, testing the ability of metformin to reduce 1) production of
inflammatory cytokines and 2) circulating senescent inflammatory cells. While CoHCCC has implemented this
trial in community centers, the trial rapidly ran into problems at UCR. Key issues were 1) lack of experience of
the UCR Institutional Review Board (IRB) and 2) a need for greater mentorship of UCR investigators. In this U54
grant, we are determined to help UCR open therapeutic trials; however, first we need to build capacity. U54 Pilot
Project 1 uses state-of-the-art single cell-transcriptomics and -ATACseq in the context of a simple therapeutic
trial. This trial tests the ability of standard-of-care metformin to reduce inflammation in insulin-resistant breast
cancer survivors. Under the oversight of David Lo, M.D. Dean of Research at UCR Medical School, the trial will
be conducted at CoH using CoH patients, personnel, and IRB. CoH will provide hands-on training in 1)
therapeutic trials and 2) rigor and reproducibility of clinical biomarkers. CoH’s IRB will use this opportunity to
mentor UCR’s IRB. In Year 3, the trial will be opened for accrual at UCR. Metformin is known to reverse insulin-
resistance and remove senescent cells. In this capacity building trial – we aim to test in insulin-resistant Latina
and African American/Black breast cancer survivors, the hypothesis that metformin can 1) restore metabolic
health (reverse insulin-resistance), 2) reduce H3K9ac-chromatin opening of genes coding for
IL6/TNFα/INFβ, and 3) reduce inflammation and circulating SASP cells. Aim 1 will build UCR clinical-trials
capacity by conducting a UCR-CoH partnered trial at CoH in a diverse cohort. Aim 2 will provide capacity building
in biospecimen collection, biomarker analysis, and rigor and reproducibility. In Aim 3 CoH IRB continues its
mentorship (started during P20) of UCR IRB in regulations for therapeutic trials."
10885173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite enormous strides made in HIV treatment since the epidemic began 40 years ago, in 2020 ~38 million
people globally were living which HIV, and ~1.5 million people are newly infected with HIV every year1.
Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) effectively suppresses HIV replication to virtually undetectable levels
in most HIV infected patients and dramatically reduces the incidence of AIDS. Today however, an estimated
73% of people living with HIV have access to cART leaving ~10 million people without access to treatment.1 It is
therefore imperative to increase access to cART and implement therapies that improve adherence and efficacy.
New drug combinations have reduced to one per day the number of pills needed to be taken to effectively control
HIV greatly facilitating treatment. However, as with other chronic conditions, adherence to daily medications
remains a challenge for many individuals living with HIV due to structural, behavioral, and social barriers2-5. Non-
adherence to treatment has significant consequences including the emergence of drug-resistance and the
potential loss of therapeutic effectiveness6-8. As such, alternative approaches are being explored to decrease
the burden of daily pill administration, including long-acting injectable, oral, and implantable products9-15. The
fundamental hypothesis on which our program is based is that eliminating or reducing the impact of
individual adherence could increase the efficacy of HIV treatment and prevention strategies. In this R01
grant and building on our existing data, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of a biodegradable and highly
tunable polymeric solid implant (PSI) that offers durable and sustained HIV viral suppression, increased user
compliance, and the ability to be removed in case of unanticipated adverse events or allergic reaction. We will
achieve this goal by developing an ultra-long-acting biodegradable PSI using a novel engineering process to
generate small size implants (1-4 cm long) with high drug content (up to 85 wt%). We propose a comprehensive
evaluation of this novel drug delivery approach using modeling efforts to validate an in vitro tool to guide
formulation development and a highly relevant macaque model of infection with RT-SHIV as an invaluable
preclinical tool to assess the efficacy of the PSI to maintain virus suppression. This cutting-edge combined
approach will be utilized to evaluate the scientific premise of our proposal in mice and macaques to investigate
the safety and efficacy of a unique and highly innovative ultra-long-acting PSI technology."
10883700,"Cancer cells depend on reprogrammed metabolic pathways for anabolic proliferation. Discovering these cancer
metabolic vulnerabilities can reveal novel targets for therapy. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
is the causal agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and several other cancers. Despite intensive studies for several
decades, there is currently no effective therapy for KS. Our long-term goal is to delineate the pathogenesis of
KSHV-induced cancers, providing a scientific basis for developing novel therapies. Toward this goal, we have
previously developed an efficient system of KSHV-induced cellular transformation of primary cells and a reverse
genetics system for KSHV mutagenesis. Using these powerful systems, in the current funding period, we have
delineated viral and cellular genes that are essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation and identified
novel therapeutic targets and agents that have the potentials for translating into clinics. In particular, we have
recently discovered that KSHV-transformed cells are addicted to glutamine. Unlike other types of cancer cells
that utilize glutamine to replenish the TCA cycle, glutamine is primarily shunted to nucleotides syntheses by
providing the critical g-nitrogen in addition to amino acids. KSHV hijacks numerous rate-limiting enzymes in these
pathways, including phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) and phosphoribosyl
pyrophosphate synthetases 1 (PRPS1), which is upregulated in KS spindle tumor cells. Significantly, knockdown
of these enzymes suppresses the proliferation of KSHV-transformed cells but has no effect on the
primary/uninfected cells. Our hypothesis is that KSHV encodes specific gene(s) to hijack the nucleotide
synthesis pathways to support the proliferation and survival of KSHV-transformed cells, and hence
targeting these pathways is effective for therapy of KSHV-induced tumors. We have developed 3D Culture
systems that closely representing in vivo metabolic changes, an innovative nanoparticles carbon-dots (Cdots)-
mediated delivery approach for locked nucleic acid (LNA)-siRNAs, and cutting-edge technology of metabolomics
for tracing the carbon and nitrogen flows. We will determine the essential roles of the dysregulated nucleotide
synthesis pathways for KSHV-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis (Aim 1); determine the
mechanisms by which KSHV hijacks the nucleotide synthesis pathways for supporting the proliferation and
survival of KSHV-transformed cells (Aim 2); and target vulnerable genes in the nucleotide pathways using the
Cdots-mediated delivery approach for treating KSHV-induced tumorigenesis (Aim 3). The proposed project is
highly significant as it will test a novel hypothesis of KSHV manipulation of key cellular metabolic pathways
using multidisciplinary innovative approaches and model systems. It is our expectation that the
accomplishment of this project will lead to the identification of novel cancer vulnerabilities of KSHV-induced
cancers, which could provide a scientific basis for developing novel therapies."
10766117,"Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which can result
in severe neurological deficits. The cause of the disease is unknown, the immune and neurodegenerative mechanisms
underlying the pathophysiology of the disease are poorly understood, and current therapies are only partially effective at
slowing disease progression. There is a tremendous need to investigate novel mechanisms that may be contributing to
disease susceptibility and the pathophysiology of this disease. To this end, my laboratory has performed a large miRNA
profiling study on naïve and effector/memory CD4 T cell in untreated MS patients to determine if miRNA may contribute
to disease susceptibility or progression. MiRNA negatively regulate gene expression via the RNA interference pathway,
and thus play a key role modulating the level of specific proteins in cells. We have identified at least two pathways that
are altered in MS patients that may contribute to their susceptibility to develop MS. First, miRNAs targeting components
of the Th2 cell differentiation pathway were elevated in MS patients T cells, skewing differentiation into pro-inflammatory
Th1 cells. Second, miRNAs targeting the TGFβ signaling pathway limited the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Thus, the
defects observed in MS patients CD4 T cells may be at least partially mediated by miRNA dysregulation. In this proposal,
we will address the following questions. Aim 1: Are MS patients’ CD4 T cells defective in their ability to differentiate
into Tregs in a miRNA-dependent manner? Preliminary data indicates that naïve CD4 T cells from MS patients fail to
efficiently differentiate into Tregs. Using miRNA inhibitors, we will determine if this failure to differentiate into Tregs is
dependent on specific miRNAs over-expressed in MS patients and whether Treg differentiation can be normalized MS
patients’ naïve CD4 T cells. Aim 2: How does over-expression of MS-associated miRNAs affect the development and
progression of CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model? Using EAE, the role of miRNAs that target CD4 T cell differentiation
into effector and regulatory T cells will be analyzed in vivo to complement the human in vitro experiments. Aim 3: Can
expression level of miR-128, which targets both effector and regulatory CD4+ T cells, modulate the risk of CNS
autoimmunity? We found that miR-128 targets proteins in the Th2 and TGFβ signaling pathways, promoting the
differentiation of Th1 cells and preventing the development of Tregs. Using CD4-specific miR-128-/- mice and mice
overexpressing miR-128 in CD4 T cells, we will determine if loss of miR-128 in CD4 T cells minimizes susceptibility to CNS
autoimmunity, normalizes CD4 T cell differentiation into effector and regulatory cells, and thus, is a potential therapeutic
target to correct both effector and regulatory T cell defects in MS. In contrast, we will use mice overexpressing miR-128
in CD4 T cells to determine if miR-128 is sufficient to skew CD4 T cell differentiation and enhance the risk of developing
CNS autoimmunity. This study will test the hypothesis that miRNA dysregulation in naïve CD4+ T cells is an underlying
risk factor in CNS autoimmunity that can be therapeutically targeted to normalize effector and regulatory CD4 T cell
function. If our hypothesis is correct, miRNA-based therapies may not only prevent CNS autoimmunity in susceptible
individuals, but ameliorate autoreactive T cells in patients with MS."

An obesogenic Western-style (HF) diet causes low-grade intestinal inflammation, intestinal microbiota
imbalance, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, our knowledge about the pathways
producing each of these different disease manifestations is incomplete, making it difficult to see connections.
Experiments proposed in this application are aimed at addressing this critical gap in knowledge. Our long-range
goal is to elucidate molecular mechanisms that make the gut microbiota a liability during non-communicable
diseases. This application aims to study the mechanisms through which HF diet drives gut dysbiosis and
determine whether the resulting imbalance escalates the production of microbial metabolites that increase the
risk for cardiovascular disease. Our central hypothesis is that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an
obesogenic HF diet activates epithelial repair responses (e.g., crypt hyperplasia), which in turn drives an
expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, a taxon known to produce metabolites that accelerate
atherosclerosis. To test our hypothesis, we will determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction-induced monocyte
recruitment promotes colonic epithelium repair responses (specific aim 1). We will identify the role of colonic
epithelium repair responses in driving HF diet-induced Enterobacteriaceae expansion (specific aim 2). We will
also elucidate the mechanism by which HF diet-induced Enterobacteriaceae expansion increases circulating
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels and promotes cardiovascular disease (specific aim 3). By defining the
complex order of events that links these disease manifestations, we expect the completion of the proposed
experiments to usher in a decisive conceptual advance to understand how HF diet increases cardiovascular
disease risk."

 Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and associated polycyclic aromatic compounds 
(PACs) has long been identified with a large number of human health risks. PAHs are well-known carcinogens 
and mutagens. Current analytical techniques for detection of PAHs and PAC are laboratory based, slow, 
complex, and require expensive instrumentation and sample preparation. We propose an entirely new approach 
combining optical spectroscopic techniques such as Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) and 
Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA). These techniques can also be combined onto a single 
nanoengineered substrate, designed to sensitively identify specific PACs. While these techniques have been 
demonstrated successfully using gold and silver based nanoparticles and nanoengineered substrates, we 
propose to expand these techniques using inexpensive and environmentally friendly Aluminum nanoengineered 
substrates for streamlined ultrasensitive PAH and PAC detection. This platform will utilize polydopamine, a 
biomimetic polymer inspired by mussel adhesive proteins, as coatings for molecular partitioning, selectively 
extracting and adsorbing PAH and PAC molecules from samples of interest onto the nanosensing substrates. In 
preliminary results, this approach has yielded sub-ppb detection sensitivities for PAH molecules extracted from 
liquid samples. Furthermore we propose to design and demonstrate a new type of chemical detector that can 
be fully integrated with SERS and/or SEIRA substrates, to directly generate an electrical signal in response to 
the spectrum of the PAH and PAC molecules. This would eliminate the need for bulky and expensive 
monochromators and dispersive optics, ultimately allowing for the design of ultracompact, “on-chip” detectors 
that can be deployed in the field at superfund sites and in the clinic. Prototypes of this type of direct spectral 
detector have recently been demonstrated by our group. We will also address one of the primary problems 
universal to analyte detection and analysis, the detection of chemical mixtures, likely to be found under actual 
field sampling conditions, by applying a machine learning approach. We propose to develop machine learning 
algorithms that automatically analyze the spectra of multicomponent samples, trained to identify with high 
accuracy and precision their PAH and PAC components. The ultimate outcome of this project is the creation of 
a streamlined, ultracompact, ultrasensitive chemical analysis and detection platform, capable of identifying 
multiple PAHs and PACs in a single sample without costly separation and purification steps, which could be 
readily transitioned to fieldable use."
10767877,"Project Summary
 Pregnant women, living in the vicinity of superfund sites, who may be exposed to polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that emanate from these sites, are at a higher risk for preterm
delivery. Preterm delivery requires the neonate to be subjected to supplemental oxygen
(hyperoxia), and this in turn could lead to chronic lung disease/ bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD). We hypothesize that prenatal PAH exposure will exacerbate the effects of postnatal
supplemental oxygen in preterm neonates. The mechanisms by which PAHs potentiate BPD in
infants are not well understood. The central hypothesis of this project is that prenatal
administration of PAHs [i.e. benzo[a]pyrene (BP), or a mixture of benzo(a)pyrene (BP),
benzo(b)fluoranthrene (BbF), and dibenz[a]anthracene (DBA)], which are which are defined as
class B2 carcinogens by USEPA, will differentially exacerbate lung injury and alveolar
simplification in neonatal mice following postnatal hyperoxia, and that this effect will be altered in
mice lacking the gene for cytochrome P450 (Cyp)1a1 or 1a2 genes by mechanisms entailing a
combination of genotoxic and epigenetic mechanisms. We will also test the hypothesis that the
infants exposed prenatally to PAHs have a greater risk of developing BPD than those exposed to
lesser or no PAHs, and that human pulmonary cells exposed to remediated PAHs will exhibit
lesser toxicity than parent PAHs. In order to test these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific
Aims: (1). Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure of wild type (WT) (C57BL/6J)
mice to the PAH BP or a mixture of PAHs (BP + BbF + DBA) will result in exacerbation of lung injury and
alveolar simplification following postnatal hyperoxia, and this effect will be altered in mice lacking the gene
for Cyp1a1, 1a2 or 1b1. 2. To determine the mechanisms by which prenatal PAHs will alter the
susceptibility of neonatal mice to hyperoxia. 3. To test the hypothesis that mothers exposed to
PAHs (that are present in superfund sites) are at a greater risk for preterm delivery, and that these
infants will show increased susceptibility to develop BPD than those with lesser or no exposure.
Accomplishments of these aims could lead to novel strategies for the prevention/treatment in
premature infants of BPD, which is probably potentiated by maternal PAHs that emanate from
Superfund sites."
10767769,"Disturbances in motivation are major determinants of poor functional outcome in a large number of Veterans
with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD). Motivation is defined as the orienting and energizing
impact of prospective rewards on cognition and behavior. Despite their clear public health significance,
available treatments for motivational disturbances in these serious mental illnesses (SMIs) are minimally
effective. To make progress in treatment development, a much better understanding of how different sub-
components of motivation contribute to functional impairment in these disorders is needed. In a recently
completed Merit award, we launched a translational affective neuroscience research program on motivation in
SCZ. Using behavioral and electrophysiological paradigms, we found that SCZ patients showed intact
immediate responses to rewards, but a diminished ability to use reward information to adaptively guide
behavior (e.g., decision making, cognitive control).
For this renewal, we propose to extend this translational research program in three key ways. First, we will
examine four sub-components from an affective neuroscience model of motivation that are critical for
translating information about rewards into adaptive community functioning. These components and their key
associated brain regions are: (a) Reward Receipt (ventral striatum), the immediate response to rewards, (b)
Reward anticipation (ventral striatum & orbitofrontal cortex), which refers to responsivity to reward predicting
cues, (c) Effort valuation (ventral striatum & dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), the computation of effort costs
relative to increasing reward benefits, and (d) more complex Goal-directed action selection, which involves
reciprocal capacities to energize higher level cognitive processes in response to rewards (ventral striatum) and
to effectively regulate these responses (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) to obtain valued outcomes. Second, we
will extend our methodology to include behavioral plus fMRI tasks, enabling us to more directly “dig down” into
the neural correlates of motivational disturbances. Third, we will expand beyond SCZ to also examine BPD,
another form of SMI with an opposing pattern of motivation: whereas SCZ is associated with hypo-reactivity in
certain aspects of reward processing, BPD is associated with hyper-reactivity to rewards – even in stabilized
patients who are not in an acute mood episode.
In this 4-year study, we will recruit stabilized outpatient Veterans with SCZ (n = 60) or BPD (n = 60) who are
not in a mood episode, and matched healthy controls (n = 60). Participants will complete validated fMRI
motivation tasks and corresponding behavioral motivation tasks, as well as clinical assessments of community
functioning. fMRI activation and connectivity analyses focus on a priori defined regions of interest.
Hypotheses are based on our preliminary studies and available data/theoretical models of motivation in SCZ
and BPD. Results will help specify brain-based reward-processing impairments that contribute to motivational
disturbances, and guide both clinical and preclinical studies of new treatments."

compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims
will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric

10770399,"The type II transmembrane protein Fas ligand (Fasl) was first identified as a death receptor ligand that induced
Fas+ target cells to undergo apoptosis. As such, its constitutive expression in the eye has historically been linked
to the phenomenon of immune privilege and its ability to kill activated eye-infiltrating Fas+ effector cells, or eye-infiltrating
Fas+ vascular endothelial cells. However, this notion is confounded by the fact that many non-hematopoietic
cell types in the eye, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), constitutively express Fas. In fact,
Fasl-mediated destruction of RGCs is a key factor in glaucoma pathogenesis, either by direct killing of RGCs
and/or by inducing the production of proinflammatory chemokines by Fas+ glial cells (eg. astrocytes), that recruit
proinflammatory cells to the retina and thereby causing neurotoxic inflammation. This apparent conundrum can
be explained if one accepts our hypothesis that constitutive metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of
membraned-bound Fasl (mFasL), releases a soluble fragment (sFasL) that opposes the neurotoxic activity of
mFasL. This premise is supported by preliminary data showing: (a) mice with a gene-targeted mutation of Fasl
that eliminates this Fasl cleavage site (mFaslmice) develop accelerated glaucoma in spontaneous and
inducible glaucoma models; {b} in healthy eyes, retinal Fasl is constitutively cleaved, but in glaucomatous eyes,
retinal Fasl is membrane-bound; and (c) intravitreal injection of an AAV2-sFasL vector prior to disease onset
can prevent the development of glaucoma, while injection of AAV2-sFasL after disease onset can reverse
functional defects. Together, these data point to Fasl as an important therapeutic target for patients with
glaucoma. However, a number of key questions remain unanswered and will be addressed by the proposed 3
specific aims: (Aim 1) When and how is Fasl cleavage suppressed during the development and progression of
glaucoma and how do ADAM10 and TIMP1 in regulate Fasl cleavage ?; (Aim 2) To what extent does the direct
engagement of Fas, expressed by astrocytes and/or RGCs, contribute to the development of glaucoma?; and
(Aim 3) Can sFasL directly engage Fas to elicit a protective gene expression program? Our research strategy
will involve both accepted and novel experimental tools, including (a) sortase-tagged-Fasl mice (provide by Dr.
Ploegh}, that will greatly facilitate our ability to monitor mFasL vs sFasL protein levels in the eye, {b} Fas-flexed
mice crossed to RGC- and astrocyte/muller-specific ere-deleter lines, that will allow us to identify the importance
of these cells in the development of glaucoma; (c) allophenic (tetraparental) chimeric mice made by fusing Fas+
and Fasn•9 embryos, that will allow us to distinguish direct and indirect effects of Fasl engagement in the context
of glaucoma, and {d} AAV2-sFasL vectors that will allow us to determine if sFasL functions independently of
mFasL. The mechanistic insights gained from the proposed studies are likely to reveal improved strategies for
the effective manipulation of Fas/Fasl interactions in patients afflicted with glaucoma and other ocular disorders."

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, government policy and healthcare implementation responses have been
guided by reported positivity rates and vaccination rates in the community. The selection bias of these test
data questions their validity as measures of the actual viral incidence in the community and as predictors of
clinical burden. Publicly available vaccination data are frequently cited as a proxy for population immunity, but this
metric ignores the effects of naturally-acquired immunity. The health disparities concerning asymptomatic and
symptomatic patients are not yet studied. The proposal develops a valid metric to estimate the true viral incidence
and naturally/vaccine-acquired immunity prevalence in the community, examine the health disparities and social
inequality, and monitor the epidemic over time as an operational surveillance system. The approach collects
routine testing data on SARS-CoV-2 exposure and antibody seropositivity among patients in a hospital system
and performs statistical adjustments of sample representation using multilevel regression and poststratiﬁcation
(MRP), which adjusts for measured differences between the sample and population and also yields stable small
area estimates. The data collection and analysis procedure can provide information to entire communities with
generalizability and focus on burdens within speciﬁc demographics, with close attention to vulnerable populations
on disparities across health outcomes, social determinants, and behaviors. In particular, the research will yield
group-speciﬁc estimates of disparities with respect to asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and how these
discrepancies may impact the socio-demographically dependent spread of disease and its subsequent treatment.
The MRP adjustment will be made publicly accessible via a web interface and promote broad investigations with
integrated data sources toward a national study."
10784591,"Project Summary/Abstract
Multifarious pathologies of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been studied, yet effective treatments
remain elusive. Abnormalities in motoneuron (MN) excitability remain the most tightly linked to disease path-
ogenesis. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that these abnormalities are not an epiphenomenon of
ALS, but rather an early pathophysiologic event that initiates the events leading to MN death. Paradoxically,
both MN HYPER- and HYPO-excitability changes have been seen at various disease stages, in multiple
lines of ALS mice. The lack of clarity on what roles hyper- and hypo-excitability changes play (i.e., neuropro-
tective or detrimental), and which ion channels underlie these changes, represents a critical barrier to the
development of more effective treatments. The rationale for this proposal is that understanding how hypo-
excitability mechanisms also contribute to the increasingly unstable MN environment will fill an important
gap in knowledge. The working hypotheses of this proposal are that: 1) Hyper- and hypo-excitable changes
in MN properties are not mutually exclusive, but can concurrently exist; 2) they represent fluctuations be-
tween disease and compensatory mechanisms; 3) their opposing effects cause excitability fluctuations that
are initially manageable; but then escalate in magnitude, eventually leading to MN death; and 4) under-
standing the ionic mechanisms underlying both hyper- and hypo-excitability changes can lead to drug tar-
gets for stabilization of MN excitability to prevent MN death. The hypotheses will be tested via these Aims:
Aim 1: Determine the form of motoneuronal excitability dysregulation at symptom onset, A large array of
electrical and anatomical cell properties that modulate excitability will be measured in G93A ALS mouse
MNs vs. wild-type (WT) MNs.
Aim 2: Identify the cellular mechanisms mediating MN hypo-excitability via computational modeling. High-
fidelity computer models will analyze interactions of excitability properties; then predict likely mechanisms.
Aim 3: Empirically verify model predictions of reduced Kv2.1 channel activation in MNs and cortical neurons.
Electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot experiments will assess the activation and ex-
pression levels of ion channels in ALS vs. WT MNs at four key disease stages.
If verified, these data would provide the first evidence of concurrent hypo- and hyper-excitability within MNs
in ALS, thereby providing a novel mechanism of excitability dysregulation in ALS and frontotemporal lobar
degeneration dementia (FTD)."
10784606,"Peripheral neuropathies are a common cause of disability and have no cure. The extracellular signals
that drive Schwann cell differentiation are important for peripheral nervous system myelination and are
potentially accessible to improve failure in certain human peripheral neuropathies. In previous grant
cycles, my laboratory identified essential Schwann cell signaling pathways that are modulated by
LAMININS in the extracellular matrix. Among them, RAC1, a small-RhoGTPase and YAP and TAZ,
effectors of the HIPPO pathway, are essential for normal Schwann cell development. The proposed
research will characterize how RAC1 and the HIPPO pathway intersect and identify novel components
of these pathways. The novel components include STRIATIN3 and MOB4, members of the STRIPAK
complex that we identified as novel RAC1 interactors, and the atypical cadherin CELSR2, a putative
mediator of Schwann cell-axon interactions. Preliminary data show that STRIATIN3 and CELSR2 may
be important for myelination. Furthermore, this research will identify upstream regulators of the HIPPO
pathway in Schwann cells using unbiased approaches. YAP and TAZ may also modulate human
neuropathies by mediating mechanical signals and by controlling the expression of genes such as
Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22), whose altered gene dosage causes 80% of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (CMT) cases. To determine if YAP and TAZ modulate PMP22 expression in the context of
CMT, YAP and TAZ mutants will be crossed with CMT1 models to determine if PMP22 expression and
the consequent phenotypes are modulated. This work will reveal novel fundamental regulators of two
important signaling pathways in Schwann cells. As the function of RAC1 and the HIPPO pathway is
conserved in different cell types, this work will elucidate novel aspects of cell biology, in addition to
myelination, and may reveal ways to modulate signaling pathways relevant in human neuropathies."

The goal of this work is to improve music and speech perception for cochlear implant users. The relevant health
outcome is their quality of life. This proposal focuses on how well cochlear implant users can learn to use
temporal fine structure if provided as a clear and consistent cue for music or voice pitch. Historically, cochlear
implants have discarded temporal fine structure and have only transmitted timing information of relatively slow
envelope fluctuations. Attempts have been made to restore temporal fine structure into cochlear implant
stimulation, but it is unclear whether previous attempts were limited by implementation, lack of experience, or
inherently by physiology. The proposed approach is unique in that it examines the perceptual and physiological
plasticity that occurs when temporal fine structure is restored. Proposed research is organized into two aims,
which examine the relative salience of stimulation place and rate for providing a sense of pitch (Aim 1) and the
salience of dynamic-rate stimulation compared to conventional methods (Aim 2). Both aims combine perceptual
learning, computer-controlled electrode psychophysics, electrophysiology, and computational neural modeling
to characterize the plasticity of pitch perception in cochlear implant users.
Aim 1 examines the perceptual and physiological plasticity associated with place and rate of cochlear implant
stimulation. Cochlear implant users hear an increasing pitch associated with increasing stimulation rate, but this
effect is difficult to measure above 300 Hz. Most studies of psychophysical sensitivity to cochlear implant
stimulation rate have not considered perceptual learning. Preliminary results show that the sense of pitch
provided by stimulation rate improves with training. The proposed research examines perceptual sensitivity and
physiological encoding throughout a crossover training study with training provided for pitch based on place and
rate of stimulation. The primary hypothesis tested is that cochlear implant users have a latent ability to hear pitch
associated with stimulation rate, but they require training to learn how to use this new information.
Aim 2 is to determine whether dynamic-rate stimulation provides better sensitivity and better physiological
encoding of fundamental frequency compared to conventional stimulation methods based on amplitude
modulation of constant-rate stimulation. In normal physiology, auditory-nerve activity phase locks to the temporal
fine structure of sound. Since cochlear implants typically discard this information, it is unknown how well cochlear
implant users can learn to use it if provided. Aim 2 focuses on the comparison between dynamic-rate stimulation
in which stimulation rate is dynamically adjusted to convey temporal fine structure compared to conventional
methods based on amplitude modulation of constant-rate stimulation. The primary hypothesis is that dynamic-
rate stimulation provides better pitch sensitivity and better physiological encoding compared to amplitude
modulation of constant-rate stimulation."

The ability to translate sensory experiences into action is essential for our survival. Despite its importance in
health and disease, we know remarkably little about how we assign meaning to and use sensory stimuli to
guide behavior. The dorsal striatum is thought to be particularly important for the formation of sensorimotor
associations during reinforcement learning due to the dopaminergic inputs it receives, as well as a diverse
array of cortical and subcortical inputs. There are two cell types that make up the two output pathways of the
dorsal striatum, direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs) and indirect pathway striatal neurons
(iSPNs). While much work has focused on how these pathways might function to initiate movements, very little
is known about how sensory learning influences the neuronal activity of these neurons and what effect this has
on behavior.
 The experiments that make up this proposal provide a framework for understanding how sensory input
shapes the activity of dSPNs and iSPNs in the dorsal striatum. In this proposal, we focus on a specific part of
the dorsal striatum known as the auditory striatum (AudStr), that receives dense auditory inputs. We
hypothesize that auditory sensorimotor learning enables the formation of cue-specific ensembles that correlate
with and predict motor output. We expect that these changes will be primarily driven by synaptic plasticity of
inputs that converge onto SPNs, rather than changes to their intrinsic excitability.
 We will perform two independent, inter-related aims to test this hypothesis. We will train mice on a task
that requires them to associate a 'go' cue with a specified action to receive a reward, and to suppress this
action in response to a 'no-go' cue. In Aim 1, we will employ longitudinal calcium imaging of AudStr neurons to
characterize the outputs of these neurons to cues before and after learning. In Aim 2, we will explore the
cellular mechanisms underlying anticipated changes in population activity that results from learning, and aim to
demonstrate the importance of synaptic plasticity in the AudStr to this process. In both aims we will employ
methods that enable us to identify neurons as dSPNs and iSPNs. This is crucial because a major outstanding
question in this field is whether these cell types play opposing or complementary roles in producing appropriate
motor responses. Overall, this work will lay the groundwork for a new conceptual model for understanding
how sensory learning influences striatal activity to control behavior."

The goal of this project is to create a novel immunotherapeutic drug candidate against ovarian cancer (OVCA).
OVCA is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy in the United States, with poor survival rates
due to late diagnosis and chemo-resistant, fatal recurrent disease after the first-line debulking surgery and
chemotherapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have thus far failed to show a significant clinical benefit due to
highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and poor infiltration of T cells. Thus, the development of
effective OVCA immunotherapy requires novel strategies. To address this problem, the proposed project will
create novel immunotherapeutic proteins based on Avaren lectin. It is a small, 14-kDa recombinant protein
engineered in the PI’s laboratory from a natural actinomycete lectin, which selectively recognizes a cluster of
high-mannose glycans that are prevalent on the surface of enveloped viruses and malignant cells. A fusion
protein consisting of Avaren lectin and human IgG1 Fc (AvFc) was previously shown to exhibit potent antiviral
and antitumor activities without toxicity in in vitro and in vivo animal models. Based on growing evidence
indicating that high-mannose overaccumulation also occurs on the surface of OVCA cells, we hypothesize that
Avaren lectin can be utilized in novel OVCA-targeting strategies. Our preliminary data show that AvFc efficiently
binds to OVCA but not to adjacent normal tissues. AvFc elicited potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC) against OVCA cell lines. Furthermore, AvFc treatment exhibited moderate yet statistically
significant efficacy extending the survival of animals in a syngeneic, orthotopic murine OVCA model using the
ID8 cell line. Building on these data, in this project we will create immunostimulatory variants of Avaren lectin
that can transform OVCA into more immunologically hot tumors, thereby exhibiting potent immunotherapeutic
efficacy. Specifically, we will engineer translational fusion proteins consisting of Avaren lectin / AvFc and an
antitumor cytokine (“lectikines”). In Aim 1, we will generate lectikines by fusing a variant of IL-2 devoid of CD25
binding (IL-2v) or IL-15 to AvFc, which will be produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a transient
overexpression system. After thorough purification, we will assess their molecular properties, OVCA cell-binding
affinity and cytokine functions in a battery of biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays. In Aim 2, we will
evaluate the therapeutic effects of lectikines in comparison with AvFc in a murine ID8 OVCA model. Disease
progression will be monitored through abdomen circumference, body weight, and live animal bioluminescence
imaging. Immunophenotyping of peritoneal cells will be performed by flow cytometry. We anticipate that lectikines
will elicit significant efficacy through increased immune activation in the tumor microenvironment. Successful
completion of this pilot project will establish an initial proof-of-concept and generate a compelling data set for
further investigation and development of a first-in-class OVCA immunotherapy."

humans is in the range of 30-100 micrograms. The biotin market is divided between agricultural
and human use with 90% and 10% going to animal and human nutrition respectively. Currently
biotin is produced by chemical synthesis at the level of >20 tons/year. Biotin biosynthesis is
well-understood and efforts to produce it by fermentation are currently under intense
investigation in several biotechnology companies. Biotin functions as a cofactor in all
biochemical carboxylation reactions involving bicarbonate as the CO2 donor. The mechanism of
biotin mediated carboxylation is now well-understood. Biotin has also found extensive
applications in chemical biology where the strong biotin avidin interaction has been extensively
used for macromolecular tagging.
 In contrast to biotin biosynthesis, little is known about biotin catabolism. A few products of
biotin catabolism in a soil Pseudomonad grown on biotin as the sole carbon source have been
isolated but no genes or enzymes associated with biotin catabolism have yet been identified.
 This proposal will focus on the isolation of a biotin catabolic strain, the identification of the
catabolic operon and the reconstitution of all enzymes involved in biotin catabolism. Mechanistic
and structural studies will be carried out on the key enzymes involved in the degradation of the
biotin heterocyclic core."

Cluster trials are the study design of choice when interventions are best applied at the group level and when
exposure of one individual may affect the outcomes of other individuals in the same cluster. Cluster trials are
increasingly embedded within large health care systems, allowing the use of routinely collected data to
increase research efficiency. There is concern, however – and this proposal provides supportive evidence –
that randomized clusters are not representative the target populations seen in routine care. When treatment
effects vary over factors that influence trial participation, treatment effects from the trial cannot be directly
applied to real-world target populations of substantive interest. Thus, even in well-designed cluster trials,
selective participation can lead to bias in drawing causal inferences about the target population. Given the
increasing number of cluster trials being conducted, investigators need rigorous methods for generalizing
findings from cluster trials to target populations that address selective participation bias and can account for
multiple data science challenges, including stochastic dependence among observations in the same cluster;
availability of randomized trial data from only a few clusters or from clusters with relatively small sample sizes;
lack of knowledge of predictors of trial participation and the outcome, when candidate covariates often exceed
the number of available clusters and necessitate the use of flexible machine learning approaches; and missing
outcome data. In response to Notice of Special Interest NOT-LM-19-003, we propose novel, domain-
independent, reusable causal and statistical methods to address these data-science challenges and to
increase the ability of cluster trials to inform clinical and policy decisions by eliminating bias due to selective
participation when estimating average treatment effects and when estimating the optimal covariate-dependent
treatment strategy. We will evaluate the methods in realistic simulation studies and in empirical analyses using
data from 3 large-scale cluster trials of influenza vaccination strategies in U.S. nursing homes."

Emerging evidence indicates that women are more likely to use a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) for
pregnancy and HIV/STI infection prevention than a product for pregnancy or HIV/STI infection prevention. The
MPT development space is dominated by products that contain one or more hormonal contraceptives, which
many women, including breastfeeding women, cannot or will not use. Amphora gel is an exception. Ampphora
is a non-hormonal, vaginally-acting contraceptive product for women being developed by Evofem Biosciences
Inc. It works by maintaining a low vaginal pH that is hostile to sperm, bacteria, and viruses. Evofem recently
completed a Phase 3 contraceptive efficacy trial of Amphora that indicated typical use efficacy of 86.0% and per
protocol efficacy (perfect use) of 98.7%, comparable to the efficacy of the most commonly used forms of
hormonal contraception, oral pills. Amphora is currently being tested in Phase 2b trials for prevention of
urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea in women and preparing for trials for prevention of recurrent bacterial
vaginosis (BV), which has completed enrollment. QGRFT is a stable analog of the non-antiretroviral (non-ARV)
anti-HIV lectin griffithsin (GRFT). We completed a Phase 1 trial of a vaginally administered GRFT gel, and
with PATH developed a novel vaginally administered GRFT fast dissolving insert (FDI) that significantly
prevented simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in macaques and HSV-2 and HPV infection in
mice. Our long term goal is to develop an Amphora/QGRFT FDI for adolescent girls and a wide range of women,
including breastfeeding women, which provides non-hormonal contraception and reduces the risk of acquiring a
broad range of viral and bacterial STIs. Herein we will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and in vivo efficacy of two
innovative MPT prototypes: an Amphora/QGRFT FDI that could have contraceptive and anti-HIV/STI/BV
properties and an Amphora-only FDI that could have contraceptive and anti-STI/BV properties. The
prototypes will be manufactured and then evaluated in a series of in vitro assays, physiochemical
property/stability evaluations, and in vivo studies to demonstrate FDI disintegration, drug retention in the vagina,
safety, anti-HIV activity (pharmacodynamics studies in a macaque model and in vivo efficacy in macaques) and
anti-HSV-2 activity (murine model). The Amphora/QGFRT FDI may offer more potent anti-HSV-2 activity than
Amphora alone due to QGRFT’s anti-HSV-2 activity. Using data obtained in these studies, we will select one FDI
to advance into contraceptive efficacy testing in rabbits and IND-enabling toxicology studies in rats. The novel
non-hormonal FDI proposed here could (i) eliminate side effects associated with hormonal contraceptives, (ii)
meet the needs of women who have infrequent sex or who are breastfeeding, and (iii) reduce the sexual
acquitision of HIV/STIs and the emergence of ARV-resistant HIV. This woman-initiated FDI has the potential to
improve women’s health and advance the MPT field. When approved, the FDI would be the first non-hormonal,
on-demand and event-driven MPT with both contraceptive and broad spectrum anti/HIV/STI properties."

One in three seniors dies with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or another dementia - diseases that cost the nation $259 billion, to rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050 (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017). Despite the vast personal and economic cost of these diseases, two major barriers stall efforts to discover key biological mechanisms that influence brain aging. First, the sheer cost of data collection means that most national initiatives have limited power to detect factors that affect brain aging. Even in datasets of N=1,000+ people (e.g., ADNI) – the power to discover modulators of brain aging is limited and may not generalize worldwide. Second, with the crisis of reproducibility, we do not always know if a finding will replicate; and if not, if this is due to true population heterogeneity or problems with methods. ENIGMA offers a coordinated global approach to solve these problems. ENIGMA’s World Aging Center is a global brain aging study that builds on our vast and highly productive ENIGMA consortium - a global network of 340 institutions in 45 countries. ENIGMA published the largest-ever genetic studies of the brain (Nature 2017; Science 2020), and the largest neuroimaging studies of 5 major psychiatric disorders. ENIGMA’s World Aging Center is a concerted global effort to pool all available data, methods, expertise and capital infrastructure to discover factors that affect brain aging. Our long-term goal is to identify personalized biological predictors of brain structural and functional decline and assess how they generalize globally. We have 4 aims: Aim 1: ENIGMA-Lifespan. Develop Lifespan Charts for Brain and Neural Tract Aging in 20,000 people. We will create charts showing how MRI brain measures change throughout life in 20,000 people, aged 1-92. We will compute a composite brain aging score, ‘Brain Age’, from available MRI, DTI, rsFMRI data, that measures how much the brain deviates from expected values, for a person’s age and sex. Aim 2: ENIGMA-Epigenetics. Relate genome-wide methylation levels to brain metrics in 10,000+ people, to discover epigenetic markers of accelerated brain aging. We discovered 2 epigenetic loci promoting brain aging in pilot studies. We will compute a “epigenetic clock” and test if it predicts brain metrics better than simple biological age. Aim 3: ENIGMA-Plasticity. Discover genomic loci that promote or mitigate brain tissue loss, in > 37 worldwide cohorts with longitudinal MRI. Aim 4: ENIGMA-Alzheimer’s Disease (New Aim). Meta-analyze the role of APOE, AD polygenic risk, and a new risk score for accelerated atrophy on neuroimaging biomarkers in aging and AD, including amyloid and FDG PET. These aims seek to analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods. We aim to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and epigenome, test how and when they shift AD biomarkers, and test their generalizability worldwide."

Despite decades of research, Plasmodium falciparum malaria continues to kill hundreds of thousands of children
in sub-Saharan Africa each year. Vulnerability to severe malaria is complex, involving both host and parasite
factors. Blood type A is an established risk factor for severe malaria, whereas blood type O is associated with
protection from complicated symptoms. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon is incompletely understood
but may involve interactions mediated by particular parasite antigens. RIFINs and STEVORs are highly diverse
parasite protein families that are displayed on the surface of infected red blood cells. Recent laboratory studies
suggest that these antigens may exacerbate malaria severity through multiple mechanisms, including adherence
to nearby red blood cells to form “rosettes” that envelop the parasite and protect it from immune clearance.
Certain RIFINs bind preferentially to type A red blood cells. STEVORs have a similar binding preference for
glycophorin C, another red blood cell surface protein. These intriguing findings suggest that RIFINs and
STEVORs may be central to P. falciparum virulence and drive differences in susceptibility to severe disease
between blood types. Despite promising in vitro links to severe malaria vulnerability, the immense
diversity of the RIFIN and STEVOR families has so far precluded the comprehensive study of these
antigens in clinical infections. The goal of this proposal is to identify RIFIN and STEVOR subtypes that are
associated with severe malaria in African children. We will obtain blood and serum samples from children with
severe or non-severe malaria in Mali, Malawi, and Uganda, representing three regions of sub-Saharan Africa
with distinct malaria transmission patterns. In Aim 1, we will identify the expressed rif and stevor transcripts in
individual blood samples using reference-free RNA-Seq, then compare the abundance of transcript subgroups
between severe and non-severe malaria. In Aim 2, we will profile antibody responses against a comprehensive
microarray of RIFIN and STEVOR variants to identify immune “gaps” in children with severe malaria compared
to non-severe malaria. RIFIN and STEVOR antigen subtypes that were preferentially expressed and/or not
serorecognized in severe malaria infections may be important mediators of pathogenesis. RIFINs that
predominate in severe cases with blood type A may be critical aspects of this group’s vulnerability. The proposed
aims will help clarify the role of RIFINs and STEVORs in severe malaria pathogenesis and inform the
development of tailored vaccines and therapeutics to protect the most at-risk children in sub-Saharan Africa. The
applicant will develop and apply hands-on skills in transcriptomics, immunoepidemiology, and international
clinical research design and management, critical to his intended career as a 21st century molecular
epidemiologist."

The United States (US) is currently experiencing among the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) on record, and women who use drugs are disproportionately affected. Drug use contributes to sexual
risk behaviors, but there has been little examination of the role of drug treatment in preventing STIs among
women who use drugs. The “drug treatment as disease prevention” paradigm has been applied to viral
infections primarily transmitted via blood (i.e., HIV, HCV), and studies conducted mostly among men who inject
drugs have found that drug treatment reduces HIV/HCV risk likely by reducing drug use and unsterile injection.
However, the relationship between drug treatment and risk of STIs among the broader population of women
who use drugs (e.g., those who do and do not inject) is underexplored. The mechanisms through which drug
treatment may affect STI risk are unknown and elucidating them could identify novel intervention approaches.
Finally, a range of individual, social, and structural factors drive inequities in access to drug treatment and STI
risk, independently and together with race/ethnicity, and may lead to heightened vulnerability within specific
groups of women. In the proposed secondary data analysis study, we will create an analytic sample of women
who use drugs (n=842) using data from Project AWARE (NIDA-CTN-AWARE), which was a prospective study
of men and women seeking care at US STD clinics. We will evaluate whether baseline drug treatment is
associated with cumulative STI incidence measured at six months follow up (Aim 1). Using causal mediation
analyses, we will evaluate mediation of the link between drug treatment and STI incidence by substance use,
sexual behavior, and STI/HIV testing uptake among women who use drugs (Aim 2). We will identify potential
differences in associations between drug treatment and STI incidence and the mediating pathways by
individual (e.g., age, mental health), social (e.g., marital status), and structural (e.g., housing instability,
healthcare access) factors (Aim 3). Across aims, we will explore differences in the associations and potential
mediating pathways by race/ethnicity among women who use drugs, and compare effects observed among
women to effects observed among men who use drugs. Research on intersections among drug treatment and
sexual and reproductive health among women is scarce, but represents a critical aspect of addressing the
specific needs of women who use drugs. The proposed study is highly responsive to NIH’s special interest in
advancing research specific to women and will directly address the topics that cut across NIDA’s goals,
including identifying approaches to reduce health inequities and understand interactions between drug use and
co-occurring medical consequences."

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Currently, echocardiography
(i.e., ultrasound imaging of the heart) is the standard-of-care for optimal assessment and measurement of patient
heart function. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography are commonly used in hospitalized
patients, but they have limitations. Transthoracic echocardiography is non-invasive but data is only collected
while the probe is manually positioned on the patient's chest, which may result in missing important changes in
a patient's clinical course
and windows for potential intervention. Transesophageal echocardiography provides
real-time measurement of different indices of cardiac function, but requires general anesthesia or deep sedation.
To address these limitations, this proposed project aims to develop a wearable ultrasonic imager for continuous,
non-invasive monitoring of cardiac functions in real-time via a transthoracic approach. Based on our previous
work in wearable ultrasound blood pressure and flow sensors, the proposed device will utilize a stretchable
ultrasonic device with reduced transducer element pitch, enabled by a multilayered, highly stretchable and highly
integrated liquid metal electrode. The small pitch allows high transducer frequency and thus enhanced imaging
performance. The device will be designed to monitor the heart in two orthogonal planes simultaneously and will
use associated algorithms for B-mode imaging. To map the transducer locations on the dynamic human body,
we will use shape sensing multicore optical fibers to acquire the exact coordinates of each transducer and use
these location data for beamforming
. We will use the wide-beam compounding transmission strategy, which can
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of ultrasound signals and therefore overall imaging performance of the device.
The results will be benchmarked against those from a clinical ultrasound probe. We will construct a deep learning
model based on Fully Convolutional Networks to process the acquired cardiac images automatically. We will
extract the left ventricular wall motion waveforms and left ventricular volume, from which critical indices, such as
stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output, can be generated continuously. The performance of the
device will be evaluated on a commercial phantom and tested on human subjects. After verifying the safety of
the proposed device, we will use it to collect the cardiac images from 138 healthy and patient subjects. The
accuracy of the results collected by the proposed device will be compared and analyzed statistically with that
obtained by a clinical-grade ultrasound machine. Our team is composed of highly interdisciplinary expertise that
is required for the success of the proposed research. If successful, this technology has the potential to
significantly improve cardiovascular monitoring and open new use cases for monitoring other critical visceral
organ, which will exert a sustained and powerful impact on many NIH-related research areas s."

Food intake generates a succession of sensory signals that feedback to regulate appetite. These include the
sight and smell of food; its taste and texture; and the detection of volume and chemical composition in the GI
tract. While the function of these signals has long been studied at the level of behavior, we know little about
how they are integrated in the neural circuits that control hunger and satiety. Here we propose to identify
principles by which sensory feedback during a meal is integrated in the hindbrain to control feeding behavior.
In Aim 1 we investigate motivational and circuit mechanisms by brainstem circuits regulate the consummatory
phase of food intake. In Aim 2, we characterize the role of descending projections from the forebrain. In Aim 3,
we test the hypothesis that local circuits in the brainstem gate the flow of sensory information arising from
different organs. Together, these experiments will reveal how the brain integrates diverse ingestive signals to
enable the moment-by-moment control of feeding behavior"

Hospital-acquired infections are a major threat to public health, impacting 2 million patients and causing at
least 90,000 deaths annually. Sepsis is a common complication in patients with hospital-acquired infections
and the leading cause of death in non-cardiac intensive care units (ICU). Attempts at treating hospital-acquired
infections and sepsis have proven exceedingly difficult and patients that survive sepsis suffer long-term
physical and cognitive disabilities and a high 1-year mortality rate. Therefore, new strategies are needed to
decrease the burden of hospital-acquired infections and sepsis. Immunotherapy aimed at inducing
innate immune memory provides a way of achieving that goal. Recent studies show that innate immune
cells can retain memory of prior pathogen exposure and are primed to elicit a robust, broad-spectrum
antimicrobial response to subsequent infection. Treatment with TLR4 ligands, such as monophosphoryl lipid A
(MPLA), confers innate immune memory and resistance to a broad array of clinically important pathogens that
persists for more than 2 weeks. We propose that the appropriate application of TLR4 ligand-based
immunotherapy to induce innate immune memory has significant potential to reduce the burden of
hospital-acquired infections and sepsis. Macrophages are the foundation for development of innate
immune memory. Recent evidence indicates that remodeling of macrophage metabolism is central to the
induction of innate immune memory. Priming with TLR4 ligands induces a macrophage metabolic phenotype
characterized by increased glycolysis, oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis with increased citric
acid cycle flux and associated increases in immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1) expression and itaconate
production. We hypothesize that macrophage metabolic remodeling and the increased production of
Irg1 and itaconate are essential to generating innate immune memory. To define the underlying biology,
we will: (1). Determine how Irg1 and itaconate drive TLR4 agonist-induced innate immune memory in
macrophages; (2). Define the importance of Irg1, itaconate and Nrf2 as regulators of the host response to
infection with common hospital-acquired pathogens after TLR4 agonist treatment in vivo.; (3). Define the
intracellular signaling pathways driving mitochondrial biogenesis, Irg1 expression and itaconate production in
TLR4 agonist-primed macrophages; (4). Determine the ability of diverse microbial ligands to induce
macrophage mitochondrial biogenesis, reprogram mitochondrial metabolism and function and induce innate
immune memory. We will test the hypothesis that, like TLR4 agonists, microbial ligands such as peptidoglycan,
CpG ODN and β-glucan, have the ability to reprogram macrophage metabolism and induce a memory
phenotype characterized by mitochondrial biogenesis, increased citric acid cycle flux, increased Irg1
expression and itaconate production with associated enhancement of antimicrobial functions."

Women show a heightened risk for psychosis in midlife that is not observed in men. The menopausal transition
(i.e., perimenopause) is presumed to account for these midlife changes in risk, but data examining this
possibility are wholly lacking. Information on mechanisms of midlife risk is largely absent as well. Ovarian
hormones are key to menopausal changes in women and are known to have wide-reaching effects on brain
and behavior. Thus, it has been theorized that changes in these hormones during perimenopause drive midlife
psychosis risk in women, and studies during other reproductive events (e.g., the menstrual cycle) show
increased psychotic symptoms in women with lower levels of ovarian hormones. However, to date, no studies
have examined if changes in ovarian hormones are mechanisms of midlife psychosis risk in women.
Consequently, the Specific Aims of the proposed project are to isolate the perimenopausal period as a critical
period of risk (Aim 1) and examine ovarian hormones as mechanisms of effects (Aim 2). We will address
these aims using an innovative, multi-method (behavioral, neuroendocrine, multi-informant), and intensive daily
study design in a large, population-based sample of women (N = 750) that varies in menopausal status (i.e.,
premenopause, perimenopause, postmenopause) and is enriched for psychosis risk. Women will collect daily
data on psychotic (and related) symptoms across 35 consecutive days, and we will use these data to confirm
that perimenopausal stage, rather than age or other factors (e.g., midlife stress), drive increased psychosis risk
in women (Aim 1). We will then extend these data by collecting daily saliva samples of estrogen and
progesterone across the 35-day study period in the perimenopausal women and examining whether levels and
changes in these hormones are mechanisms underlying midlife psychosis risk in women (Aim 2). We will
assess a range of psychotic symptoms across the study period to capture the full spectrum of psychosis risk,
and we will collect informant and clinician symptom ratings to validate and confirm symptom reports.
Importantly, our proposed study addresses the RFA high priority area “Research clarifying the mechanistic
role of reproductive steroids in generating, moderating, or mitigating mood and psychosis symptoms
during the menopausal transition.” Indeed, our novel, longitudinal study will allow us to quantify population-
level risk for midlife psychosis as well as elucidate the critical hormonal mechanisms that are necessary to
inform women's health policy and devise translational approaches to prevention and intervention."
10771678,"Abstract
Allostatic load, which is characterized by the dysregulation of physiological activity across multiple systems in
the body, has been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
However, the prevalence of allostatic load is not equally distributed among US subgroups, with Black adults
having higher allostatic load than White adults, particularly during middle and older age. The reasons for these
disparities are not fully understood, despite research into factors such as stressors, diet, and socioeconomic
position. Discrimination has been identified as a risk factor for allostatic load. While discrimination is
understood as a multidimensional construct that operates at multiple levels and in different social contexts, the
association between multiple forms of discrimination and allostatic load remains understudied, as well as the
underlying mechanisms by which discrimination may affect physiological function. The cellular-level processes
through which discrimination ""gets under the skin"" and leads to physiological dysregulation remain unclear.
This study aims to define the relationship between multiple forms of discrimination and allostatic load using
data from three large, population-based cohort studies, in order to increase the efficacy of prevention efforts
and treatment to reduce allostatic load and Black-White disparities in allostatic load. By assessing the
associations between multiple forms of discrimination (neighborhood and interpersonal) with allostatic load, the
study will quantify the extent to which discrimination explains racial disparities in allostatic load. The study will
also investigate the extent to which ""Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity"" (CTRA) gene
expression mediates the relationship between discrimination and allostatic load, as well as evaluate the
moderating effect of social integration on these associations. Overall, this study has the potential to inform the
optimization of existing clinical and place-based interventions aimed at reducing allostatic load by highlighting
the importance of addressing discrimination and identifying the timing, context, and most at-risk groups that
can benefit from these interventions to reduce health disparities."
10783753,"A craniotomy is performed to access the brain for procedures that include tumor resection, localization and
resection of epileptogenic foci, and aneurysm clipping, where the bone flap is replaced intraoperatively. Despite
prophylaxis, infectious complications after craniotomy range from 1-3%, with approximately half caused by
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which forms a biofilm on the bone flap that is recalcitrant to antibiotics. We
have developed a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection that shares important ultrastructural, MRI, and
immune attributes with human disease, which can be exploited to identify mechanisms for infection persistence.
Our preliminary results suggest that T cells maintain S. aureus in a biofilm state to minimize the shedding of
planktonic bacteria into the brain. Ultimately, this helps protect the CNS parenchyma but does not clear the
biofilm. This is supported by the fact that bacterial burden was unchecked in Rag1 KO mice and in WT animals
following CD4+ T cell depletion, reflecting increased planktonic bacteria in the brain and galea. Furthermore, T
cell loss coincided with an attenuated activation signature in microglia, macrophages, and granulocytes, with
significant reductions in several IFN-ɣ-regulated genes, including CXCL10, indicative of T cell-innate immune
crosstalk. We aim to understand this regulation in addition to T cell-biofilm crosstalk to devise novel strategies
to promote biofilm eradication. This possibility is feasible given our innovative bacterial scRNA-seq data, where
activated CD4+ T cells induced the expression of several S. aureus virulence genes, including protein A (spa)
that binds the Fc portion of antibody to inhibit opsonophagocytosis. CXCL10 has been reported to induce Spa
shedding from the bacterial membrane, which raises the intriguing possibility that CXCL10 induction by T cells
promotes Spa release to block S. aureus phagocytosis, which is supported by our preliminary data where
craniotomy infection was significantly reduced with a S. aureus spa mutant. This proposal will examine the
hypothesis that CD4+ T cells regulate antimicrobial responses in the brain and galea by targeting
microglia/macrophages vs. PMNs/G-MDSCs, respectively, to prevent bacterial outgrowth and limit invasion into
the brain. In response, S. aureus alters its transcriptiome to augment virulence factor expression to promote
biofilm persistence. This represents a host-pathogen triad that dictates infection outcome and the molecular
mechanisms responsible for bacterial persistence in the brain and galea will be examined in the following
Specific Aims: 1) Identify the critical CD4+ Th subset and antigen specificity in controlling S. aureus outgrowth
during craniotomy infection; 2) Determine key mechanisms of T cell-innate immune crosstalk that dictate biofilm
growth and CNS invasion; and 3) Identify S. aureus biofilm genes that are critical for subverting T cell effector
function during craniotomy infection. An improved understanding of how T cells shape the innate immune
landscape and S. aureus virulence during craniotomy infection may be leveraged to enhance antimicrobial
activity and biofilm clearance to reduce patient morbidity."
10783789,"Background: High-grade gliomas are among the leading cause of cancer-related death in children, with
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) being a highly lethal subtype. DIPG commonly exhibits a mutation in
histone H3, referred to as H3K27M, which leads to gliomagenesis. However, the cell signaling events that
promote DIPG growth are not fully understood. We have discovered and recently shown that DIPGs are reliant
on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) for proliferation and survival. However, several critical
knowledge gaps of ERK5 function in DIPG remain. We will use an innovative syngeneic DIPG model in
combination with well-established models of DIPG to address several questions in this proposal. Specifically,
we hypothesize that ERK5 promotes growth through both glioma intrinsic effects and pro-glioma activities of
select glioma associated microglia and macrophages (GAMs). Significance: To support our preliminary data
and test our hypothesis we will study the role of ERK5 in three aims. Aim 1: Revealing functions of ERK5 in
GAMs and the importance of paracrine signaling with DIPG cells will provide valuable knowledge potentially
applicable to the development of new therapeutic modalities. Aim 2: Building a new paradigm by
understanding the dynamic characteristics of targeting multiple ERK pathways. Aim 3: ERK5 contains both a
transactivation domain and kinase domain unlike all other ERKs. Here we will delineate the functional role of
these domains and their contribution to glioma growth. Impact. This project leverages unique in vivo and in
vitro model systems to study a highly aggressive brain tumor. Our research will inform molecular mechanisms
and translational relevance of ERK5 in brain tumors, and be broadly applicable to other types of cancer and
neurosciences."
10783754,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 40% of children with epilepsy do not respond to available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and identifying genes
for outcome and AED response will provide critical insight into underlying pathways. Genotyping can readily be
performed on tens of thousands of patients, but phenotyping remains a largely manual task. Electronic medical
records (EMR) have been implemented over the last two decades. This readily available data source has enabled
large studies linking EMR and biorepositories to identify novel disease genes. However, EMR data have not
been used in epilepsy genetic studies so far. The long-term goal is to better understand how genetic changes in
childhood epilepsies predict specific phenotypes, medication responses, and outcomes. The overall objective of
this study is to detect genetic risk factors by utilizing EMR data to identify new biological mechanisms. The central
hypothesis is that while the complexity of the age-related clinical patterns of the childhood epilepsies creates a
major obstacle in generating universally applicable phenotyping algorithms, alternative methods leveraging the
similarity of the clinical disease course and medication trajectory can be used to identify causative genetic
variants associated with outcome and AED response. The rationale of this study is that understanding the genetic
contribution for outcome and AED response will translate into personalized medication choices, early
identification of patients at risk for a more severe outcome, and elucidation of novel biological pathways for
therapy development. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. As a first aim, this
study will determine genetic factors associated with a similar longitudinal disease course. Preliminary data
demonstrates that applying computational methods to determine the similarity of phenotypes enable the
identification of novel genetic etiologies. This study will analyze EMR-derived longitudinal phenotypes in 2,500
individuals with available genetic data and identify genetic etiologies with related disease trajectories. As a
second aim, this study aims to identify genetic factors that influence AED trajectories. AED response is not easily
extracted from EMR datasets. However, longitudinal AED histories between patients can be compared, which
may indicate biologically determined shared response patterns. This study will test whether patients with rare
variants in shared genes have longitudinal AED trajectories that are more similar than expected by chance,
highlighting empirical treatment patterns that may indicate gene-specific AED responses. This approach is
innovative, as it leverages EMR as a ubiquitous, easily accessible, but previously unexamined data source in
order to identify novel genetic risk factors in childhood epilepsies. The proposed research is significant as it is
expected to expand understanding of genetic risk factors for outcome and AED response, which was previously
not possible due to limited phenotypic data. This proposal extends the prior experience of the applicant to large,
integrated cohort studies and provides invaluable training for a planned R01 application in in Year 3 of this award."
10773307,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Longitudinal bone growth takes place in the growth plate (GP), where chondrocytes proliferate, synthesize
extracellular matrix, and differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes. During puberty, the energy requirements
of chondrocytes are increased due to their rapid proliferation and extensive matrix production, and inadequate
energy supply as in malnutrition causes growth failure. Due to its avascular and hypoxic environment, it has
been thought that the GP uses little lipids for fuel because lipid metabolism, such as fatty acid oxidation (FAO),
requires oxygen. Instead, anaerobic glycolysis is thought to be the primary source of energy. On the other
hand, diseases that affect lipid metabolism such as peroxisomal disorders and lipid storage disorders also
cause short stature, raising the possibility that lipids may play an important role in the GP. However, lipid
metabolism in the GP is poorly understood. Although the GP is avascular, it is flanked by two bone marrow
cavities, and the upper and lower zones which are the resting and hypertrophic zones, respectively, are
adjacent to blood vessels, suggesting that these zones have access to oxygen and nutrients in the circulating
blood. Indeed, our preliminary studies have shown that the resting zone contains many lipid droplets (LDs).
When fluorescently labeled lipids were injected intravenously, these lipids were observed in the resting zone
within a few hours but disappeared within 24 hours, suggesting that chondrocytes in the resting zone actively
capture and consume lipids from circulation. Consistently, lipidomic analysis of cultured primary chondrocytes
detected Acyl-Carnitines, FA derivatives generated for FAO. Together with the recent finding that inhibition of
mitochondrial oxidation in GP chondrocytes resulted in short limbs, these results suggest that GP
chondrocytes are capable of utilizing lipids for energy production via FAO. In addition, we found that these
chondrocytes containing LDs in the resting zone exclusively expressed Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid
transporter. ApoE conditional knockout (KO) mice in chondrocytes had significantly shorter limbs. Lipidomic
analysis of ApoE KO chondrocytes revealed altered lipid profiles compared to WT chondrocytes. These results
suggest that ApoE endogenously expressed in chondrocytes plays an important role in bone growth and lipid
metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesize that GP chondrocytes utilize lipids as an energy source and intrinsic
ApoE in the resting chondrocytes mediates the initial lipid metabolism. This hypothesis will be addressed with
the following Aims: (1) to determine whether the growth plate utilizes lipids as an energy source, (2) to identify
the role of endogenous ApoE in the growth plate. Completion of these Aims will determine whether GP
chondrocytes utilize FAO in vivo and whether this has biological significance. The outcome will revolutionize
our understanding of energy metabolism in the GP."
10764630,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Changes in physiological stimuli reprogram the translation machinery to alter preferential recruitment of
mRNAs to the ribosome and which start site on a mRNA is selected. Genome wide analysis using
ribosome profiling has revealed far more extensive regulation of these events than previously appreciated,
yet the mechanism of mRNA recruitment and its regulation remains poorly understood. This knowledge
gap persists mainly because of difficulties in determining which intermediate step(s) in the initiation
pathway function as kinetic checkpoints to control mRNA recruitment. To date, initiation pathway
intermediates have largely been identified on the basis of their thermodynamic stability which must
withstand traditional assays (e.g. sucrose gradients and immunoprecipitations). These approaches take
minutes to hours to perform, and/or require cross-linking agents to stabilize them, but most intermediates
prior to initiation codon selection occur on the sub-second to second time scale. To determine how
mRNAs are selected for translation, one must develop and use assays that can precisely monitor the
formation of pathway intermediates in real-time. To overcome this bottleneck and move the field forward,
we have developed innovative ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence-based assays that can
monitor the rate of mRNA recruitment to the ribosome in real-time. Our highly purified reconstituted
system will enable us to successfully test and build models with which to understand mRNA recruitment
and its regulation. Models that we generate will be tested using translation assays in cell-free extracts and
intact cells. Our long-term objective is to understand the mechanism by which alterations in initiation factor
availability and their post-translational modification reprograms the translational apparatus to control
which mRNAs are translated in response to physiological stimuli."
11080438,"ABSTRACT
Healthcare safety and regulatory systems are limited by the quality of the data used to guide decision making;
efforts to fully realize health equity across ethnicity, race, age, disability, and geography, will be accelerated by
data that best measures and captures the health of all Americans and the contexts in which they receive their
care. Similar to challenges in equitable clinical trial recruitment, minoritized populations, older populations, rural
populations and persons with disabilities have been underrepresented in the real-world data that are
increasingly used for studies of drug and device safety and efficacy. To address these challenges, as noted in
our application and in responding to the barriers to health equity addressed in U01 RFA-FD-23-009, our overall
research objectives are twofold. First, we will evaluate the delivery of guideline concordant care for COVID-19
using data obtained from the American Board of Family Medicine’s PRIME Registry. These include longitudinal
data since 2016 on nearly eight million primary care patients from small independent clinics across the U.S.
The patients are diverse geographically and socially, including patients living in all 50 states and over half of
the ZIP codes in the U.S. Our approach will build on a three-year collaboration between Stanford University
and the American Board of Family Medicine to curate the PRIME Registry data for regulatory use and
transform them into a research dataset, the American Family Cohort (AFC). Despite representing the bulk of
care, data from primary care is notably absent in much of the current real-world data landscape as much of the
data used for federally funded research comes from academic medical centers which focus on inpatient,
tertiary and quaternary care. Second, we propose to enhance the AFC data through the development and
application of methods to better capture data relevant to health equity analyses from electronic medical records
such as race, ethnicity, geography and social circumstances. We will apply these data to understanding health
inequalities in incidence of and treatment for COVID-19 and long-COVID in the primary care setting.
Aim 1: Compare the incidence of COVID-19, long-COVID, and guideline concordant treatment for COVID-19
by race, ethnicity and area based social deprivation in the primary care setting.
Aim 2: Estimate the effect of geography and area based social deprivation on the incidence of COVID-19 and
long-COVID and guideline concordant treatment for COVID-19 in the primary care setting.
Aim 3: Evaluate differences in summary statistics for COVID-19 and long-COVID diagnoses contrasting
estimates generated using different data types.
While our Specific Aims are to demonstrate the utility of this data for health equity research specific to COVID-
19 and long-COVID, this proposal will enable the development of these underlying data for more general use
examining equity for drugs, procedures and device safety for a variety of health conditions."
10933515,"Numerous exploratory research studies over the past decade have demonstrated good to excellent agreement of remote neurocognitive assessment (rNCA) compared to paper-based Face-to-Face (p-FTF) by both televideo and telephonic modalities. Studies in samples of elderly subjects with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias reported similar results. Rationale for rNCA include addressing the needs of underserved populations, reducing risk of exposure to infective disorders such as COVID-19 and variants, rapid care access, and minimizing travel burden to clinical centers. Currently, televideo-based rNCA is implemented using conferencing devices and services with a “remote” examiner entering patient responses onto paper forms. Tests requiring graphical entry pose complications. Telephonically-based rNCA enables in-home assessment and longitudinal tracking and follow up but is similarly dependent on paper-based data capture and associated manual processing.
A purpose-designed Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) is proposed that will enable unified, end-to-end rNCA assessment and management based on an enterprise-level, next-generation hybrid REACT NATIVE (hRN) architecture. CARES will host computerized versions of reference standard neurocognitive and behavioral tests widely applied in the clinical identification and assessment of MCI and Alzheimer’s disease and for controlled trials and wide-ranging research. Televideo-based assessments will be performed by a remote “Virtual Examiner” approach, enabling administration as if seated adjacent to a patient or research participant. At the start of a session and between tests, a Remote Examiner (R-Ex) and a participant will be able to see and converse with each other in full screen mode, establishing and maintaining rapport. At a participant-hosting site, the system will be comprised of a Windows 10-11 PC and an ultrathin 15.6” touch-sensitive secondary monitor (e.g., ViewSonic TD1655) enabling graphical stylus entry for commonly applied tests such as Clock Drawing and Trail Making. CARES has been designed to accommodate the elderly and those with cognitive impairments by closely integrating the R-Ex who will be able to 1) control the mouse and keyboard on the site’s PC, entering responses, 2) control session pace, 3) repeat and supplement digitized (human voice) instructions, and 4) immediately score responses (e.g., verbal report), and 5) pause or terminate a test. These capabilities will be enabled by integrated, application-specific Remote Desktop Control (RDC) operability and screen sharing. Application-integrated web connectivity will be implemented by a proprietary peer-to-peer WebRTC communication layer. The multiplatform CARES will support assessment across televideo, telephonic, and (computerized) in-person modalities and across operating systems (Windows, iOS, Android). In Phase I, the system will be evaluated at two established Alzheimer’s centers to estimate concurrent validity, reliability, and acceptability of CARES computerized versions vs. p-FTF versions in a set of neurocognitive tests commonly applied in the evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. CARES represents a fundamental advance in operationalizing rNCA."
10766782,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal represents a highly innovative line of research focused on understanding the mechanism/s
by which PHF21B (plant homeodomain finger protein 21B) deficiency impairs social memory. Social
impairments, which may be present in multiple psychiatric disorders, are characterized by deficiencies in
social functioning. Social cognitive impairments are a central feature of several neurodegenerative,
neuropsychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. They also frequently occur following acute brain damage after traumatic brain injury
and stroke. We present conceptually novel evidence showing that PHF21B deficiency significantly impairs
social memory. In the three-chamber social interaction test, the social preference index of the PHF21B
deficient mice did not significantly differ, but they spent more time interacting with the new stranger than
with the familiar stranger compared to wild-type mice. Therefore, their social novelty index was
significantly greater than wild-type animals, suggesting social memory deficits. Social memory
impairments were further confirmed using the 5-trial social memory test. Our new data also support the
concept that PHF21B binds to the epigenetic marker tri-methylated Lys36 at histone H3 (H3K36me3), a
histone marker associated with expressed gene bodies and recruits proteins implicated in transcription,
splicing, and DNA repair. The proposed studies will interrogate the specific role(s) of PHF21B in neuronal
function relevant to social behaviors, specifically in social recognition impairment. Expected outcomes are
to characterize the role of PHF21B in the hippocampus and identify its target genes and regulatory
mechanisms relevant to social memory. We expect that the proposed studies will provide novel insights
into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic changes that affect social recognition
memory. The results to be generated by this project have translational potential as they may facilitate the
development of novel pharmacological targets for social memory deficits."

Of all gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer (OCa) has the highest mortality rate in the US. Patients with serous
OCa respond to current treatments, including cytotoxic therapy and surgery. But about 90% of patients have
recurrence, and they inevitably pass away from a disease that is chemoresistant. Leukemia inhibitory factor
(LIF), a cytokine that belongs to the interleukin-6 family, and it signals through the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and
LIFR complex. My preliminary research using tumor online data bases revealed that LIF is strongly expressed
in OCa compared to normal tissues, and expression levels of LIF and LIFR were significantly greater in
chemotherapy non-responders as compared to responders. Further, my analyses of conditioned medium and
cell lysates collected form 18 different OCa cells confirmed existence of autocrine loops of LIF and LIFR in
OCa. However, the mechanisms and therapeutic utility of targeting LIFR axis to treat chemotherapy resistance
remain unknown, representing a major knowledge gap and this premise will be tested in F99 phase. In F99
phase, I will test the hypothesis that disruption of LIF/LIFR signaling will sensitize resistant cells to
chemotherapy, and maintenance therapy with LIFR inhibitor will delay chemotherapy resistance.
Specifically, I will establish the significance and mechanisms of LIFR axis in promoting chemotherapy
resistance in serous OCa cells using CRISPR KO and global genomic approaches. I will test the utility of LIFR
inhibitor EC359 in treating/preventing development of chemotherapy resistance using patient derived
organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) models. The hypoxic circumstances that bigger tumors experience
decrease chemotherapy response and are exacerbated by ascites. Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)
are activated by cancer cells to stimulate vasculogenesis, control cell metabolism, and promote cell
growth as a defense mechanism against hypoxic stress. Moreover, hypoxia transactivates two functional
hypoxia responsive elements within LIF promoter and induces LIF expression. There is a relationship between
OCa Stem Cells (CSCs) and tumor chemoresistance and recurrence. Antiangiogenic treatment resistance and
chemoresistance of ovarian CSCs are both influenced by hypoxia. Together, these recent findings imply
that the hypoxic tumor microenvironment increases the expression of HIFs, LIF, and efflux transporters, as
well as development of chemoresistance in CSCs. In the K00 phase, I will expand my training into the area of
hypoxia mediated stemness, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and therapy resistance. Specifically, I
will define the mechanisms by which hypoxia and LIF/LIFR axis induce EMT and stemness and establish the
significance of hypoxia-LIF/LIFR axis in the development of OCa resistance to targeted therapy. The proposed
research in F99/K00 is clinically important because it will define the significance of LIFR axis in OCa
progression, chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy resistance and establish LIFR as a novel therapeutic
target for the treatment of OCa."
10843248,"Cancer cells despite defective DNA damage response (DDR) have unique ability to repair their DNA and continue
their DNA replication. The higher rate of DNA replication and heightened DNA repair activity (albeit error-prone)
though ensure uncontrolled proliferation but also produce genetic mutations at high frequencies in cancer cells.
This alteration of cellular DNA and dependency of cancer cells to incessant replication initially became the
justification for targeting DNA as a cancer therapy. Though successful to some extent, the major limitations of
DNA targeting drugs that are used in clinics today include life threatening toxicity, acquired resistance and
occurrence of secondary cancers. These problems mostly stem from the ability of DNA targeting drugs to
indiscriminately bind to cellular DNA or other non-DNA macromolecules resulting in DNA damage. We reason
new DNA interacting drugs that (1) display high sequence/region specificity (2) do not directly damage the DNA
and (3) target DNA-related processes that tumor cells use but not the normal cells could have favorable
therapeutic outcomes. In this proposal, we provide compelling evidence that Carbazole Blue (CB) may be one
such drug that we recently developed. We synthesized CB from carbazole, which is an active ingredient of coal
tar that is used for the treatment of Psoriasis. Using an unbiased genome-wide approach, we discovered that CB
interacts with A/T rich DNA regions. Importantly, using cell lines, patient-derived ex-vivo explants (PDEx),
patient-derived organoids (PDO) and xenografts (PDX) as well as orthotopic xenograft models, we found that in
contrast to chemotherapy drugs, CB is a potent and safe anti-cancer compound as systemic delivery of CB
inhibits growth and progression of TNBC and ER+ breast cancers (BCs) without inducing any toxicity. We
discovered that CB inhibits the activity of A/T rich binding protein HMGA1 and consequently expression of several
genes including CDK4, MCMs, GINS and CDC6 and that are highly expressed in these BCs and play critical
roles in replication and DNA repair. Importantly, HMGA1 and its target proteins are reported to regulate PARP
inhibitor (PARPi) and CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) responses in TNBC and metastatic ER+BCs, respectively.
Three Specific Aims are proposed: In Aim1, we will test the hypothesis that CB preferentially targets specific
domains in the DNA that are critical for cancer cell proliferation/progression to selectively induce cancer cell
death. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which CB utilizes target genes such as HMGA1 to sensitize
PARPi and CDK4/6i responses leading to growth/metastasis inhibition of TNBC and ER+BCs, respectively. In
Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CB serves as a novel, safe and potent anti-tumor agent and therapeutic
adjuvant for treating BCs using PDX, PDO and PDEx models. We will also establish PK/PD parameters required
for future clinical development of CB. Successful completion of this study will set the stage for a new paradigm
of treating BCs using CB as a therapeutic."
10898827,"Project Summary
Following weight loss, the new lower body weight is extremely difficult to maintain. Many studies have now shown
this is because individuals who lose a significant amount of body weight typically have an “Energy Expenditure
Gap” (EEgap) post-weight loss, defined operationally as total energy expenditure (TEE) in the pre-obese state,
minus TEE in the post-weight loss state, when at the same body weight. Recent studies suggest that the EEgap
may be caused in part by compensatory and enduring reductions in basal energy expenditure (BEE) resulting
from increases in activity-induced energy expenditure (AEE). Therefore, someone who has lost significant weight
has to consume less and expend more energy to stay weight-stable compared to weight-matched individuals
who have never been overweight. Physical activity ranges from a subconscious drive to move (spontaneous
physical activity, SPA) to voluntary, structured, goal-oriented and high-intensity physical activity (programmed
exercise). Increasing EE through physical activity, in combination with caloric restriction is a common therapeutic
approach for weight loss, but most individuals do not adhere to physical exercise programs or maintain sufficient
intensity to compensate for reductions in TEE post weight-loss. Our lab is one of few to study CNS regulation of
SPA and have focused on the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin A (OXA), which plays a central role in promoting
wakefulness and energy homeostasis. We found that OXA injection and/or orexin neuron activation reverses
BEE reductions and increases NEAT and TEE in animal models, without compensatory increases in food intake.
Our collaborator Dr. Zhang is on the forefront of developing new small molecular orexin agonists that activate
both orexin 1(OX1R) and orexin 2 (OX2R) receptors, and one such OX agonist upon i.p. administration robustly
enhances SPA without changing food intake in middle aged mice and 5-mo old obesity prone (OP) rats. In
addition, chronic (5wk) administration of the agonist reduced adiposity and weight gain in the New Zealand
Obese (NZO) mice, supporting orexin agonists as a potential therapy to prevent weight relapse post weight-loss.
The goal of the current project is to test the effects of these orexin agonists in reducing the EEgap, following
weight-loss in rodent models of obesity, and to understand if the underlying mechanism involves alterations in
mitochondrial respiration. We will also test the effect of these agonists on sleep/wake patterns for side effects.
To do this, we will use indirect calorimetry in conjunction with behavioral analyses and peripheral administration
of orexin agonist(s), to determine if activation of the orexin system suppresses weight regain. The long-term goal
of this project is to enable research and development in using orexin as a therapy for obesity, weight regain and
associated comorbidities."

Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a substantially increased risk for cervical cancer when compared to women
without HIV infection (1). Georgia has the second largest population of people living with HIV in the US, with a
prevalence of 1.9 times the national rate (2). Simultaneously, Georgia’s rates of cervical cancer are notably
higher than the national average with 8.0 per 100,000 women diagnosed between 2015-2019 (3). Black women
are disproportionately impacted by HIV(4) and cervical cancer in Georgia (5) and have significantly higher rates
of being lost to follow-up and not undergoing colposcopy or treatment after an abnormal cervical cancer screen
when compared to white women (6). It is thus imperative that Georgia is a focal point of pragmatic clinical trials
to address cervical cancer screening and treatment among WLWH who face health disparities. The Georgia
Consortium to Eliminate Cervical Cancer in Women Living with HIV (GaCECC) encompasses established, well-
funded programs in Georgia that service WLWH and are primed to conduct the ‘CASCADE’ Network clinical
trials. The GaCECC includes Emory University HIV research and clinical networks, urban and rural Ryan White
funded clinics, Morehouse School of Medicine’s (MSM’s) extensive community networks, Georgia Cancer Center
for Excellence at Grady Health System (GCCE), and respected HIV and women’s health community-based
organizations in Georgia. The GaCECC has access to thousands of WLWH through various clinical sites that
served over 9,000 WLWH and performed over 5,000 cervical cancer screenings between 2020-2021 in both
urban and rural settings across Georgia. These sites serve high proportions of Black women who are
disproportionately affected by social determinants of health. The GaCECC’s experienced client navigation
services will work to optimize participant access to and completion of recommended screening and treatment
sequences. The GaCECC recruitment and retention team will assure seamless linkage of care between positive
screens at community clinics and colposcopy at the GCCE. Grady Memorial Hospital will provide its Grady Mobile
Health Center Vehicle to bring colposcopy to women who are unable to travel to the GCCE. Emory University,
MSM, and AAPHC partner gynecologists will deliver ‘CASCADE’ Network protocol-based treatment at the
GCCE, Ponce Infectious Disease Clinic, and rural gynecology offices associated with AAPHC. Experienced
investigators and research staff in HIV and HPV clinical trials will proficiently implement clinical trials protocols
and ensure optimal retention. The GaCECC will use the strengths and resources leveraged by each collaborator
in this consortium to address cervical cancer prevention for WLWH. In sum, the GaCECC will harness its clinical
and research leadership in HIV care and cervical cancer prevention (Aim 1) to advance research in cervical
cancer prevention among WLWH through the ‘CASCADE’ Network clinical trial, (Aim 2) to implement pragmatic
clinical trials in cervical cancer prevention across all four scientific focus areas (Aim 3) and to utilize its network
of community partnerships to enroll and retain WLWH with an emphasis on equity and diversity."
10898915,"Rates of perinatal HIV transmission have fallen substantially due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy
during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, this has led to a growing population of infants who are HIV-
exposed but uninfected (iHEU). iHEU display heightened inflammation, immune activation and immune
exhaustion potentially driven by their altered gut microbiota. HIV exposure has also been linked to impaired
growth (stunting) in infants. Multiple studies have shown evidence of stunting in iHEU compared to HIV
unexposed infants (iHU). In addition, malnutrition studies have linked chronic intestinal inflammation, which also
associated with gut microbiota alteration, in infants to impaired growth. The mechanism(s) behind impaired
growth in iHEU are not understood. It is plausible that heightened intestinal inflammation in iHEU may associate
with stunting. However, whether the gut microbiota in iHEU causes impaired growth has not been formally tested.
Beyond growth, the gut microbiota impacts immune development. Specifically, microbiota composition early in
life imprint lasting immunological consequences. iHEU display high infectious morbidity including to enteric
pathogens. For example, studies have shown that iHEU exhibit high prevalence of enteropathogenic Escherichia
coli (EPEC) and Cryptosporidium spp compared to unexposed counterparts. The gut microbiota has been shown
to protect against enteric pathogens via various mechanisms including colonization resistance and alteration of
mucosal immunity. Whether gut microbiota in iHEU enhance susceptibility to enteric pathogens is unknown.
Human studies are based on correlations which limit ability to infer causation. We will utilize a germ-free neonatal
mouse model to investigate the causal role of the early stool microbiota in iHEU in driving these clinical
phenotypes. In addition, we will use a neonatal mouse model of EPEC to test causality between stool microbiota
and immunity to enteric pathogens. We hypothesize that the gut microbiota of iHEU early in life causes
inflammation, poor growth and impairs immunity to enteric pathogens. We propose to test this hypothesis
with the following specific aims.
Aim 1: To investigate whether the early life gut microbiota of iHEU causes intestinal and systemic inflammation

Aim 2: To investigate whether the early life gut microbiota of iHEU impairs immunity to enteric pathogens"
10932228,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is currently incurable with significant
unmet medical needs. In the US, over a million people suffer from this disease with an estimated cost of $27
billion per year. The mainstay of PD management is symptomatic treatment with drugs that increase dopamine
in the striatum. However, the utility of these drugs is significantly curtailed by waning efficacy and debilitating
side effects. Since PD stems from the degeneration of a single cell type, dopaminergic (DA) neurons that
supply dopamine to a defined location the striatum, PD patients have been viewed as optimal candidate for cell
transplantation therapy. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that transplantation of primary fetal
midbrain DA neurons into the striatum, provide significant and sustained restoration of function. However
ethical, practical and safety issues with using fetal aborted tissue and the recent progress in induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), grafting trials in PD are beginning to re-emerge world-wide with a new focus on
pluripotent stem cell technologies. However, clinical studies to date suggest that critical refinements in the
cellular product, in the delivery method, and in the clinical protocol by considering the incorporation of
adjunctive therapies, are essential to realize the potential of cell therapy in PD. NeoNeuron LLC has developed
intellectual property on scalable and effective technologies for generating an unlimited supply of DA neurons
from iPSCs and an image-guided methodology for delivering the cells into the target area of the brain enabling
functional recovery in the rat and in the nonhuman primate models of PD. In preparation for our Investigational
New Drug (IND) submission, NeoNeuron met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and received
recommendations to conduct optimal dose range for the cellular product, iPSC-DA neurons, in the
immunocompromised rat model of PD. The company has established standard operating procedures to
expand this product under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP), and to produce DA neurons that will
be available as an off-the-shelf product. This feature is desirable for the development of the intended product
for clinical use and for commercialization. In Aim 1 we will show evidence of dose-response and adequate
levels of DA cell engraftment and survival for a 6-month duration in the hemi- parkinsonian rat model of PD.
Aim 2 will assess the impact of adjunctive physical and cognitive training on motor and cognitive functions in
the grafted animals. We will leverage single cell spatial transcriptomics profiling of the grafted cells to gain

10758222,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
 Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the 5th leading cause of cancer in the United States. Among them, diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) represent the two most common forms, together
accounting for over 60% of diagnoses. Despite remarkable advances in the treatment of these diseases,
mortality remains high in as many as 40% of DLBCL patients, and FL, although regarded as an indolent disease,
is incurable in advanced stages, often transforming into a highly aggressive malignancy. Relapse and
transformation are linked to common mutated progenitor cells that maintain a subset of “founder” mutations
present in the diagnostic dominant tumor clone. Therefore, improved understanding of the biology of the common
precursor and the identification of mechanisms that could be vulnerable to targeted therapeutic intervention are
therefore a priority in order to advance our ability to cure these diseases.
 Somatic mutations that inactivate the CREBBP acetyltransferase, including truncating and HAT domain
missense mutations, emerged as the second most common genetic alteration in FL (70% of cases) and DLBCL
(40% of cases belonging to the recently identified EZB/C3 genetic subset), revealing a prominent role for
epigenetic aberrations in the pathogenesis of GC-derived lymphomas (Pasqualucci et al., Nature 2011; Morin et
al., Nature 2011). CREBBP mutations represent early events during the tumor phylogenetic evolution, which are
acquired by the common mutated precursor prior to the acquisition of additional oncogenic lesions (Pasqualucci
et al, Cell Reports 2014; Okosun et al., Nature Genetics 2014). Indeed, reduced dosage of CREBBP synergizes
with BCL2 deregulation to enhance the development of human-like FL/DLBCL. While truncating mutations have
been extensively studied, the role of missense mutations remains largely unexplored. This is a significant gap
when considering that missense mutations account for the overwhelming majority of CREBBP alterations in FL,
and that different from truncating mutations, these alleles are expressed, suggesting that they could interfere
with compensatory mechanisms by other acetyltransferases or the recruitment of transcription complexes. In
line with this hypothesis, preliminary data from us and others have shown that the hotspot CREBBP missense
HAT mutation induces distinct changes compared to those observed in CREBBP-deficient cells.
 Building on these results, the general goal of this project is to elucidate the impact of CREBBP missense
(vs truncating) mutations on the malignant transformation of the precursor GC B cell in vivo, with three Specific
Aims: i) investigate the in vivo role of the most common R1446H mutational hostspot in GC responses and
lymphomagenesis; ii) identify the shared vs unique transcriptional programs dysregulated by missense vs
truncating mutations in the GC B cell precursor; iii) investigate the role of CREBBP mutations in reprogramming
the GC microenvironment. We anticipate that the results obtained from these studies will provide new insights
on the mechanisms initiating neoplastic transformation and on their specific therapeutic targeting."

Chronic HIV infection remains a public health challenge with nearly 38 million people worldwide living with
HIV/AIDS. Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in suppressing ongoing viral replication, numerous
challenges remain including chronic inflammation and accelerated onset of comorbidities. Better understanding
of the mechanisms contributing to these phenomena is imperative to further reduce comorbidities and improve
treatment of HIV. The microbiome is comprised of trillions of diverse microbes (bacterial, fungal, viral), and
multiple lines of evidence highlight the connections between the microbiome, mucosal immune system, and
HIV-related inflammation. While the intestinal microbiome has been the focus of intense research, less is
known about the role of the oral microbiome in health and disease. In non-HIV settings, the oral microbiome
has been associated with increased risk of inflammation-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.
Recent evidence has also highlighted the connection between the oral and gut microbiomes, and increased
colonization of aerotolerant “oral” bacteria in the gut has been observed in many inflammatory diseases,
including HIV. Studies examining the oral microbiome in the setting of HIV are limited, and none have
examined the relationships between oral to gut bacteria translocation, onset of dysbiosis, and systemic
inflammation in HIV. We hypothesize that bacterial translocation from the mouth to the gut contributes to the
development of dysbiosis in chronic HIV infection. Further, we hypothesize that the oral microbiome
contributes to local and systemic inflammation in chronic HIV, and this altered mucosal environment may
increase susceptibility for oral infections. Using longitudinal specimens, novel saliva analyses, and
epidemiologic clinical outcomes we will systematically address our hypotheses. We propose to: 1) determine
the contribution of oral microbiota to gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation in persons living with HIV; 2)
define the relationship between salivary IgA responses to key oral bacteria and local and systemic
inflammation; and 3) identify specific oral bacteria that may predict risk of oral sexually transmitted infections
(STI) in at-risk persons with and without HIV. This work will help better define the complex relationships
between the oral microbiome, inflammation, and infection susceptibility in HIV; a critical step for developing
novel strategies and saliva-based monitoring tools to better treat HIV and reduce comorbidities."

Title: Targeting IKKepsilon-mediated nucleotide synthesis in KSHV-associated lymphoma
Human gamma herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are causative agents of diverse malignancies in immune-
compromised individual, including AIDS patients and organ transplant recipients. In addition to
KS, KSHV is invariably associated with two types of lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma
(PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). No vaccine or effective treatment is
available for KSHV-associated malignancies, though antiviral therapy targeting viral thymidine
kinase is an option with limited efficacy.
We have an outstanding interest in virus-host interaction involving innate immune defense
system. Recently, we discovered that KSHV exploits the IKKepsilon kinase to reprogram
metabolism in KSHV latently-infected PEL cells. Specifically, KSHV activates IKKepsilon to fuel
de novo nucleotide synthesis via activating key metabolic enzymes known as glutamine
amidotransferases. In doing so, IKKepsilon promotes the proliferation of KSHV-infected PEL
cells and depletion of IKKepsilon arrests these cells at G0/G1 phase. This study will delineate
the molecular interaction that KSHV activates IKKepsilon in metabolic reprogramming to support
immortal proliferation of PEL cells. We have developed novel small-molecule inhibitors of
IKKepsilon and glutamine amidotransferases. We will explore these drug-like molecules to
target IKKepsilon and glutamine amidotransferase to impede PEL cell proliferation. Our work
will not only elucidate fundamental mechanism governing PEL cell metabolism and proliferation,
but also provide proof-of-concept that targets host factors to treat KSHV-associated
malignancies."

The number of older people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) has increased dramatically in the past
decade in the US and other Western countries. PLWH experience similar health problems as the
general population of older individuals, but at an increased frequency and severity, which is
consistent with accentuated aging. Extensive evidence, including studies in the PI’s laboratory,
demonstrated amyloid pathology in HIV-1 infection, including dysregulations at the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) interface. HIV-infected brains have advanced amyloidopathy, which is characterized
by increased amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition mostly in the perivascular space when compared to
age-matched controls. Among HIV-associated non-AIDS comorbidities, cerebrovascular
diseases, including ischemic stroke, are particularly frequent. While the mechanisms of these
conditions are not fully understood, the present application focuses on the role of enhanced
procoagulant environment and amyloidopathy as critically important underlying factors.
Our current proposal is built on the most exciting and clinically relevant findings resulting from the
previous funding cycle, which explored the role of extracellular vesicles (EV) in Aβ transfer to
neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and their impaired neurogenesis. We mapped EV cargo proteins
and identified Serpine-1 (also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, PAI-1), in various
crossroads of neurodegenerative pathways relevant to HIV-associated neurocognitive decline
(HAND). This is a paramount discovery because Serpine-1 plays a role in both the generation of
a procoagulant environment, and the production and accumulation of Aβ. Therefore, we
hypothesize that a procoagulant environment driven by elevated Serpine-1 levels
contributes to increased risk of ischemic events, delayed post-ischemic recovery, and
enhanced amyloidopathy in HIV-infected brain. Specific mechanisms evaluated in this
application include dysregulation of the BBB and enhanced amyloidopathy (Aim 1), reprograming
mitochondria and induction of inflammatory responses (Aim 2), and impaired differentiation and
migration of NPCs (Aim 3).
The complex role of Serpine-1 in HIV-1 infection in the context of both ischemic events and
amyloidopathy has been overlooked in the literature, making our proposal conceptually novel.
Moreover, this research has potential to generate new therapeutic targets and strategies in aging
and HIV-1 infection, especially in prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular comorbidities,
including ischemic events."
11063903,"Memory CD4+ T cells are believed to be the primary reservoir for HIV; however, emerging evidence suggests
an important role for naïve CD4+ T cells. Specifically, sequencing studies suggest the naïve reservoir
contributes substantially to the intact HIV reservoir in chronic progressors, but is practically absent in elite
controllers. While the naïve reservoir is small, it may have outsized effects on the overall reservoir since we
find the naïve reservoir repopulates the memory based on preliminary clone tracking studies. Objective: The
long-term goal is to dissect the role of the naïve reservoir on the overall reservoir in acutely infected individuals
and in a primary model of latency. We will first determine the extent and frequency of naïve infection in acutely
treated individuals. The naïve reservoir has been understudied in this population, but as early ART initiation
becomes more frequent, it is essential to understand the consequences on the overall reservoir. We
hypothesize that the naïve reservoir may be a good predictor of overall reservoir decay. Premise: Underlying
this hypothesis is the idea that the naïve reservoir has a unique ability to provide a long-lived relatively safe
harbor for proviruses due to their relative resistance to immune clearance, while the memory reservoir is more
prone to express HIV and to experience CD8 clearance. Aims: We will determine the contribution of infected
naïve T cells to reservoir dynamics in acutely treated individuals (Aim1) and present a novel ex vivo model to
test the underlying hypothesis behind the mechanism of naïve's contribution (Aim2). Design and Methods: In
both aims, we will measure reservoir size, diversity, clonality, proviral orientation and their dynamics over time
using proviral sequencing and a novel integration site sequencing. To avoid limiting dilution, we developed
methods utilizing Primer-ID to link barcoded proviral sequences to their integration sites. Our optimized model
with barcode tracking uniquely enables us to follow the fate of individual infected naïve T cells. This approach
reveals distinct properties of the naïve reservoir related to its reactivation potential as well as its response to
cognate antigen, LRAs and CD8s. A critical innovation of our model is the ability to track specific subsets under
various conditions that perturb the reservoir. In Aim3, we use the data generated from restricted infections
(Aim2) to dissect the role of naïve and memory infection using mathematical models and then compare the
effect of the naïve reservoir on HIV dynamics in acutely treated individuals from Aim1. We envision this work
will show that naïve infection is fundamental to a formidable reservoir and will ultimately provide a useful
preclinical model for evaluating mechanisms of persistence and future therapies. We will evaluate the effect of
various LRAs and CD8s on the naïve versus memory reservoir to provide a more thorough mechanistic
understanding of the naïve reservoir. These experiments will provide insights into the failure of latency reversal
and ultimately shed light on new approaches for targeting this reservoir in disguise."
10763887,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteoarthritis is a highly debilitating disease affecting more than a quarter million people worldwide. Its
etiology is multifactorial, with age, gender, obesity, joint injury and heredity among the contributing factors.
Articular cartilage is intrinsically unable to heal itself. Any damage results in its progressive loss, inflammation
and pain. OA is a disease of the entire joint, and its pathology includes the progressive loss of cartilage,
subchondral bone thickening, osteophyte formation, synovial inflammation, degeneration of ligaments and
knee menisci, and hypertrophy of the joint capsule. Molecular mechanisms regulating OA are poorly
understood. No effective disease-modifying treatments are currently available for OA, leaving pain
management or surgical joint replacement as the only therapeutic options. Our preliminary studies identify
Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) as a potential therapeutic target against OA. Articular
chondrocytes express CaMKK2 and its levels are higher in OA. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition
of CaMKK2 protects against cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone alterations in
a murine model of surgically induced OA. When challenged with interleukin-1β, articular chondrocytes from
Camkk2-/- mice display attenuated catabolic and inflammatory responses, in part through downregulation of the
adenosine mono-phosphate dependent protein kinase and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase signaling
pathways. Based on these data, we hypothesize that CaMKK2 coordinates chondrocyte-responses to injury
and inflammatory cytokines, and its function in chondrocytes plays a crucial role in the development of OA.
Aim 1 will investigate whether the protection from OA as observed in the global knockout mice comes from the
cell-intrinsic role of CaMKK2 in chondrocytes. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms by which CaMKK2
regulates catabolic and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes. Further, absence or inhibition of CaMKK2
suppresses macrophages and osteoclasts. Conditional deletion of CaMKK2 from these cells, as proposed in
Aim 3, will provide insights on how CaMKK2 function in synovial macrophages and subchondral bone
contribute to OA, and/or influence chondrocyte responses to inflammatory cytokines. Information generated
from the proposed studies will provide a basis for developing CaMKK2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic
approach to treat OA."
10763888,"Normal tissue development and tumor metastasis require extensive cell movements, and border cell
migration in the Drosophila ovary provides a powerful in vivo model. Border cells migrate as a group of two
different cell types, a pair of non-migratory polar cells in the center that recruit 6-8 epithelial cells to surround
and carry them between nurse cells to the developing oocyte, in a structure called an egg chamber. Using
this system, we first discovered the in vivo role of the 21kD GTPase Rac in protrusion and migration, then
showed that photoactivation of Rac in one cell could steer the entire cluster. For more than two decades
though, we were puzzled that expression of constitutively active Rac in border cells seemed to destroy the
entire egg chamber. During the current funding period, we solved this longstanding mystery. We discovered
that border cells expressing active Rac kill the nurse cells. Anterior follicle cells normally engulf and kill nurse
cells late in oogenesis, and we propose that active Rac prematurely activates this program. A similar
mechanism may explain otherwise mysterious immune deficiencies in human patients. Here we propose to
continue our exciting investigation of the spatiotemporal control of Rac-mediated cell migration and
engulfment in Drosophila. In Aim 1 we propose to elucidate the mechanisms of Rac-mediated cell killing.
Taking advantage of the border cell model, we will test the functional effects of each of the known activating
Rac mutations that cause immunodeficiencies in patients. We will test the hypothesis that border cells
expressing active Rac prematurely activate the normal developmental killing program, and we will define
more precisely the role of Rac within the molecular pathway. We will investigate how just six cells can
destroy an entire egg chamber, and we will identify the chemical, physical, and adhesive properties that
govern target cell selection. In Aim 2, we propose to follow up on our discovery that a basally localized Rac
activator is required for border cell cluster cohesion and migration. We will elucidate its relationship to
basolateral complex proteins and test whether its primary function is to localize Rac activity to basal
surfaces. We will test the hypothesis that basal Rac activity is required to generate basal protrusions that in
turn coordinate collective cell behavior. In Aim 3, we will follow up on a screen in which we have identified
Rho family activators and inhibitors required in border cells. We propose that border cells require elaborate
spatiotemporal control of Rac due to their needs to: maintain apicobasal polarity despite being detached
from basement membrane, extend and retract forward-directed protrusions, maintain cohesion under strain,
and inhibit inappropriate protrusion. Our ultimate goal is the decipher the Rac regulatory network."

One in fifty Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma in their lifetime and skin cutaneous melanoma is the
deadliest skin cancer. Cancer immunotherapy is a breakthrough approach to treat this disease and cytotoxic
CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration is a critical factor to immunotherapeutic success. As such, identifying effective
strategies to increase the magnitude and functionality of the patient’s tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell response
remains an important goal. Inhibitory molecules on CD8+ T cells are imperative to T-cell signaling and immune
homeostasis. However, elevated expression of these molecules is correlated with dampened antitumor effector
response as well as poorer patient survival. FcγRIIB is an inhibitory Fc receptor recently discovered on a subset
of CD8+ T cells. FcγRIIB+ CD8+ T cells exhibit increased expression of activation markers, higher proliferative
ability, and secrete more proinflammatory cytokines than their FcγRIIB- counterparts in mice and humans,
making them imperative to the antitumor response. Recently, we discovered that an immunosuppressive
cytokine, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2), is a ligand that binds FcγRIIB on CD8+ T cells and induces FcγRIIB-
mediated apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. The goal of this research is to interrogate the mechanism by which Fgl2
regulates tumor-specific FcγRIIB+ CD8+ T cells using syngeneic mouse models via the following aim. AIM 1
(F99): Determine the cellular and molecular mechanism by which Fgl2 critically regulates tumor-specific
CD8+ T cells. Our studies show that both Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and CD8+ T cells express Fgl2 at the tumors
of mice and humans. Thus, we will determine if Fgl2 secreted by these cell types is necessary and/or sufficient
for FcγRIIB-mediated CD8+ T-cell apoptosis, findings which would provide the impetus for subsequent
therapeutic targeting of this cell type. Additionally, as we have discovered that FcγRIIB-Fgl2 binding induces
apoptosis, the upstream requirements of apoptosis (e.g. T-cell receptor stimulation, proteins recruited to the
intracellular domain of FcγRIIB) are proximal items of investigation in the latter part of Aim 1. Piecing together
the pathway by which FcγRIIB induces apoptosis via Fgl2 could uncover a new CD8+ T cell pathway readily
harnessed for future immunotherapies. AIM 2 (K00): Identify novel mechanisms of T cell resistance to
cancer immunotherapy. After the F99 stage, I intend to transition to the K00 stage to begin postdoctoral studies.
Numerous studies highlight the role of elevated checkpoint molecule expression (PD-1, TIM-3) as well as
decreased proinflammatory cytokine production (IFNγ, TNF) in mediating resistance to ICB. The current
paradigm in cancer immunotherapy revolves around the suppressive impact of the tumor microenvironment on
T cells, but the existence and impact of immunosuppressive factors secreted by effector CD8+ T cells themselves
is incompletely understood. The impact of the proposed aims is considerable as they will identify novel targets,
that could rescue a population of memory CD8+ T cells that are crucial to the immune response to tumor."
11179104,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive, heterogeneous myeloid malignancy that results in bone marrow
failure. The Bcl-2 antagonist/BH3-mimetic, venetoclax (VEN), is used in combination with chemotherapy or
hypomethylating agents to treat newly diagnosed AML patients unable to tolerate induction chemotherapy.
However, relapse rates remain high due to de novo and acquired resistance attributed to mitochondrial
reprogramming and upregulation of compensatory survival proteins like Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Strategies that
antagonize mitochondrial respiration, induce the integrated stress response (ISR), and/or reduce Mcl-1/Bcl-xL
protein expression are known to improve VEN sensitivity. Importantly, sphingolipid (SL) metabolism,
mitochondrial respiration, the ISR, and Mcl-1 protein levels are closely linked, making SL metabolism an
attractive therapeutic target in combination with VEN. The balance of pro-apoptotic ceramides and pro-survival
sphingosine-1-phosphate form the bioactive core of sphingolipid signaling. Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lipid
hydrolase that catabolizes pro-apoptotic ceramides. We previously demonstrated that AML blasts rely on AC for
survival. Because we and others showed that AC inhibition severely impairs mitochondrial respiration, we sought
to determine whether combining AC inhibitors with VEN could be effective for treating AML. Our preliminary data
show that AC inhibition improves VEN sensitivity in human AML cell lines and patient samples. However, the
mechanisms underlying the synergy from this novel combination are unknown, and the in vivo efficacy of
combinatorial AC and Bcl-2 inhibition has not been explored. We hypothesize that synergy between AC and Bcl-
2 inhibition results from SL-mediated impairment of mitochondrial form, respiration, and ISR overactivation.
Aim 1 (F99 phase) is designed to complete my dissertation work by characterizing the mechanism, biomarkers,
and in vivo efficacy of combined AC and Bcl-2 inhibition in AML. To accomplish these goals, we will analyze
mitochondrial form and function, interrogate the role of the ISR for synergy, and utilize computational approaches
to define biomarkers of drug responses. My overarching career goal is to develop into a highly productive,
independent cancer researcher focused on developing novel SL-based therapeutics and precision medicine. To
best prepare myself to start an independent cancer research program, I will utilize the K00 period to i) learn new
skills in dynamic BH3 profiling (a precision medicine assay), CRISPR-Cas9 screening, and genomic data
analysis; and ii) expand my cancer research portfolio into solid tumors by studying triple-negative breast cancer.
Thus, Aim 2 (K00 phase) will evaluate the relationship between SLs and mitochondrial apoptotic priming using
dynamic BH3 profiling and will utilize CRISPR screening to identify novel SL-based combination therapies to
treat triple-negative breast cancer. The training plans in the F99/K00 phases will help me successfully achieve
my career goals and thrive as an independent cancer researcher."
10745301,"Project Summary/Abstract: Genome instability is the most significant feature associated with poor prognosis
in many cancers. But despite being a near-universal characteristic of human cancer, our knowledge of how
genome instability initiates and contributes to tumor development is lacking. Because of its wide presence and
close association with aggressive tumors, insight into the possible mechanisms and consequences of genome
instability is crucial in the search for new and targeted cancer therapies and diagnostics.
Here a new model is proposed, backed by significant preliminary findings, for the maintenance of genomic
stability by cis-acting long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) elements that regulate multiple aspects of large-scale
chromosome function. The main hypothesis of this project is that the recently discovered, cis-acting ASAR
lncRNAs (ASynchronously Replicating Autosomal RNA), are expressed by normal cells on all autosomes to
regulate fundamental chromosome behavior such as DNA replication timing, monoallelic gene expression, 3-
dimensional chromosome localization, and mitotic chromosome condensation, but are frequently disrupted in
cancer leading to genomic instability. Expression of the first two members of the ASAR family (ASAR6,
ASAR15) is required for stability on chromosome 6 and 15 respectively, and disruption of either lncRNA leads
to aberrant chromosomes through increased stalling of replication forks and mis-segregation of chromosomes.
The long-term objective of this research is to identify all ASARs on human autosomes, validate their functional
role in genome stability, and use ASARs as a tool to understand and ultimately identify and treat cancers with
genomic instability. In Aim 1 a genome wide search for expression of putative ASARs will be performed
utilizing a single-cell derived, haplotype-resolved human primary cell model system, followed by assessment of
the functional qualities of potential ASARS with nucleotide sequencing assays that measure DNA replication
timing, allele specific RNA expression, and 3D chromosome localization. To probe the potential effects of
ASARs on human health, a search for significant disruption of ASARs in a dataset of ~10,000 human tumor
samples will be performed.
The research will be conducted as part of a comprehensive training plan involving advanced skill development
in bioinformatics and biostatistics, professional development such as public speaking and networking, and will
take place within an extensive intellectual community composed of cancer biologists at the Knight Cancer
Institute, molecular and medical geneticists, and computational biologists at OHSU. The post-doctoral research
direction will translate the knowledge of chromosome biology and skillsets in genomics developed during the
pre-doctoral period to study the mechanisms of action of non protein-coding germline risk loci in human
cancer. The successful results of the proposed research will reveal basic functions of chromosomes and
provide new insight towards understanding genomic instability, a common abnormality in cancer."

The late stages of the mammalian pregnancy are accompanied with increased insulin resistance due to the
increased glucose demand of the growing fetus. Therefore, as a compensatory response, in order to maintain
the maternal normal blood glucose levels, the beta cells mass expands leading to increased insulin release.
Beta cell proliferation, beta cell neogenesis, and decreased beta cell apoptosis, are believed to be major
contributors for beta cell adaptive response during pregnancy and defects in this adaptive response can lead to
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). My preliminary results indicate that Nrf2 is required for adaptive beta cell
expansion in adult mice during overnutrition, and that Nrf2 levels are upregulated in beta cells of pregnant
mice. Despite multiple studies describing Nrf2 protective effects on beta cells in Type 2 and Type 1 diabetic
models, no study has ever uncovered the role of Nrf2 in the expansion of beta cell mass during pregnancy.
Does in vivo loss- or gain-of-Nrf2 function affect beta cell proliferation, survival and mass in pregnant mice?
Does this potential alteration persist in the early post-partum period? Does in vivo loss- or gain-of-Nrf2 function
affect insulin secretion in pregnant mice? Does in vivo loss- or gain-of-Nrf2 function affect glucose homeostasis
in pregnant mice? Which genes are upregulated and downregulated in islets during pregnancy in response to
in vivo loss or gain of Nrf2 function? Which are the Nrf2 target genes in islets during pregnancy? Do human
beta cells also require Nrf2 for pregnancy-driven proliferation? These important questions about the
physiological role of Nrf2 in beta cells during pregnancy need to be answered to advance our knowledge and
find therapeutic means to treat GDM. We hypothesize that Nrf2 is necessary for beta cell expansion during
pregnancy and that disruption of Nrf2 expression or function leads to GDM. We believe Nrf2 can serve as a
potential therapeutic target for treating GDM. We will test our hypothesis by completing the following specific
aims: 1) To determine the role of Nrf2 on the expansion of beta-cell mass during pregnancy. 2) To uncover the
mechanisms by which Nrf2 regulates beta-cell mass expansion during pregnancy. 3) To test if Nrf2 is
necessary for pregnancy-mediated adaptive human beta cell proliferation in vivo. These studies will provide
insight into how Nrf2 promotes expansion of functional beta-cell mass during pregnancy and will provide a
crucial basic platform for designing and testing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of GDM."

The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of
action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders.
One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-
effects of compounds. Another important issue is the lack of clear targets for CNS disorders, which are complex
and require polypharmacology. Phenotypic screening platforms are well-suited for drug discovery of compounds
in a target-agnostic manner, allowing for the discovery and development of poly pharmacological agents.
Suitable proven in vivo phenotypic screens, however, are rare with the exception of PsychoGenics SmartCube®
platform, which has been used to screened ~8000 compounds and reference drugs. Compound availability for
phenotypic screening, however, restrict discovery to known chemical spaces. Novel machine learning methods
are now available to design novel drugs that can be used to poke unexplored chemical spaces. The combination
of a machine learning model capturing structure-to-phenotype relationships and a model that can generate novel
drug-like compounds promises to deliver a truly novel platform. Our aims therefore are 1) to generate a structure-
to-phenotype machine learning model (“PhenCheML”) using our collection of more than 8000 compounds and
drugs screened in Psychogenics’ SmartCube® phenotypic in vivo platform, and 2) to combine such model with
Collaboration Pharma de novo drug design generative machine learning model MegaSyn®, and generate novel
CNS drug-like compounds for testing in vivo. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in PhenCheML,
a novel phenotypic machine learning-based drug discovery platform that can generate novel chemotypes and
predict their therapeutic value. If our Phase I project is successful, we will extend it in a Phase II application
through the design and synthesis of novel molecules for test in SmartCube® and validation in second tier assays
focusing on psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, psychosis, and bipolar disorder). We will also explore the
use of the platform for generation of novel compounds with potential therapeutic effects in model systems of
psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Rett, ASD, HD, PD, etc). If successful,
this platform will be an innovative and unique drug design method, offered by as fee-for-service or used in drug
development by PGI and its partners."
10885202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer ((gp120-gp41)3) binds to host
receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, and mediates the entry of the virus into the target cell. CD4 binding induces
large-scale conformational changes in the metastable Env trimer, resulting in transitions from a pretriggered,
“closed” conformation to more “open” conformations. The CD4-induced opening of the Env trimer allows the
gp120 subunit to bind the CCR5/CXCR4 coreceptor, which enables the fusion of viral and target cell membranes
by the gp41 transmembrane subunit.
CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) are small organic molecules that bind to a highly conserved pocket (the
Phe-43 cavity) on gp120, near the binding site for CD4. CD4mcs competitively block CD4 binding and
prematurely trigger conformational changes in Env similar to those induced by CD4. In the absence of a
coreceptor-expressing target cell, these prematurely activated Envs rapidly and irreversibly become non-
functional. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, CD4mcs open Env to the binding of antibodies that consequently
acquire neutralizing or cytotoxic potential. CD4mcs can synergize with antibodies to decrease the HIV-1-infected
cell reservoir in humanized mice and to protect monkeys from a heterologous SHIV mucosal challenge.
The CD4mc scaffold, which occupies the gp120 “vestibule” leading into the Phe-43 cavity, is a critical determinant
of the antiviral potential of these compounds. Replacing the tetramethyl-piperidine scaffold of the prototypic
CD4mcs with an indane scaffold opened the door to rationally designed improvements in antiviral potency and
breadth. Nonetheless, some primary HIV-1 strains with apparently accessible Phe-43 cavities remain relatively
resistant to current lead indane CD4mcs. We have recently identified novel CD4mc analogues with indoline
scaffolds that demonstrate impressive increases in antiviral potency and breadth. In this proposal, we capitalize
on this discovery to design further improvements in the indoline CD4mcs, to investigate the mechanisms
underlying their antiviral potency, and to determine how natural HIV-1 Env variation influences virus resistance
to CD4mcs and viral replication fitness. In the course of these studies, we will test the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Increasing the contacts of the indoline CD4mcs with conserved gp120 elements in the vestibule
will further enhance their antiviral potency and breadth; Hypothesis 2: Although CD4mc resistance in a small
subset of HIV-1 strains results from variation within the Phe-43 cavity, the sensitivity of most primary HIV-1
strains to CD4mcs is governed by differences in Env triggerability (the propensity of the Env to undergo
conformational change); and Hypothesis 3: CD4mcs gain potency by enhanced binding to the Env trimer,
leading to sequential activation and inactivation that ultimately result in gp120 shedding.
The knowledge generated by testing these hypotheses will assist efforts to improve the antiviral efficacy of
CD4mcs and will enhance their utility as small-molecule probes of HIV-1 Env conformation."

Multimorbidity, the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same individual, is an emergent global
threat to individual and public health as populations age. While the average life expectancy for a person with
HIV has reached 77 years, comorbidity-free years are ~16 fewer than the general population. Not only are
aging-related, chronic comorbidities more common in HIV, but onset is up to a decade earlier and women are
disproportionately affected. Despite the impact of multimorbidity—reduced quality of life, higher healthcare
utilization and cost, and premature mortality—being magnified among persons with HIV, current HIV Primary
Care Guidance does not specifically address multimorbidity, and screening and prevention tools are lacking. In
the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), an aging cohort of >12,000 persons with or at-risk of
HIV with >35 years of follow-up, we showed that aging-related comorbidity burden was significantly higher in
women than in men, particularly in persons with HIV. We also found that multimorbidity risk in treated persons
with HIV was mediated by both traditional and HIV-related factors. This patient-oriented career development
application builds on our prior work, and will use a geroscience-guided approach for optimizing care delivery
and outcomes for aging women and men with HIV at risk of premature multimorbidity across the lifespan. The
overarching conceptual framework prioritizes the study of the aging process as it affects multiple (as opposed
to singular) comorbidities and how these comorbid conditions cluster and have shared risk factors, causal
mechanisms, and/or impacts. The proposed Aims include: 1) To ascertain the age-specific evolution of
multimorbidity cascades; 2) To identify multimorbidity clusters and shared risk factors; and 3) To determine if
microvascular indicators predict the progression of multimorbidity status. My long-term career goal is to
become an independently-funded clinician-scientist whose work is focused on: 1) ascertaining multimorbidity
risk and impact across the lifespan of persons with HIV, and 2) translating these findings into sex-tailored
clinical and public health interventions that promote healthy aging. During this Award, I will be mentored by Dr.
Igho Ofotokun, a translational researcher in HIV end-organ damage; Dr. Anandi Sheth, an HIV implementation
scientist with expertise in women’s health; Dr. Solveig Cunningham, a chronic disease epidemiologist; Dr. Leah
Rubin, a neuroscientist focused on cognitive health patterns and predictors; and Dr. Camille Vaughan, a
geriatrician-clinical trialist with interventions expertise. Completion of the outlined research Aims and the
proposed training in geroscience research methods, advanced epidemiology and biostatistics including latent
class analysis and other cluster analytic techniques, and sex/gender health will significantly enhance my ability
to achieve my career goals to become an independent researcher in HIV comorbidity science and women’s
health. Emory University offers an ideal collaborative environment and provides robust research infrastructure
to complete the proposed career development plans and mentored research project outlined in this application."
10762847,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a critical problem that contributes to the spread of HIV and may intrinsically
worsen neuroHIV pathology. Although the prevalence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the lifespan
and quality of life of persons infected with HIV (PWH), the viral protein HIV-Tat is still present in the central
nervous system (CNS) of many PWH on ART. Further, almost half of PWH still experience cognitive deficits
and worsened substance misuse outcomes. Opioids can interact with HIV and HIV-Tat to promote
inflammation and exacerbate neuronal damage and dysfunction, leading to increased behavioral and cognitive
deficits, via µ-opioid receptors (MOR) expressed on different cell types. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within
the striatum are uniquely vulnerable to the combined effects of opioids and HIV/Tat, and associated with opioid
and HIV/Tat deficits in motivation and reward. The spiraling inflammation between astro- and microglia is
driven by astroglial CCL5-CCL2 inflammatory signaling and is critical to opioid exacerbation of HIV
neuropathology. However, the role of MOR on each cell sub-type are unknown. We hypothesize that the
neuroinflammatory response to combined opioid and HIV/Tat, resulting in increased neuronal damage and
aberrant behavior is largely mediated by MOR activation on astroglia. Aim 1 during the K99 phase will
characterize the impact of astroglial MOR on opioid and HIV-Tat-induced astroglial pathology and dysfunction
in vitro. MOR astroglial-null astroglia will be used to assess neuroinflammation and glutamate buffering, and
MSN survival and morphology. and assessed for opioid reward and in vivo astroglial calcium transients while
freely behaving and awake. Aim 2 (K99) will delineate the loss of MOR activation on astroglia on opioid and
HIV-Tat-induced astroglial pathology and dysfunction in vivo. Tat-tg mice will be crossed with MOR astroglial-
null mice and assessed for reward and in vivo astroglial calcium transients while freely behaving and awake.
Dysfunction will be correlated with neuroinflammation and neuropathology. The above mentored training in
genetically encoded indicators and in vivo calcium imaging combined with advance career development
training will prepare Dr. Nass for the independent R00 phase and be essential in her pursuit of an independent
research program investigating the mechanisms of substance misuse and neurovirology-induced behavioral
dysfunction. Aim 3 (R00) will determine if astroglial activation is required for opioid and HIV-Tat-induced
astroglial destabilization and MSN neuropathology. Tat-tg mice with attenuated astroglial function will be
assessed as described in Aims 1 and 2. The proposed studies will further our understanding of the
mechanisms by which MOR signaling on specific cell sub-type mediates opioid exacerbation of HIV/Tat-
induced inflammation and neuropathology within the reward circuitry and identify possible targets for
therapeutic interventions."
10763889,"Photoreceptors, the neurons that initiate vision, must adapt to survive in a hostile
cellular environment. In the retina they are exposed to damaging light radiation,
experience 100-fold fluctuations in intracellular Ca2+, are located near blood
vessels with high levels of O2, and use ATP faster than most other types of cells
in the body. To ensure optimal function and survival, photoreceptors must have a
robust system for maintaining healthy mitochondria. This would involve a regulated
balance between mitochondrial clearance, biogenesis, fusion and fission. Here
we propose a comprehensive analysis of the circadian regulation of these
processes and how they relate to changes in mitochondrial structure and metabolic
function. We exploit advantages of both the mouse and the zebrafish models and
our expertise studying metabolism and photoreceptor biology. In Aim 1 we will
define daily and circadian changes in photoreceptor mitochondria function and
structure. In Aim 2 we evaluate mitochondrial clearance and biogenesis and in
Aim 3 we examine cellular triggers underlying mitochondrial mobility. In summary,
we are asking several questions that are all directed toward understanding
mitochondria homeostasis. We will examine mitochondrial biogenesis, clearance,
morphology, number, factors influencing motility and metabolism at different times
of day both in light and dark. This will provide a broad and impactful overview of
how these processes are coordinated to optimize photoreceptor health and
function."
10763815,"Like transcription factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short regulatory non-coding RNAs known for their
role in organ development, cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and function, have been extensively studied
for their roles in controlling expression of different sets of genes that dictates the outcome of developmental
transitions or cellular activation status of the immune cell populations. Previously, we have identified an
important miRNA family, miR-23~27~24 clusters that play a diverse role in regulating the differentiation and
function of multiple CD4+ helper T (Th) cell lineages as well as regulatory T (Treg) cells. Our work has shown
that proper gene regulation by the miR-23~27~24 in CD4+ T cells is crucial to ensure the optimal balance
between immunity and tolerance. Loss of miR-23~27~24 clusters in T cells resulted in dysregulated follicular
helper (Tfh) cell responses when mice aged and severe Th2-driven airway inflammation upon challenges of
different allergens. On the other hand, excessive expression of members of this miRNA family would also
lead to the development of autoimmunity through both promoting the proinflammatory cytokine production by
effector T (Teff) cells as well as impairing Treg cell homeostasis and function. Considering that many of the
miRNA family targets identified in our previous work are also known to function in other immune cell
populations, miR-23~27~24 clusters likely have a broader impact on the immune system beyond their role in
regulating CD4+ T cell immunity. Here, we propose a multifaceted study employing genetic, biochemical,
immunological approaches and whole animal experimentation to comprehensively examine the molecular
and cellular mechanisms underlying miR-23 cluster-mediated immune regulation. In particular, while we will
expand our efforts in studying this miRNA family in T cell immunity with a new focus on CD8+ T cell-mediated
immune responses, we will also examine their potential new roles in both Tfh cells and B cells that are crucial
for establishment of germinal center (GC) reactions and the resultant humoral immunity. Next, by combining
RNA-seq, ChIP-seq approaches with newly developed IR-CLASH technology, we will explore the putative
molecular mechanisms underlying miR-23 cluster-dependent immune regulation through identification of
genes that are regulated in miR-23 cluster-dependent manner and through identification of targets that are
directly controlled by miR-23 cluster. Collective, the over-arching goal of the current proposal is to not only
establish a powerful model to dissect the molecular orchestration of cellular differentiation, function, and
homeostasis in the adaptive immune system but also build a solid foundation with which to target the
miR-23~27~24 family to combat infections and a wide array of human immunological diseases."
10763890,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Contact network epidemiology is a compelling epidemiologic framework that aims to model dynamic interactions
of people over their social networks in order to track infection cascades, especially for communicable diseases.
Network-based simulations in contact network epidemiology can incorporate variations in people’s attributes and
behaviors (e.g. age, race/ethnicity, wearing a facial mask), their interaction patterns (e.g. homophily or
assortativity), and social structures (e.g. social norms and policies including non-pharmaceutical interventions
[NPIs]). Although obtaining precise network data is challenging, it can guide us to identify potential working
network intervention strategies, which may prove beneficial in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Using the framework of network interventions, a pilot simulation study proposed alternative NPI strategies to the
stay-at-home order, in which transmission is mitigated while people’s socioeconomic activities are sustained
(Nishi et al, 2020, PNAS). In the most effective dividing + balancing groups strategy, a social group (e.g.
employees of the same workplace and students of the same school) is divided randomly into two subgroups with
an equal number to reduce the number of physical contacts. If it is operated in a spatial manner, additional space
for the subgroups is prepared; if it is operated in a temporal manner, the two subgroups will engage in their
activities during different business hours. Therefore, the strategy would allow people to engage in the same
magnitude of economic activities. The strength of the proposed strategy is that it does not require actual network
data, which is difficult to obtain in most cases.
Following the pilot study, this research seeks to create other novel NPI strategies for infectious disease control
(the targets are both COVID-19 and other emerging diseases) (Aim 1). This research also seeks to create novel
network intervention strategies for vaccine allocation (Aim 2). The proposed strategies for mitigating an epidemic
and optimizing vaccine allocation will not, in principle, require actual network data. Therefore, their potential
effect needs to be examined using network-based simulations with realistic assumptions or using other
approaches, including mathematical modeling. The utilized social network will be based on a sample city of
10,000 individuals (Nishi et al, 2020, PNAS) and various network structures that are publicly available (the use
of secondary data). Moreover, this research will analyze the role of early warning signals (EWS), which has been
developed in non-linear dynamical systems in the infectious disease control context. I plan to use the 76
California County COVID-19 data (Aim 3)."
10763816,"Abstract: Opioid and psychostimulant addictions are large and growing public health concerns that are
inadequately managed with available therapeutics. The objective of this proposal directly addresses this unmet
clinical need, as it includes the evaluation of a novel anti-addiction therapeutic strategy. A shared feature of
addictive drugs is their ability to induce inappropriate activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Restoration
of dopamine signaling homeostasis may be achieved by targeting the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1). NTR1 modulates dopamine signaling via action at putative NTR1/dopamine
receptor D2 (D2R) complexes. The efficacy of peptide or small molecule NTR1 agonists in animal models of
addiction have made them highly desirable but they all have side effects. NTR1, like other GPCRs, signals
through both G protein- and β-arrestin-mediated pathways. Recently, we have developed and characterized a
novel class of small molecule NTR1 ligands, typified by compound SBI-553, which activates β-arrestin without
stimulating G protein signaling. This type of functional selectivity/biased siganling presents an opportunity to
produce more directed physiological action and reduce unwanted side effects. My promising initial findings
suggest that SBI-553 attenuates opioid and stimulant-associated behaviors in mice without the hypotension and
hypothermia characteristic of unbiased NTR1 agonism. The objectives of this application are to elucidate the
mechanism by which β-arrestin biased NTR1 ligands attenuate drug-associated behaviors and validate their
therapeutic potential by integrating murine self-administration and functional neuroimaging. My central
hypothesis is that selective β-arrestin activation at NTR1 attenuates addiction-like behaviors and associated
changes in regional brain metabolism through antagonism of D2R function. This hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims, using SBI-553 as a tool compound. I will first (1) K99) define the behavioral effects
of β-arrestin biased NTR1 ligands by conducting self-administration studies in genetically engineered mice. I will
then (2) K99) determine the physiological effects of β-arrestin biased NTR1 ligands using state-of-the-art small
animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Finally, I will use my new training in
murine self-administration and PET/CT to independently (3) R00) evaluate the contribution of D2R to the effects
of β-arrestin biased NTR1 ligands. Pursuit of these aims requires interdisciplinary training in animal models
of addiction and neuroimaging to complement my previous studies in molecular biology. Therefore, I have
assembled expert collaborators into an interdisciplinary mentoring committee, chaired by Drs. Marc Caron
(Mentor) and Lawrence Barak (Co-Mentor). The Caron laboratory at Duke University is uniquely well-positioned
to answer questions regarding biased GPCR signaling. We have developed an individualized training plan
that will provide me with the scientific and professional skills required to run a productive, independent laboratory
and study addiction as a brain disease, including its neurological etiology and behavioral manifestations."
10763891,"Project Summary
 Antibody-mediated targeted immunotherapies are highly effective in killing cancer cells. T cell leukemias
and lymphomas, collectively known as T cell cancers, affect ~100,000 patients worldwide each year. Relapsed
T cell cancers respond poorly to aggressive chemotherapy with a 5-year survival between 7% to 38%. Thus, T
cell cancers particularly warrant antibody-mediated targeted immunotherapy to improve patient outcomes.
However, developing a T cell cancer targeting immunotherapy is challenging as the immunotherapy will have to
preserve enough healthy T cells to maintain a functioning immune system. T cells express the T cell receptor
(TCR) on the cell-surface. Although all T cells express TCR, they can be distinguished based on the TCR beta
chain constant region (TRBC) which is derived from one of two gene segments, TRBC1 or TRBC2. I led a team
that demonstrated that in healthy T cell populations, about 45% of cells express TRBC1 while the other 55%
express TRBC2. However, clonal T cell cancers express either TRBC1 or TRBC2 (Paul et al., Sci. Transl. Med.
2021). Thus, I hypothesize that antibody-mediated specific TRBC1 or TRBC2 targeting will eradicate the clonal
T cell cancers while preserving half of the healthy polyclonal T cell population. I also developed a TRBC1-
targeting bispecific antibody (αTRBC1) that selectively kills TRBC1+ T cell cancers (and TRBC1+ healthy T cells)
while preserving the healthy TRBC2+ T cells in vitro. These in vitro observations will require confirmation in
animal models before initiation of future human clinical trials. For Aim 1, I will determine the in vivo activity of the
αTRBC1 bispecific antibody. I will test the ability of αTRBC1 antibodies to induce tumor regression in multiple
mouse models of T cell cancers. I will then examine if the remaining healthy TRBC2+ T cells retain all of the
immune cell subsets required for a functioning immune system. I will also test if therapeutic pressure from the
αTRBC1 bispecific antibody will give rise to a low TCR expressing T cell population that will be resistant to
therapy. For Aim 2, I will test feasibility of TRBC2-targeting on T cell cancers. As a TRBC2-targeting antibody is
currently unavailable, I will use phage display to develop TRBC2-specific antibodies. I will then test the
cytotoxicity of TRBC2 targeting antibodies in vitro and in multiple mouse models of T cell cancers. Our TRBC-
directed antibodies will fill an unmet need for the treatment of T cell cancer patients. The proposed in vivo and
mechanistic studies will provide the pre-clinical validation required for the initiation of an early-phase human
clinical trials that will test the safety and efficacy of TRBC1- and TRBC2-targeting antibodies.
 My long-term goal is to become an independent laboratory-based physician-scientist focusing on
developing novel therapeutic approaches for T cell cancers. Through this proposal, I will also acquire the
research skills and career experience needed to reach this goal. These skills will be critical to the development
of a relevant, impactful translational research program in human T cell leukemias and lymphomas."

HIV infection among cisgender women who use drugs (WWUD) in the US South is a critical public health
issue. WWUD with diverse marginalized identities (e.g., Black heterosexual, White sexual minority) experience
intersectional stigma uniquely, which can result in HIV risk/protective behavior (e.g., condomless sex, social
support) and impact access to HIV prevention healthcare resources (PrEP). WWUD are PrEP indicated, but
their PrEP continuum outcomes (i.e. awareness, acceptability, uptake) remain low. WWUD have complex
proximal (e.g., syringe sharing) and distal (e.g., intersectional stigma experiences in healthcare settings) HIV
risk/resilience experiences that require further examination to develop effective interventions. Intersectionality
theory, undergirding this proposal, acknowledges interlocking power dynamics (e.g., racism) playing out in
social processes (e.g., intersectional stigma) to impact health outcomes and disparities. The proposed mixed-
method research aims to study HIV risk/resilience, healthcare barriers/facilitators, and PrEP continuum
disparities among WWUD in the US South, employing an intersectional strengths-based analytical lens to
inform multi-level stigma-reduction, HIV prevention, and PrEP promotion initiatives. To do so, I will first
describe HIV risk and PrEP continuum disparities by identifying WWUD subgroups based on intersectional
identity (i.e., race X sexual orientation) and contextual factors (e.g., sex exchange) using intersectional
quantitative approaches gained from training (e.g., latent class analyses) with southern National HIV
Behavioral Surveillance data (Aim 1). Next, I will explore multi-level barriers/facilitators (e.g., intersectional
stigma) in HIV prevention-related healthcare, HIV risk, and PrEP continuum via qualitative healthcare go-along
interviews with a purposively selected sample of PrEP indicated WWUD in New Orleans, LA (Aim 2).
Subsequently, I will explore institutional practices related to WWUD identified barriers/facilitators to HIV
prevention-related healthcare seeking, HIV risk, and PrEP continuum utilizing institutional ethnography (Aim 3).
This proposed research will facilitate application of training objectives towards my long-term career goal of
becoming an independent NIH-funded HIV prevention and health equity investigator. My career development
plan, including an expert team of mentors, (Drs. Latkin, Bowleg, Theall, German, Baral), centers the following
training objectives: 1) develop comprehensive expertise in intersectionality theory application, associated
mixed-methods study design approaches, and advanced ethnographic methodology (e.g., go-along
interviews); 2) develop advanced statistical theory and methods to conduct quantitative intersectionality
analyses(e.g., latent class analysis); 3) gain expertise in multi-level intersectional stigma theory and
ethnographic methods(e.g., institutional ethnographies); and 4) develop skills needed for a successful
academic career in intersectional mixed-method HIV prevention research with vulnerabilized populations (e.g.,
research bioethics, multi-stakeholder dissemination, grant writing; and interdisciplinary networking)."

 The Single Cell and Spatial Proteomics Core will provide access to highly multiplexed single
cell proteomic assays to reveal aging-related regulatory cell-states and their phenotypic identification and
localization. Based on innovative technologies pioneered in our lab, single cell mass cytometry (i.e.
CyTOF, for cell suspensions)1-2 and Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (i.e. MIBI, for nanometer-scale spatial
tissue imaging)3-5, the Core will provide deep cell state characterization of cell preparations and tissues
derived from the research projects during this grant cycle. Using elemental mass isotopes as reporters,
these technologies facilitate robust, inexpensive, single cell analyses quantifying 50+ features
simultaneously on millions of cells per experiment. We have had extensive experience applying these
technologies to derive deep phenotypic profiles of immune and intrinsic cells from numerous tissues,
including the hematopoietic1-2,6-9, central nervous system5,10-12, and muscle13-14. Besides cells
composition of these systems, we have routinely created and applied single cell assays to capture
functional and regulatory cell states, including: signaling1-2,6,8,15-17, cell cycle18-19, metabolism20, and
regulatory chromatin content4-5,14,21-22. All these established assays will be available to the research
projects and performed by the Core.
 The Single Cell and Spatial Proteomics Core will work with each project to create (spatial)
progenitor cell tissue atlases that captures deep cellular phenotypes and function with age,
focusing on single cell metabolic status and chromatin content. Overall, the products of these new
and integrated single cell assays will support the aims of Projects 1-3 for this funding cycle. These
include: integration of single cell metabolic and chromatin states with spatial localization in muscle
progenitor cells as they age (Project 1, Rando); spatial profiling of neural stem cell phenotypes with
metabolic use and chromatin modifications (Project 2, Brunet); tracking the phenotype and augmented
metabolism in aging and expanding hematopoietic progenitor cells along with the identity and localization
of their myeloid derivatives (Project 3 – Goodell).
 With novel single cell assay technologies, we have also established extensive computational
methods for single-cell analysis, including the first uses of principle component analysis (PCA)1,
stochastic neighborhood embedding (tSNE)23, spanning tree analysis of density normalized events
(SPADE, clustering/graphing)1,24, pseudo-time ordering (i.e. `cell clocks', Wanderlust)2, and spatial
enrichment approximation in imaging on highly multiplexed single cell data4,25-27. We will work closely

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, not only in pathophysiology, but also
at different disease progression stages. Despite numerous studies that have investigated the clinical utility of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based biomarkers in characterizing AD stages from asymptomatic to mildly
symptomatic to dementia, making a personalized precision prediction and early diagnosis of AD is still
challenging. Existing imaging biomarkers are limited in representing significant heterogeneity across different
individuals and at different clinical stages. This challenge originates from the lack of reliable brain landmarks that
can simultaneously characterize and represent robust population correspondences and individual variation
during normal aging and AD progression. In response, this project aims to: 1) Identify a set of brain anchor-
nodes as population landmarks based on both group-wise consistent patterns and individualized anatomical and
connectivity properties during normal aging and AD progression among massive, publicly available neuroimaging
data sources; 2) Develop an efficient individualized shape transformation approach based on deep learning to
map population anchor-nodes to individual brains by flexibly leveraging multimodal individual features; and 3)
Construct a progression tree using anchor-nodes derived brain measures to unveil and represent the wide
spectrum of AD development. Individual subjects can thus be projected to the tree structure to effectively and
conveniently access their clinical status and predict the trend of AD progression. We will test our new frameworks
on four large independent aging/AD cohorts including HCP-Aging, UK Biobank, ADNI and the latest stage of
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3), and freely release our computational tools and processed
data to the public."

The Yukon-Kuskokwim (YK) Delta of Alaska is home to 58 Alaska Native Tribes who experience
a life expectancy 10 years less than the U.S. average. Disparities in diet-related diseases, such
as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes contribute to this decreased life expectancy; structural
issues underlie these diet-related health disparities. Although the region is culturally tied to
healthy Native foods, a traditional lifestyle has become more difficult. Food retailers stock
unhealthy, shelf-stable food, while perishable foods, like produce, are scarce and unaffordable.
Food insecurity results in hunger, poor diet quality, and health disparities.
This project, Neqkiuryaraq or The Art of Preparing Food, is a food system structural intervention
for the YK Delta. Through multi-sectoral partnerships, community-engaged approaches, and
traditional knowledge, we will localize the food system and improve access to nutritious foods.
Structural interventions will promote the harvesting and distribution of traditional foods and
healthy market foods, like produce, to communities experiencing food insecurity.
Improved access to nutritious, culturally acceptable foods will bolster food security, reduce
hunger, and improve health. We will assess these effects by measuring participant food
security, diet quality, and clinical parameters such as blood pressure and blood sugar. Improved
nutrition will protect people against chronic health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and
cancer. Building a local food system that integrates traditional knowledge, promotes healthy and
culturally acceptable foods, and employs community members will move the YK Delta towards
food sovereignty and provide an exemplar for other rural communities facing food insecurity."

the G4C2 sequence lead to neurodegeneration of specific neurons is incompletely understood. G4C2 RNA is
transcribed in both sense and antisense directions and both RNA strands can undergo an unusual type of
translation called Repeat Associated non-AG dependent translation (RANT). RANT of the sense and antisense
G4C2 RNA produces five distinct dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), two of which (PR and GR) confer strong
toxicity in multiple model systems. To better understand the pathogenesis of C9orf72-mediated FTD, we
generated C. elegans models expressing pure DPRs. Both PR and GR were toxic in worms and caused
neurodegeneration. To define genes and pathways causing toxicity, we performed an unbiased genetic
suppressor screen and discovered several highly conserved genes that blocked PR50 toxicity. One highly
conserved suppressor is the nuclear E3 ligase adaptor SPOP. SPOP is widely studied in cancer since SPOP
missense mutations are a major genetic cause of prostate and endometrial cancer. However, SPOP has never
been linked to a neurodegenerative disease until now. The role of SPOP in DPR toxicity is conserved, since
both SPOP genetic knockdown and an SPOP small molecule inhibitor blocks DPR toxicity in mammalian primary
neurons. One major SPOP target in cancer is BRD2/3/4, which are bromodomain-containing transcriptional
regulatory proteins. We found that inhibition of the BRD homolog bet-1 suppresses the ability of SPOP mutants
to protect against DPR toxicity. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the SPOP pathway, which is
currently being targeted for the treatment of cancer, may also underlie neurodegenerative pathology in C9
disease. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) determine whether DPRs directly interact with SPOP to modulate
known pathological pathways, such as defective nuclear transport and stress granule formation; 2) delineate the
mechanism by which SPOP, BRD, and possibly other substrates mediate DPR toxicity; and 3) determine if SPOP
is a ‘druggable’ target for neuroprotection against DPRs in mammalian neurons. Our studies will interrogate a
novel pathway associated with C9 disease using a diversity of approaches and experimental model systems.
The discovery of this novel ubiquitination system could lead to new therapeutic insights for this incurable form of
dementia."

Title: Asian Community-Led Health Equity Structural Intervention (Asian CHESI)
Asian Community Health Coalition (ACHC) is requesting funding for Asian CHESI, a community-
led, multisectoral partnership initiative to address structural barriers in healthcare access and
health disparities experienced by underserved diverse Asian Americans. The project will engage
ACHC coalition member organizations: over 35 Asian ethnic community/faith-based
organizations; 8 clinical providers/community health centers; 3 academic research partners with
long history of collaboration (e.g. Temple University Center for Asian Health and University of
Maryland School of Public Health); 4 health department and government affiliated agencies, and
Asian language media and legal law firm partners to plan, implement and disseminate Asian-
community-led structural interventions across U.S. Eastern region of metro Philadelphia, NJ, NYC
and DC/MD/VA. We engage this large multisectoral team of partners in a 10-year 3-Phase
process that includes intentional assessment of structural barriers, development of targeted
interventions to break-down systemic barriers, and data collection and analysis efforts to evaluate
adoption and implementation. Structural interventions will address financial, physical, language,
and cultural barriers experienced by Asian Americans and those compounded by limited
healthcare access policies, language resources, food security, community policing against anti-
Asian hate and capacity building for multilingual community health workers. Asian CHESI
specifically addresses barriers faced by Asian Americans that impact screening, monitoring, and
care of chronic health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer), treatment
of long COVID, and access to mental health care services. After conclusion of this 10-year project,
we will have a blueprint for a multi-factor model that can be replicated in other areas with large

Rejuvenation Technologies Inc. (RTI) is taking the next translational step following their recent highly successful
proof-of-concept rescue of multiple mouse models that mimic key pathological features of alcoholic hepatitis
(AH). AH is an acute form of alcoholic liver disease in which the clinical response to loss of the liver’s regenerative
capacity from long-term damage includes liver failure. AH occurs in ~1/3 of heavy and chronic drinkers, and its
severity increases with the amount and duration of alcohol consumption. AH patients overall have poor
prognoses and high short-term mortality, with a 1-year survival rate of 25–50%, while those with severe AH may
show features of acute-on-chronic liver failure and exhibit a 40–50% mortality rate at 1 month from presentation.
There were over 300,000 hospital admissions for AH in 2017, and AH hospital admissions increased by over
50% during the COVID pandemic due to increased alcohol consumption that is expected to impact AH
epidemiology for years to come. The only treatments are steroids, which are ineffective at reducing patient
mortality and can increase risk of infection. There is strong evidence that short telomeres play a causal role in
AH. Telomeres are the protective DNA tips of chromosomes essential for cell and liver health. Chronic liver injury
caused by excessive alcohol consumption induces continuous hepatocyte turnover, which causes rapid telomere
shortening. When telomeres become too short, hepatocytes senesce and secrete senescence-associated
secretory phenotype factors that activate hepatic stellate cells, causing them to become fibrogenic. Transient
telomerase to extend telomeres in the liver represents a promising strategy to modify AH progression. RTI has
invented a breakthrough treatment comprising: 1) the telomere-extending biologic telomerase (TERT) mRNA
and 2) a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vehicle that delivers mRNA to the liver with world-leading efficiency, transfecting
>99% of hepatocytes at very low doses (0.05 mg/kg), even in cirrhotic livers. During the Phase I SBIR project,
RTI demonstrated that intravenously (i.v.) injected TERT mRNA LNPs reduced high-grade inflammation by 60%,
senescence by 30%, and liver fibrosis by 38% and increased median survival by 42% in humanized telomere
length (TERT KO) mice with thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver disease. TERT mRNA LNPs reduced liver
fibrosis by 74%, infiltrating T-cells by 33%, and DNA damage in hepatocytes by 73% in a preliminary study of an
acute-on-chronic model of AH. For Phase II, RTI will advance this product by undertaking three specific aims: 1)
investigating drug pharmacology in an acute-on-chronic liver disease model, mimicking the proposed AH clinical
treatment scenario, 2) optimizing drug product and scaling up manufacturing, and 3) piloting large animal
toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution studies. This will provide critical efficacy and toxicology data to
support a pre-IND application, paving the way for IND-enabling studies and RTI’s first-in-human clinical trials of
TERT mRNA LNPs in AH patients. Should these prove successful, RTI will expand to other liver indications, as
shortened telomeres are a pathological hallmark of cirrhotic liver disease of any etiology."
10762948,"Replication-competent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) present in latently infected memory T cells
in HIV+ individuals is a major barrier to virus eradication, and in the history of the pandemic only two
individuals are thought to have been truly cured. There is, however, a small subset of HIV+ individuals who are
able to suppress viral replication to undetectable levels for years, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.
These individuals, termed 'elite controllers' or ECs have been intensively studied, and genome-wide
association studies indicate that virologic control is due to coding variants in the HLA-B class I molecule, but
that can explain only ~20% of the effect. This suggests that other, perhaps non-immune based mechanisms,
are responsible for the EC phenotype. We were interested in linking the EC phenotype to genetic or
transcriptional changes, and by studying nearly 200 ECs (and viremic controllers or VCs) we were able to
demonstrate that a subset of them have CD4+ T cells that are relatively resistant to R5-tropic viruses in single
cycle infectivity assays. This in vitro phenotype, seen in ~20% of all EC/VCs, was highly reproducible,
depended upon the method of T cell activation, not observed in macrophages, and reversed by the introduction
of CCR5, the R5 co-receptor. This phenotype of in vitro R5 virus resistance inversely correlated with both
mRNA and protein levels of CCR5 and CCR2, the latter being the closest homolog to CCR5 and just 10 kb
upstream. The effect, however, extended for hundreds of kb surrounding ccr5/ccr2. Family members of Index
ECs with this phenotype had similar decreases in both ccr5 and ccr2 RNA levels, suggesting an autosomal
dominant inheritance pattern. ccr5 and ccr2 RNA half-lives were identical to those of non-resistant ECs,
suggesting that the effect was not post-transcriptional in nature, and ChIP data were consistent with a
transcriptional effect. Here we wish to further explore the mechanism(s) underpinning this phenotype. In the
first aim we will determine how both ccr5 and ccr2 are transcriptionally regulated in primary CD4+ T cells. We
will perform an unbiased CRISPR KO screen in primary T cells to identify genes which regulate ccr5/ccr2.
Chromosome conformation capture methods will be used to identify putative enhancers for the ccr5/ccr2 loci,
confirmed by functional studies, including use of advanced CRISPR/dCas9 techniques. We will also examine
the molecular basis of CD4 T cell resistance to replication-competent virus, since we have observed profound
inhibition of X4 virus in CD4+ T cells of these ECs. This will include KO of up-regulated restriction factors and
other genes, as seen by RNA-Seq. Finally, in an ongoing collaboration with Makerere University in Kampala,
Uganda we wish to extend these studies to East Africans, who are genetically distinct from our cohorts. CD4+
T cells from EC/VCs will be analyzed as described above to identify potentially novel mechanisms of host
genetic control. At the conclusion of these studies we hope to have a more complete understanding as to how
these EC/VCs are able to control viral replication and achieve functional cure while retaining immune function."
10762949,"Project Summary/Abstract: Declining cognitive function is a hallmark feature of the aging process in the
elderly population. Since aging is the major risk factor for many leading causes of death, including dementias
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), novel targets and strategies are needed as this population grows in the US
and beyond. Though the conventional view has held that plasticity is limited in the aged brain, emerging data
has challenged this notion, revealing that factors present within young blood are restorative for aged tissues
throughout the body while suggesting links between the systemic environment and aging- and Alzheimer's-
related changes in the brain. Aged mice sharing young blood via the parabiosis model or through plasma
transfer exhibit improved synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine number, and cognitive performance, which led me
to explore novel brain activities for systemic protein factors that may have relevance for AD. Our recently
published work uncovered tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), a protein enriched in
developmentally-early human and young mouse plasma versus aged plasma that plays a surprisingly central
role in regulating synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. I showed that treatment with TIMP2 significantly
revitalizes hippocampal function, as assessed by gene expression, long-term potentiation, and memory
performance in hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. Moreover, removing TIMP2 from hippocampal slices
dramatically reduced LTP and its loss in plasma ablated cognitive improvements conferred by young plasma.
This work has nonetheless left many fundamental questions open related to TIMP2's function within the
hippocampus, and its role in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. Recent work shows significantly
reduced TIMP2 levels in AD patients with vascular changes in CSF and altered levels of TIMP2 target MMP2
in plasma; our preliminary data support a perturbation of TIMP2 metabolism in plasma in mouse models of AD
pathology. We also find that TIMP2 expression decreases within dentate gyrus mossy cells important for the
LTP response. In this work, we will probe the mechanism by which CNS TIMP2 directly regulates hippocampal
function and the extent to which TIMP2 regulates hippocampal function in AD via changes in synaptic integrity
as well as amyloid-β (Aβ)-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesize that TIMP2 regulates synaptic function in
the normal hippocampus and is restorative in the context of AD pathology, primarily by acting to maintain
synaptic integrity. We will address this hypothesis in three major aims: (1) To assess functional effects in mice
in which hippocampal TIMP2 has been targeted and to evaluate the contribution of its source in mossy cells to
plasticity, (2) to assess the role of canonical and putative TIMP2 targets within the hippocampus, (3) and to
investigate the role of TIMP2 and related pathways in amyloid-independent and amyloid-dependent
mechanisms of AD pathology. Our aims will interrogate the function of TIMP2, a novel molecule with pro-
plasticity roles in the hippocampus, having implications for development and creation of AD therapies."

 Cellular plasticity, a feature associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributes
to tumor cell survival, migration, invasion, and therapy resistance. Across human cancer, tumors that are high
grade, poorly differentiated, and have undergone EMT carry a worse prognosis with a high likelihood of
metastasizing to distant organs. EMT is a common feature associated with tumor progression and is thought
to be critical to cancer cell dissemination in some tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA). PDA is a lethal and poorly understood human malignancy that is characterized by an activating
mutation in KRAS. Additionally, AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), has been implicated in tumor
progression, metastasis, therapy resistance, and EMT in multiple cancer types including PDA. During my
dissertation studies, I have found that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a critical downstream effector of
mutant active KRAS, is central to AXL-driven EMT in KRAS-mutant PDA. However, the mechanism of how
TBK1 drives EMT has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize that TBK1 drives EMT via activation of AKT3
and the stability of downstream transcriptional networks. My data demonstrate that AKT3 is activated
downstream of TBK1 in response to stimulation of AXL, which leads to the binding of AKT3 and Slug in an
AXL-TBK1 dependent manner. To complete my dissertation, I will establish the function of AKT3 in driving EMT
downstream of Axl and TBK1 with the following goals: 1) Establish the necessity of AKT3 for Axl and TBK1 driven
EMT; 2) Evaluate EMT transcription factors engaged downstream of TBK1 and 3) Determine the effect of AKT3
activation on the stability of EMT transcription factors.
 Despite significant evidence that EMT directly contributes to tumor progression, several studies have
suggested EMT is not required for the metastatic spread of PDA and breast cancer. For example, most
metastatic lesions are known to exhibit epithelial features, an observation that seems to be at odds with
EMT as a prerequisite for metastasis. As such, the importance of EMT in cancer biology h as been
questioned. I hypothesize that the chronic activation of an EMT program within a tumor may depend on
paracrine signals within the tumor microenvironment, dictating whether the tumor cells undergo EMT or
MET. Because these cells exist in a plastic state, it is possible that these tumor cells readily revert their
phenotype based on a microenvironment-specific context and factors. Additionally, current in vivo lineage-
tracing technology has not settled the debate between the importance of collective m igration and/or EMT
for metastatic dissemination. During my postdoctoral research, I aim to investigate the role of EMT in
metastasis using in vivo lineage tracing, single-cell sequencing, and organoids to better understand
epithelial plasticity in an oncogene- and tissue-specific manner. Understanding this process will aid in the
development of effective metastatic cancer therapies and will direct future research directions in metastasis."

This US-China collaborative study will leverage extensive data and archived biospecimens from two well-
established prospective birth cohorts: one in Boston, US; and the other in Shanghai, China, to examine the
temporal and dose-response relationships between maternal exposure to Hg at critical developmental windows
(preconception and specific trimesters) and child cardio-metabolic outcomes from birth to age 21 years. This
proposal has a strong scientific premise. Hg is a persistent and widespread environmental pollutant
worldwide and a known neurotoxicant at high doses, and its role in cardio-metabolic health is beginning to be
recognized. Studies in adults have suggested that low dose Hg exposure was associated with cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, and obesity. A critical unanswered question is whether maternal prenatal low dose Hg
exposure can have a long-lasting impact on the developing fetus. This proposal presents a prime opportunity
for a US-China collaboration on environmental health since US and China are among the top emitters of Hg in
the world. This proposal focuses on the effect of in-utero Hg exposure on child’s long-term cardio-metabolic
health, which is novel, important, and critically needed, given Hg’s ability to cross the placenta and the well-
documented fetal bioaccumulation of Hg. Our preliminary data showed a very high correlation of maternal-cord
blood Hg and a dose-response relationship between maternal Hg levels and child BMI and blood pressure.
These findings raise the hypothesis that maternal low dose prenatal exposure to Hg affects fetal future cardio-
metabolic health and warrant further investigation. This proposal uses vigorous scientific methods. Both
the US and China lack clear and effective strategies to reduce the adverse health effects of low dose Hg
exposure. We plan to evaluate to what extent maternal micronutrient status (e.g., folate) counteracts the
adverse effects of Hg exposure on child cardio-metabolic outcomes based on our preliminary data.
Furthermore, motivated by our preliminary data that maternal Hg exposure can alter both maternal and fetal
circulating metabolomic profile, we will explore maternal and fetal metabolome to gain novel insight to
mechanistic pathways. This proposal provides an exceptional platform for US-China scientists to leverage
resources and expertise on both sides. The two cohorts can serve as a discovery and replication cohort for
each other as well as meta-analysis, using a similar study design and outcome and covariate definitions; and
same laboratory and quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures and statistical methods. By doing so,
it greatly enhances our ability to test the study hypotheses and make the study findings far more generalizable
and impactful. This proposal has significant clinical and public health implications. It represents a
significant step forward in elucidating the roles of prenatal exposure to low dose Hg and micronutrients in child
long-term cardio-metabolic outcomes, as well as the potential mechanisms. If successful, it can serve as a
model to rigorously investigate other early life environmental exposures."

The family of monooxygenase enzymes are utilized to perform oxidative group transfer catalysis to broadly drive
one of two functions: (1) metabolize hydrocarbon building blocks (e.g., steroids, fatty acids) for waste
management or hormone synthesis in cytrochrome P450 (CYPs); and (2) the utilization of methane as the sole
carbon and energy source (i.e., methanotrophic bacteria). The common trait amongst the oxidizing enzymes is
the ability to electronically tune their catalytic centers to achieve oxygen transfer to robust C–H bond substrates.
Adapting the electronic structure tuning principles to devise new synthetic, abiological catalysts holds great
promise to (1) understand how the enzymatic systems might function by uncovering what reaction sequences
are possible, and (2) developing new catalytic reactions that mimic the reactivity of the monooxygenases.
 This proposal describes the synthesis and characterization of novel metal-ligand multiple-bonds and
metal-stabilized radicals to mimic the function of biological monooxygenases. Monooxygenases utilize metal-
oxenoid ligands to drive C−H bond activation and C−heteroatom bond formation, providing a blueprint on how to
emulate this reactivity. The ability to selectively incorporate functionality into unactivated C–H bonds represents
a significant advance in converting inexpensive chemical feed stocks (e.g. hydrocarbons) to value-added
functional molecules (e.g., pharmaceutical precursors). To achieve this goal, this proposal outlines a strategy to
generate metal-ligand multiply-bonded complexes featuring oxenoid functionalities and examine their reaction
chemistry as a function of transition metal and oxenoid ligand redox state. This proposal seeks to address the
following questions: (1) Which transition metal-oxo linkage and attendant electronic structure can facilitate C-H
bond hydroxylation chemistry? (2) Can monomeric copper support a terminal oxo-like ligand as would be
suggested for the reactive oxidant in particulate methane monooxygenases? (4) How do functional group
oxidation states (i.e., oxo, oxyl, oxene) impact functional group transfer catalysis? (5) Can metal-stabilized ligand
radicals in general be developed to enable new C-H bond functionalization catalysis?
 Using dipyrrin ligand platforms as truncated models of the porphyrin platform found in cytochrome
monooxygenases, this proposal outlines a strategy to synthesize and characterize metal-ligand multiple bonds
on iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. A sterically encumbered dipyrrin is proposed to be ideal for the synthesis,
crystallization, and full spectroscopic characterization of a terminal oxenoid adducts of Cu akin to the potential
terminal Cu(O) adduct in particulate methane monooxygenase. The broader scientific impact of the proposed
research can be summarized as the following: this study will improve the field’s understanding of factors
contributing to the promotion of productive C–H bond activation and functionalization, further developing new
catalysts to synthesize value-added, commodity chemicals via clean reaction routes with minimal waste product."

 Naïve lymphocytes exist in a quiescent state until becoming activated by antigen. Their continued
survival depends on signals they receive through their antigen receptors and from homeostatic cytokines.
How naïve lymphocytes respond to pro-survival signals while continually maintaining quiescence is unclear.
This is an important issue: enhanced responses to survival signals can fuel malignant transformation while
impaired quiescence can trigger spontaneous immune activation and immune failure. We have recently
discovered a new protein complex containing phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein-1 (Pacs1) and WD
repeat protein 37 (Wdr37) that is required for normal lymphocyte survival and quiescence. Mice lacking
Pacs1 or Wdr37 were deficient in circulating B and T cells. Pacs1-Wdr37-deficient B cells exhibited
spontaneous proliferation in vivo coupled with increased apoptosis which indicated loss of cellular
quiescence. These cells demonstrated increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress in vitro and were
hypersensitive to oxidative stress. Importantly, Pacs1-Wdr37 deficiency did not impair humoral immune
responses. However, it potently suppressed lymphoproliferative diseases resulting from blocked apoptotic
pathways. Mechanistically, deletion of Pacs1 or Wdr37 impaired antigen receptor-dependent calcium (Ca2+)
release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to transcriptional downregulation of ER Ca2+ release
channels (inositol triphosphate receptors, IP3R). These results lead us to hypothesize that Pacs1-Wdr37
integrates antigen receptor-dependent Ca2+ signaling and cellular stress responses to promote lymphocyte
survival and quiescence. We will test this hypothesis by (i) elucidating how disruption of Pacs1-Wdr37
diminishes B cell survival and quiescence; (ii) defining how Pacs1-Wdr37 prevents ER stress and promotes
IP3R expression; and (iii) validating Pacs1-Wdr37 disruption as a therapeutic approach to B cell
malignancies.
Relevance to public health:
Signaling networks that permit lymphocyte survival are often co-opted during malignant transformation.
There is a need for therapies that subvert pro-survival signaling in diseased lymphocytes while preserving
most beneficial immune functions. This proposal will investigate a novel protein complex involved in
promoting lymphocyte survival and quiescence while preventing cell stress that is a promising therapeutic
target for lymphoid malignancies."

 Metastasis is a feature of advanced disease whereby tumor cells spread to distant parts of the body,
and is responsible for the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. Unfortunately, targeted therapies often aren’t
effective in controlling metastatic disease, as tumors cells have been observed to employ a variety of
mechanisms to metastasize. Therefore, many have begun to look to the surrounding microenvironment as a
potential therapeutic avenue. Previous studies investigating the tumor immune microenvironment have
identified monocytes as important mediators of metastatic progression. However, recent single cell
transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that monocytes are a heterogeneous population of cells, and the
role of specific subsets of monocytes in metastasis remains poorly understood. Preliminary work from the
Goga lab has identified a novel subset of metastasis-associated monocytes with a discrete metabolic and
phenotypic transcriptional profile. This proposal seeks to investigate the impact of metabolism on metastasis-
associated monocytes and interrogate their role in the lung metastatic niche. We believe that a better
understanding of the vulnerabilities of different subsets of immune cells will lead to new therapeutic targets for
metastatic cancer.
 The proposed research training will take place at UCSF, a top-tier research institution and medical
center at the cutting edge of cancer immunology research. The Biomedical Sciences program at UCSF
provides a rigorous education in translational biology and science communication which prepares students to
become future leaders in their fields. Under the mentorship of Dr. Andrei Goga, a practicing oncologist and
expert in breast cancer metastasis, I am well poised to carry out the proposed research which will leave me
with a broad experimental and computational skillset. Additionally, the training plan we have developed for the
remainder of my thesis work places a strong emphasis on developing my teaching and mentoring skills, as well
as my communication skills through various opportunities to present my work to the scientific community. This
training, coupled with the experience I will gain in carrying out the proposed research, will leave me equipped
for a future career in academia studying cancer metastasis as an independent investigator."

The medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) plays a vital role in spatial navigation, learning, and
memory. Many neurons in layer II/III of the mEC exhibit spatially tuned firing rates that generate
a grid-like (‘grid cells’) pattern when traversing an open field. Grid cell firing rates are modulated
by a theta (4-12 Hz) frequency, network-wide oscillation generated via input from the medial
septum. Further, higher frequency gamma (40-140 Hz) oscillations are nested within the slower-
wave theta oscillation and are believed to help synchronize grid cell spike output. Several
studies have demonstrated that grid cells are largely connected through a dense network of
fast-spiking interneurons which are critical for the generation of gamma oscillations. However,
the functional network connectivity between putative grid cells and fast-spiking interneurons in
the mEC, which generate theta-nested oscillations during spatial navigation, are not fully
understood. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings remain the standard for measuring intracellular
membrane voltage and current, but this technique has relatively low throughput. Recent
advances in fluorescent voltage indicators have enabled the imaging of both action potentials
and subthreshold activity from tens of neurons during optogenetic stimulation. We propose
utilizing the sensitivity of whole-cell voltage clamp recordings to capture network synaptic
activity in stellate, pyramidal and fast-spiking interneurons during optogenetic stimulation of
different local excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. Following this, we will determine the
spike timing of excitatory and inhibitory neurons relative to theta-nested gamma oscillations in
the local field potential by imaging intracellular voltage in a densely labeled population during
optogenetic stimulation of local excitatory neurons. The combination of these techniques will
establish the functional input/output of each cell type necessary for developing and testing
potential canonical models of grid cell activity and network synchrony during spatial navigation.
The proposed research will be conducted at Boston University in the Rajen Center for
Integrated Life Sciences which is home to a multidisciplinary community of neuroscience
investigators. This institute combines experts from the Center for Systems Neuroscience and
the Neurophotonics Center which fosters a diverse collaborative environment to tackle
challenging research projects. Further, the development of my academic training, technical
skills, scientific communication, professional skills, and consistent mentorship will ensure the
success of this project."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality for adults in
the United States. The number of patients needing surgical management for this condition is expected to nearly
double over the next 30-years. Patients with symptomatic PAD are referred to vascular surgeons who have two
potential treatment options: operative management via revascularization or non-operative management via
supervised exercise therapy. Despite symptomatic relief as the primary goal for treatment, there are no objective
outcomes used in PAD care to reflect patient’s perspective. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are
validated, robust tools that objectively measure patient outcomes from the patient perspective and help deliver
patient-centered care. PROMs are used to monitor health changes across other medical conditions and contexts,
the utility of PROMs in patients with PAD has not been well-established. Traditionally, vascular surgeons have
used objective metrics, like ankle-brachial index (ABI) blood flow measurements, to evaluate progress and
determine the success of an intervention. Despite the widespread availability of PROMs, it is presently unclear
how these metrics can be used to in the clinic workflow and healthcare delivery of patients with PAD. The central
goal of this research is to develop a successful implementation strategy for PROMs as a patient voice
into routine clinical care for PAD. More specifically, we will examine how changes in physical function PROMs
and ABI influence each other dynamically over time (Aim 1.1) and then compare PROM changes over time for
physical function, depression, and social engagement in activities among operative and non-operative PAD
patients (Aim 1.2). Next, we will obtain patient perceptions and value of PROMs in PAD care using semi-
structured patient interviews (Aim 2). Finally, using a multilevel stakeholder advisory panel we will design a
strategy for implementing PROMs into routine clinical workflow for PAD patients using a modified-Delphi
approach (Aim 3). These data will provide essential contextual components (Aims 1 & 2) to help design a
successful strategy for PROMs (Aim 3) into routine clinical practice for patients with PAD. This work will lay the
foundation for future implementation efforts focused on use of PROMs at our institution and others. Our team is
uniquely qualified to carry out this research. We have prospectively collected PROMs since 2016 for research
and have the resources and clinical environment to implement changes in clinical practice. While executing these
aims, I will gain valuable knowledge using qualitative research methods, trajectory analysis, and established
implementation science frameworks. With the support of my mentorship team and the NRSA fellowship, I will
attain a unique skillset at the intersection of implementation science, surgery, and patient care that will provide
a solid foundation for future success as a vascular surgeon-scientist."

Glioblastoma is a grade IV diffuse astrocytoma, the deadliest and most common form of adult brain cancer.
Standard of care extends survival by approximately 1-18 months, with the poorest benefits being seen by elderly
patients (>70yrs). New forms of immune-based therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), may turn
the corner in treatments for primary and recurrent glioblastoma. Unfortunately, no clinical trial so far has shown
major benefits in either survival or immune engagement for these patients. Recent findings suggest that gliomas
harbor multiple and intertwined cellular sources of immune suppression that dampen ICI-initiated responses.
Thus, one solution may be to not only enhance effector T cells by blocking checkpoints such as CTLA-4 and PD-
1, but to also target the immune suppressive niches in glioblastoma, the largest of which is comprised of glioma-
associated microglia and macrophages (GAMs). In fact, GAMs are a highly attractive target and have been
depleted in pre-clinical and clinical studies via CSF1R inhibition (PLX3397). This approach, however, yielded
mixed responses in models and no response in patients. Another path may be to reprogram GAMs, but we lack
insights into the pathways that promote anti-tumor GAMs. Therefore, identifying the cellular and molecular
regulators of pro- and anti-tumor GAM states is the next step in unlocking new therapeutic avenues. Recent work
by the Kaech lab showed that CTLA-4 blockade in orthotopic mouse models of glioblastoma reduced regulatory
T cell (Treg) infiltration, increased ‘helper’ Th1 cell infiltration, and microglia exposed to Th1 cell-derived IFNg
were reprogrammed into an antigen presenting (MHCII+), tumor-phagocytosing (AXL+/MER+) state; in concert,
these effects significantly increased survival. This proposal will investigate how GAMs, especially the brain
resident microglia, acquire and maintain distinct functional states with the hypothesis that Treg-specific signaling
sustains tumor-promoting GAMs during glioblastoma progression while Th1 T cells induce tumor-killing GAMs
during an effective ICI-initiated response. Two specific aims are proposed to interrogate this hypothesis. The first
aim will employ single-cell spatial transcriptomics to address whether Tregs and Th1 cells are extrinsic regulators
of GAM states through direct contact and/or secretory signaling, and whether these interaction axes exist in
human glioblastoma. The second aim will define the intrinsic AXL/MER and related pathways regulating GAM
state ‘switching’. In summary, this work will better inform GAM-targeting interventions by defining how infiltrating
T cells and GAM-intrinsic signaling pathways coordinate the dynamic biology underlying pro- and anti-tumor
GAM states. This application outlines the applicant’s proposed training plan, which includes diverse and
multidisciplinary research mentorship, training in cutting-edge and advanced techniques, and development of
broader scientific skills such as collaboration and effective communication. The research and training outlined in
this proposal will prepare the applicant to conduct innovative, rigorous, and impactful research."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and over $6B in annual hospitalization costs
among the nearly 6 million US adults it affects. AF is a cardiac arrhythmia which can cause blood to collect in
the atria and form clots that travel to the brain resulting in a stroke. Efforts to reduce rates of stroke related to
AF are limited by rudimentary stroke risk stratification tools and disparities in care. There is a critical need for
personalized, socially aware, equitable stroke risk prediction among patients with AF to enable optimal
implementation of contemporary stroke-prevention therapies.
The objective of this proposal is to use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods to capture and
quantify synergies among known and newly discovered AF risk factors in socioeconomic contexts. My central
hypothesis is that stroke prevention can be improved through methods that leverage computational methods
on large datasets augmented with information on social determinants of health (SDoH). Preliminary studies by
our group and others have revealed subgroups of patients for whom SDoH factors are critical for accurate risk
stratification. Aim 1 is to discover new risk-factor relationships for patients with AF that include SDoH data,
using an innovative comorbidity discovery framework (Poisson Binomial Comorbidity Discovery). Aim 2
focuses on building models that combine the variables identified in Aim 1 with established risk factors to predict
outcomes using AI methods. To do so, I will build novel Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) to understand
the impact of SDoH and newly identified factors on AF-related stroke risk.
The primary innovation in this proposal is employing novel analytic approaches to understand and reduce
disparities in AF risk prediction models. The proposal aims to provide means for improved care across the
spectrum of patients with AF and address disparities in the present standard of care. The AI tools created will
be readily accessible and interpretable by clinicians and patients to help guide individual treatment decisions.
Completion of this proposal will yield a personalized and equitable approach to stroke prevention in the context
of AF.
This project provides multidisciplinary computational and clinical training augmented with mentorship from
experts in both domains. The outlined training will provide me with the computational and translational
cardiology experiences required to succeed as an independent investigator and physician-scientist."
10754263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ethical conduct of Phase 1 trials is conditioned on both there being a reasonable ratio between potential
risks and benefits and research candidates being provided with key information about that potential during the
informed consent process. IRBs must carefully assess the scientific information supporting the assessment of
potential risks and benefits in order to meet these conditions. Several hurdles hinder such assessment. While
the FDA carefully vets preclinical safety data that relate to Phase 1 trials, the same is not true for the preclinical
efficacy data needed to support the potential for benefit. Further, IRBs receive no specific guidance regarding
what to look for in preclinical efficacy data or how they should vet scientific claims made about Phase 1
modalities. This lack of guidance is disconcerting given extensive research documenting characteristics of
many preclinical efficacy studies that make it difficult to make reliable inferences about whether a new
treatment modality might eventually be capable of demonstrating clinical efficacy. Such inferences are
especially challenging when it comes to preclinical efficacy studies that employ novel research techniques like
CRISPR-Cas9 and brain organoids. Knowing what inferences about potential efficacy can reliably be made
about new treatment modalities employing novel preclinical tools will be the primary focus of our project. These
are the very inferences that are required if IRBs are to be able to determine that there is a reasonable ratio
between benefits and risks in Phase 1 trials employing new promissory technologies. In this challenging
setting, IRBs could benefit from a structured approach to risk/benefit assessments. This project is designed to
develop and pilot such an approach. To do this, we will conduct quantitative and qualitative research to learn
about current strengths and weaknesses in IRB review of Phase 1 studies. We will complete a national survey
of IRB chairs. Then we will conduct 3 sets of semi-structured interviews with: (a) past Phase 1 trial
investigators, (b) IRB members who review Phase 1 trial applications, and (c) past participants or their legal
representatives of Phase 1 trials. We will use these findings to refine an existing conceptual framework for
assessing the quality and reliability of efficacy data in preclinical studies. From this refined conceptual
framework, we will develop IRB and investigator checklists designed to (a) promote highly-structured weighing
of potential benefits and risks by IRBs in Phase 1 trials and (b) assist Phase 1 investigators to submit more
ethically robust Phase 1 trial applications. We will also develop a novel data analytics and decision-support
interactive software platform to help Phase 1 investigators and IRB members evaluate the evidentiary context
surrounding a given Phase 1 trial. These decision aids will also be used to identify critical disclosures about
potential risks and benefits to Phase 1 trial research candidates. To see if our decision aids might produce
these desired benefits, in the final year of our project we will pilot them with Phase 1 investigators and IRB
members."

As the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continues to increase and drugs targeting traditional disease
etiology have thus far failed, it is critical to approach this devastating disease from different perspectives.
Neural stem cells (NSC) have thus emerged as a potential therapeutic. Neural stem cells (NSCs) play a critical
role in learning, mood, and memory by continuing to generate newborn neurons throughout life in the dentate
gyrus of the hippocampus. This process of neurogenesis is impaired early in age and in Alzheimer’s disease.
In addition, NSC numbers are correlated with AD outcome in humans and modulation of neurogenesis in
mouse models can contribute to cognitive impairment or improvement. Thus, there remains a need to
understand why NSC become dysfunctional and how to rejuvenate them for therapeutic use. To address these
questions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing upon young and old NSCs. We uncovered a gene
network that older NSCs are unable to activate. Our lab discovered a compound predicted to activate this
gene network and tested it in old mice. This compound can sustain high levels of NSC activation while
increasing NSC pool size, neurogenesis, and cognition. These effects are unforeseen in NSC biology and
reveal a novel regenerative capacity of NSCs without triggering depletion nor deepened quiescence. My
preliminary data suggest that this drug uniquely targets a chromatin remodeling factor that is central in this
identified gene network. Correlative evidence and existing literature further support this. Thus, I hypothesize
that knockdown of this factor in young mice via lentivirus will recapitulate phenotypic effects of NSC aging (Aim
1) whereas overexpression of this factor is sufficient to promote NSC rejuvenation (Aim 2). This would provide
support our compound works through targeting this factor and would establish mechanistic understanding of
why NSCs decline in age and how to target them for rejuvenation in Alzheimer’s. The extensive use of
immunohistochemistry, surgical techniques and associated computational training establish this project as an
ideal training opportunity. This training plan incorporates acquisition of diverse skills in stem cell biology and
neuroscience, specialized coursework in bioinformatics, the honing of presentation and writing skills, and
career development that will help me achieve my goal of becoming a successful independent scientist in brain
aging. My mentor, Dr. Michael Bonaguidi, has an exceptional training record and has been instrumental in the
neurogenesis and NSC field. The Bonaguidi lab is located within the rapidly growing Broad Stem Cell Institute
at USC, which is a highly collaborative and dynamic environment for my scientific development."
10975031,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ischemic heart disease affects more than 197 people worldwide every year. Despite advances in macro
revascularization techniques such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention,
many patients progress to heart failure due to residual microvascular perfusion deficits. Although the adult human
heart appears to be unable to significantly regenerate myocardium after injury, neonatal mice and pigs are
capable of efficient angiogenesis and myocardial regeneration during the first week of life. Endogenous
angiogenic and regenerative pathways are intricately linked to the wound-healing inflammatory cascade,
extracellular matrix remodeling, endothelial cell migration, and cardiomyocyte proliferation. Consequently, the
infarct border zone, which is the spatial intersection of these cellular processes, has proven to be a complex and
dynamic microenvironment to investigate. In this proposal, we describe a novel application of a multiplexed
immunofluorescent imaging platform with single cell resolution called CODEX (co-detection by indexing) which
was developed here at Stanford. With the guidance and mentorship described in the research training plan, we
have compiled an advisory committee of physician and surgeon-scientists, cardiologists, cell biologists, and the
experts in CODEX from Stanford's Cell Sciences Imaging Facility. If awarded this Fellowship, this
multidisciplinary team is uniquely positioned to execute this first of its kind application of CODEX to myocardial
regeneration. CODEX will be used to characterize the longitudinal changes in the spatiotemporal relationship
between the resident cells of the myocardium and the paracrine pathways that govern angiogenesis and
myocardial regeneration. CODEX is an extension of immunofluorescence microscopy that utilizes antibodies
conjugated to DNA barcodes to simultaneously quantify up to 44 antigens in situ. In Aim 1 we will apply CODEX
to neonatal mouse and pig LAD ligation models of myocardial regeneration to define novel spatial phenotypes
of angiogenic and inflammatory cellular neighborhoods throughout the neonatal period of regenerative potential
in comparison to non-regenerating adults. After characterizing the cellular microenvironments and cell-signaling
activity of natural angiogenesis in neonatal mammals, in Aim 2 we will investigate the effect of exogenous
modulators of angiogenesis and the acute inflammatory response in adult mice and pigs. As an animal model
for myocardial regeneration, the regulatory pathways that govern natural angiogenesis and subsequent
myocardial regeneration in the mouse and pig are the subject of great interest due to their potential therapeutic
benefit in humans. By using CODEX to study the complex interplay between multiple cell types, paracrine
signaling pathways, and intercellular processes we hope to advance our mechanistic understanding of natural
neonatal angiogenesis and myocardial regeneration and identify new therapeutic targets for ischemic heart
disease, which has the potential to advance the treatment of millions of patients worldwide who are suffering
from ischemic heart disease."
10910881,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The human X chromosome has long been hypothesized to play a significant role in the etiology of sex-biased
diseases and traits, particularly autoimmune diseases like lupus. Despite its importance, the X chromosome is
largely understudied in genetic association and functional genomics studies. Such an omission is largely due to
its unique biology. The hemizygosity of XY males necessitates XX females to achieve dosage compensation of
X-linked genes by the means of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Thus, in females most genes are expressed
only from the active X (Xa) and remain silent on the inactive X (Xi). However, up to 10% of genes consistently
escape XCI in healthy females and are transcribed from both Xa and Xi. And 15-30% of genes variably escape
XCI in a subset of females or tissues. We hypothesize such inter- and intra- individual heterogeneity is genetically
influenced and disease relevant. However, the genetic architecture of X-linked genes and XCI escape remains
poorly understood. We recently showed, for the first time, that XCI escape has significant heritability and variable
XCI escape genes have a significantly increased enrichment of heritability in female-biased traits when
compared to sex-balanced traits. Although promising, the annotations for XCI states were inferred only from
lymphoblast cell lines, which could differ across human tissue/cell types. Recent works have shown disease
heritability is enriched in regions surrounding genes specific to disease relevant tissues. Thus, matching each
trait to relevant tissue/cell type specific XCI states in heritability analysis could pinpoint the disease and trait
relevant tissue/cell types in which escape from XCI plays a significant role (Aim 1). To do so, we first propose
an empirical bayes method to infer XCI escape states in an individual sample invariant of XCI mosaicism or
presence of transcribed heterozygous SNPs in population scale bulk RNA-seq data. Unlike previous efforts, our
method maximizes the samples and X-linked genes assayed to construct the most comprehensive XCI escape
landscape across human tissue/cell types to date. Such a complete map will enable robust heritability estimation.
Next, to understand the genetic influence on variable XCI escape, we propose a two-step method that accurately
models XCI mosaicism and genetic regulation of Xa/Xi by jointly modeling male and female samples to detect
associations with Xa and Xi expression levels (Xa-/Xi- QTL) (Aim 2). Our method offers substantial advancement
and improves power to detect Xa-/Xi- QTLs compared to other approaches that 1) assume genetic regulation on
Xa and Xi are largely similar or 2) attribute total expression of X-linked genes to expression from Xa and Xi. We
will apply our approach across tissue/cell types and integrate the identified Xa-/Xi- QTL with existence genome
wide association studies to identify tissue/cell type specific Xa and Xi gene and trait associations. We will apply
our methods to some of the largest datasets for a variety of traits including lupus, diabetes, and addiction. Overall,
our proposed methods will allow comprehensive assessment of the role the X chromosome and XCI escape
plays in the etiology of diseases and traits, particularly those that are sex-biased like autoimmune diseases."

10745652,"As critical regulators of cellular metabolism, mitochondria activate various pathways in response to stressors
(e.g., aging) and dysfunction (e.g., unfolded proteins). However, little is known about the in vivo pathways
mitochondria use to communicate impaired energy production. Mitochondrial energy dysfunction is a hallmark
of a range of degenerative diseases affecting tissues with high energy demands, thus understanding how
mitochondria respond to energy dysfunction and direct the cellular response to energetic crisis in vivo is critical
for the design of targeted strategies to ameliorate these diseases. Here, we will leverage a unique model of in
vivo mitochondrial energy impairment that we engineered by inducible deletion of the cardiac mitochondrial
phosphate carrier (SLC25A3) in adult mouse cardiomyocytes. This model offers a novel system to model
mitochondrial energy impairment in a terminally differentiated tissue with high energy demands. Intriguingly,
despite the cardiac disease exhibited by these mice, SLC25A3 deficiency does not engage canonical
mitochondrial energy dysfunction pathways like AMPK and ROS signaling, nor is cell death or fibrosis exhibited
by deficient hearts. Instead, loss of SLC25A3 in adult hearts causes a striking increase in mitochondria-specific
protein acylations, particularly acetylation and malonylation. Acylations are dynamic post-translational
modifications derived from metabolic intermediates and subject to removal by sirtuin deacylases. Importantly,
acylations harbor the potential to link metabolism to protein functional regulation, while altered acylation is
associated with disease pathogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that, in particular, two aspects of the
acylome—the acetylome and the malonylome—are remodeled in response to mitochondrial energy
dysfunction. While the acylome is well known to regulate mitochondrial metabolism, our work suggests that the
converse is also possible: that mitochondrial energy dysfunction directs acylome remodeling. We hypothesize
that acylome modifications represent a mitochondria-intrinsic mechanism to coordinate the cellular response to
energy stress. Using the SLC25A3 deletion mice together with cell biology, biochemistry, proteomics, and
innovative in vivo gene therapy approaches, we will 1) identify the mechanisms underlying SLC25A3 deletion-
mediated acylome remodeling, 2) define how acylations regulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
cell death pathway, and 3) determine the physiological impact of aberrant acylations on the mitochondrial
energy-impaired heart. The proposed studies will provide novel insight on the link between mitochondrial
bioenergetics and acylome remodeling and position acylations as an arm of the mitochondrial stress response
that is activated upon mitochondrial energy dysfunction. Ultimately, identification of pathways regulating
mitochondrial dysfunction will facilitate the development of new therapies targeting mitochondrial energy
dysfunction in disease."
10754914,"Motor systems neuroscience seeks to understand the neural mechanisms behind voluntary movement. The last two
decades have witnessed a transformation in this ?eld with the use of multielectrode recordings and statistical estimation
and modeling techniques. These technological advances have yielded rich, low-dimensional neural dynamics that are
suggestive of the mechanisms underlying behavior. To minimize confounds, the overwhelming majority of these studies
utilize behavioral constraint to isolate just the behaviors of interest for study. While effective for generating many behav-
iorally similar trials, this may have the unintentional consequence of arti?cially constraining neural dynamics to a subset
of its full range.
This project seeks to better understand whether and how neural dynamics change with respect to the behavioral context
(constrained vs unconstrained) they occur in. This type of work has historically been challenging because capturing
limb kinematics in an unconstrained setting is non-trivial. However, with recent advances in computer vision technology,
accurate 3D cameras have become accessible tools for research. This study will leverage these new 3D cameras to capture
unconstrained behavior in a large observational enclosure. Novel algorithms for the processing of these 3D datasets will
be used to estimate the subject's pose. These limb kinematics will be synchronized and correlated against neural data
recorded from one or more 96-channel Utah electrode array(s) implanted in motor regions of cortex.
Low-dimensional neural dynamics can be generated from this synchronized data. The dynamics will be explored in the
context of two behaviors in the enclosure: walking and reaching for food on the ?oor. The dimensionality of the dynamics
in these two contexts will be compared, with the null hypothesis stating that there is no difference in dimensionality of
dynamics between these behavioral contexts. A subsequent experiment will be to again construct low-dimensional neural
dynamics, but this time include a context of behaviorally constrained reaching. The dynamics from these three contexts
will be compared to ?nd a common subspace (subset of dimensions) shared among all. This subspace, if it exists (the
null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the dynamics between the behavioral contexts), represents fundamental
dynamics that are invariant of the behavioral context, suggestive of causal necessity of this subspace.
Taken together, these studies will further our understanding of how low-dimensional neural dynamics drive motor be-
havior. This insight has implications for the development of ambulatory brain-machine interfaces and may inform the
treatment of individuals with motor disorders such as stroke."
10754915,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epilepsy is one of the common problems that can result after ischemic stroke in a child. Children with post-
stroke epilepsy have poorer cognitive outcomes, poorer quality of life and worse health measures. A better
understanding of the determinants of post-stroke epilepsy is needed. Children who have acute seizures (those
that occur within one week of the stroke) are more likely to develop epilepsy later in childhood, with a
cumulative epilepsy incidence of 58% by 10 years. Inflammation and infarct location are two potential links
between acute seizures and later development of epilepsy after pediatric stroke. Based on studies in animals
and prior work, acute seizures worsen the inflammation that occurs after a stroke; in turn, inflammation may be
an important mediator of epilepsy. Another possibility is that acute seizures are a marker of an injury to the
anatomic brain regions or networks that are epileptogenic. This ancillary study proposal will examine acute
seizures and post-stroke epilepsy in children who had a stroke (28 days of life up to 19 years of age at stroke
onset) who were enrolled in two separate cohorts. The two independent cohorts will be utilized as a discovery
and validation set. One cohort is from the completed VIPS I study of childhood stroke, and the second is from
the ongoing VIPS II study of childhood stroke. In Aim 1, the inflammatory signaling pathways activated by
acute seizures will be determined using banked blood collected from children after stroke, validating
preliminary work from the VIPS I cohort. In Aim 2, changes in inflammatory signaling pathways will be
identified in children who later develop epilepsy. Epilepsy outcomes will be ascertained in both cohorts.
Banked blood collected at several timepoints after the stroke will be utilized to determine differential expression
of analytes in those who develop epilepsy compared to those who do not. In Aim 3, lesion-symptom mapping
and lesion-network mapping will identify the brain regions and functional networks associated with post-stroke
epilepsy. Machine learning techniques will be used to integrate results from these three aims, creating models
that include relevant laboratory data, clinical data and imaging data. The “Seizures and Children's Outcomes
after Stroke (SCOUTS)” study is important because it will improve understanding of epilepsy after pediatric
stroke. The results will provide evidence for molecular and anatomic pathways associated with seizures and
epileptogenesis and will be used in future research of anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents to reduce the risk of
post-stroke epilepsy. The SCOUTS study will identify predictors of epilepsy to improve prognostication for
families and inform inclusion criteria in future trials. A rich dataset of longitudinal stroke outcomes will also be
a legacy of the study. The long-term objectives of this research are to find a treatment that can be given after a
child has a stroke to effectively improve recovery and prevent epilepsy."
10754916,"The long-term objective of this grant is to identify how to modulate αvβ3 integrin signaling
pathways in order to develop therapeutic targets to control intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. The
glaucomas, which lead to irreversible loss of retinal ganglion cells, affect approximately 67 million people
worldwide. They are commonly associated with elevated levels of intraocular pressure (IOP) due to a reduction
in aqueous humor outflow from the trabecular meshwork (TM). One of the major risk factors that has emerged
as an important regulatory mechanism for outflow facility is the actin cytoskeleton. It controls a number of key
biological processes involved in maintaining normal outflow facility including contractility, phagocytosis, and
deposition of the extracellular matrix. Integrins play a central role in regulating these cytoskeleton-mediated
activities and our studies suggest that dysregulation of the αvβ3 integrin causes the major phenotypic changes
associated with glaucoma including decreased phagocytosis, increased extracellular matrix deposition, CLAN
formation and an elevation in IOP. We propose that this integrin is activated in glaucoma by elevated levels of
TGFβ2 or following treatments with glucocorticoids, like dexamethasone (DEX).
 In this grant, we plan to use RNAseq studies to identify the factors upregulated by DEX or TGFβ2 that
activate αvβ3 integrin and proximity ligation assays to determine if these factors are associated with the
integrin adhesome. We also plan to demonstrate that an NRON/NFAT complex controls DEX-induced
activation of αvβ3 integrin and the secondary glucocorticoid response involved in steroid-induced glaucoma.
Finally, we plan to show that the responses to DEX (ECM formation, IOP elevation, and outflow facility) are
affected by the activated state of αvβ3 integrin in vivo, not just its expression level. To test this last hypothesis
we plan to use a tamoxifen inducible CreERcag-β3 integrinflox/flox mouse to knock down αvβ3 integrin
expression in the mouse TM. Adenoviral (Ad5) vectors expressing 3 different activated states of αvβ3 integrin
(wildtype, inactive and constitutively active) will be used to alter the activity levels of αvβ3 integrins in vivo.
 The proposed studies are the first to demonstrate that changes in a specific integrin signaling
pathway can affect IOP, outflow facility, and ECM formation in vivo. They will enhance our understanding
of how integrin signaling events are controlled in the TM and how this affects the cytoskeletal events (ECM
deposition, cell contractility and phagocytosis) that regulate outflow facility. Understanding how integrins
contribute to the regulation of these processes is important because it will enable us to provide new therapeutic
targets to regulate the cytoskeleton in order to restore homeostasis and decrease IOP."
10754925,"The proposed K01 application will strongly support Dr. Erik Kaestner's long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinically focused scientist using neurostimulation and cognitive neuroscience approaches to improve patients' cognitive function. Patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often undergo surgical resection or ablation of medial temporal structures (MTL) critical to memory to alleviate seizures. Consequently, up to 40% of surgical interventions end with significant memory decline post-surgery. Currently, there is no procedure that accurately predicts post-surgical memory decline. An opportunity is presented by standard pre-surgical workflow in which patients are implanted with electrodes for surgical planning and are often stimulated for seizure mapping. I propose an innovative method for predicting post-operative memory decline following surgery by using electrical stimulation to induce transient, functional lesions in the MTL during a memory test. Although stimulation parameters are established for mapping seizures, they have not yet been established for transient disruption to test memory. The targeted research project aims to: 1) map the spread of electrical stimulation in the brain to ensure spatial specificity for memory mapping and 2) develop a stimulation and memory test paradigm for the mapping of memory critical structures. This project is directly relevant to Aims III.2 and IV.2 of the 2020 NINDS Benchmarks for Epilepsy. The mentored research in this proposal will be supplemented with structured training activities that will enable Dr. Kaestner to achieve the following career goals: 1) develop expertise in the clinical applications of cognitive neuroscience to patient-oriented outcomes, 2) develop proficiency in the study design and conduct of neurostimulation approaches, and 3) professional development in the conduct of high-impact translational research. To facilitate the successful completion of these training objectives and career goals, Dr. Kaestner has assembled an accomplished, multidisciplinary mentoring team with specific, project-relevant expertise which includes 4 practicing clinician-scientists. This includes a primary mentor (Carrie McDonald) who is an expert in post-surgical clinical outcomes in TLE, a co- mentor (Daniel Drane) who has helped pioneer innovations in surgical approaches to preserve cognitive function, and a co-mentor (Nigel Pedersen) who uses neurostimulation approaches as both a clinical neurologist and a researcher. My consultants include UCSD's epilepsy neurosurgeon (Sharona Ben-Haim), an electrical engineer (Shadi Dayeh), and a neurophysiologist (Eric Halgren) who are experts in applying innovative electrophysiological techniques in a surgical context. Additionally, I will receive statistical support from the local biostatistics unit at the Clinical and Translational Research Institute at the University of California San Diego (Xin Tu). The proposed research study, comprehensive training plan, strong mentorship team, and robust infrastructure will place Dr. Kaestner in a unique position to conduct translational neurostimulation research to improve cognitive outcomes and quality of life for patients."
10755285,"Project Summary/Abstract
Eukaryotic cells must maintain a specific protein and lipid composition of the plasma membrane and all of the
internal membrane-bound organelles in order to function normally. Even though membrane biogenesis is
crucial for life, mechanisms for establishing the composition and organization of membranes remain poorly
understood. We study how membrane asymmetry is established, a fundamental feature of the eukaryotic cell
plasma membrane defined by the enrichment of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine within the
cytosolic leaflet, while sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholine are typically enriched in the extracellular leaflet of
the bilayer. Regulated exposure of PS and PE on the extracellular leaflet contributes to cell signaling,
cytokinesis, blood clotting, cell-cell fusion, apoptotic cell corpse removal and host-viral interactions. Membrane
asymmetry is driven by type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases), which are a large family of flippases that pump
lipids from the extracellular leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane bilayer. The P4-ATPase subfamily is
highly conserved among eukaryotes and these transporters have been implicated in pathological conditions
such as obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, hearing loss, immune deficiency,
and severe neurological disease. In addition, P4-ATPases are critical components of the vesicle-mediated
protein trafficking machinery within the Golgi complex and endosomal system. Through their role in protein
trafficking, P4-ATPases help control the precise protein composition of the plasma membrane, Golgi complex
endosomes and lysosomes. The proposed studies will determine how the P4-ATPases recognize and
transport their lipid substrates to establish membrane asymmetry using structural, biochemical and molecular
genetic approaches. These structure/function studies will include how P4-ATPase activity is regulated by post-
translational modification and protein-protein interactions. We will also probe the cellular requirements for
transport of specific substrate lipids, like glucosylceramide and phosphatidylserine, on cell morphogenesis,
fungal pathogenesis, nutrient signaling, and protein trafficking. For the latter studies, we will probe how P4-
ATPases help drive vesicle-mediated protein transport with a focus on carriers formed by COPI and retromer.
Atypical roles for ubiquitination in the P4-ATPase- and COPI-dependent transport pathways will also be
defined. In total, these studies should lead to a much better understanding of how P4-ATPases exert their
essential function, and will be invaluable to our ability to understand and ultimately treat pathologies associated
with P4-ATPase deficiency."
10755288,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal includes a five-year research career development program to study classical and alternative
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). The
candidate is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy. The proposal
builds on the candidate’s strong background in clinical research on AKI and integrates mentorship from
established investigators in sepsis, AKI, RAS therapeutics, and murine models of SA-AKI. The proposed
career development activities will equip the candidate with the skills necessary to become established as an
independent clinical and translational scientist conducting patient-oriented research on SA-AKI. Over 4 million
patients are hospitalized annually with AKI, and sepsis is estimated to contribute to 26-50% of all cases.
Current therapy is limited to supportive care and kidney replacement therapy. Recent evidence suggests
sepsis causes a disruption in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 that could severely dysregulate
the RAS. This disruption may ultimately result in local excess of the proinflammatory, classical RAS and
deficiencies in the counter-regulatory, anti-inflammatory alternative RAS (Alt-RAS). An intra-renal RAS,
operating independently from the circulatory RAS, may drive pathophysiology and urinary RAS biomarkers
have been proposed as surrogate markers of intra-renal RAS activation. Using a bedside-to-bench approach,
our overall objective is to quantify the classical and Alt-RAS disturbances present at the circulatory and tissue
level in SA-AKI, and evaluate the relationship between the extent of this disturbance and major adverse kidney
events. Our central hypothesis is that a deficiency of the regenerative RAS, or Alt-RAS, exists relative to the
classical RAS in SA-AKI at the circulatory and tissue level, and that the degree of this imbalance differentially
associates with outcomes in patients with SA-AKI. We propose three specific aims to accomplish this: (1) To
determine the relationship between RAS dysregulation, kidney biomarkers of tubular injury and function, and
major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE-30) in SA-AKI, (2) To assess the relationship between
urinary biomarkers of intra-renal RAS activation and MAKE outcomes out to one year in critically ill patients
with SA-AKI and heterogenous AKI, and (3) To test the hypothesis that the kidney RAS peptide metabolome
and receptor expression profile shift to a regenerative or Alt-RAS deficiency in a murine model of SA-AKI, and
that the degree of Alt-RAS deficiency (relative to classical RAS) corresponds to the degree of kidney injury and
intra-renal RAS activation. Career development activities that align with this research include: training in
application of laboratory assays including mass spectrometry, advancement of statistical analysis skills with
longitudinal data and introductory machine learning, and learning pre-clinical models of SA-AKI. This proposal
supports the mission of NIDDK by furthering the understanding of SA- AKI, a leading cause of AKI and kidney
complications impacting the public’s health and quality of life."
10861045,"Changes in the strength of GABAergic transmission is heavily influenced by posttranslational modifications and allosteric modulators like benzodiazepines and neurosteroids. O-GlcNAcylation (O- GlcNAc) is a post- translational modification that is tightly regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which add or remove the O-GlcNAc moiety of β–N-acetylglucosamine to Ser/Thr residues on proteins, respectively. Various neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), and metabolic disorders like, diabetes exhibit dysregulated O-GlcNAc levels. Published reports from our lab have demonstrated that an acute increase in O-GlcNAcylation induces a long-term depression of evoked GABAAR mediated IPSCs (eIPSCs) and reduces the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous IPSC (sIPSC) in hippocampal principal cells, however the mechanism in which this occurs is unknown. Numerous studies have shown that serine phosphorylation of GABAAR can increase or decrease GABAAR currents depending on the neuron type and specific subunit. While O-GlcNAcylation modulates inhibitory GABA-gated currents, no studies have examined its interplay with serine phosphorylation on GABAergic transmission. Because the crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation affects the regulation of various proteins, the potential exists that O-OglcNAcylation and phosphorylation will interaction in the modulation of GABAAR function and the strength of inhibitory transmission. Furthermore, a potential interaction could impact how allosteric modulators effect GABAARs, since serine phosphorylation can either increase or decrease efficacy of these modulators. Studies proposed will investigate these hypotheses and will also test whether disease conditions where O- GlcNAc levels are chronically elevated lead to depressed GABAAR function that can be rescued via pharmacological inhibition of OGT. To determine O-GlcNAcylation's effect on GABAergic transmission in the presence of phosphorylation and allosteric modulators, I will use electrophysiological techniques, immunoblotting assays and mass spectrometry. Results will show whether the modulation of GABAAR function by PKA and allosteric modulators are shaped by the presence or absence of a co-occurring O- GlcNAc modification and if the restoration of O-GlcNAcylation levels in a disease models can restore the E/I balance."

Since 2014, the Pediatric Research in Sports Medicine (PRiSM) Society Conference has occurred annually and
is a leading forum for the presentation and discussion of new, innovative, and cutting-edge collaborative research
and information dissemination in the field of pediatric sports medicine. As the only conference focused on
advancing knowledge on pediatric sports medicine with an interdisciplinary focus, our objective is to advance
our biological understanding of injuries and pathologies specific to pediatric athletes, and to enhance health for
this unique population of individuals. The conference format provides space and time built in for interdisciplinary
research collaboration discussions, learning from top experts in the field, and sharing the most recent findings
from individuals via podium and poster presentations. Furthermore, this conference has not only led to
discussions around the latest research advancements among individual research teams across the country, but
to collaborative publications by PRiSM members from different training disciplines and from different geographic
locations on topics such as Sports Specialization, Patient-Reported Outcomes, or Tibial Spine Fracture
Management. Furthermore, our emphasis on diversity since the inception of PRiSM has led to a robust program
that features clinicians and researchers from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, all aimed toward
understanding how we can improve care for pediatric athletes. We are requesting funds for the PRiSM Society
Annual Conference, to be held in Houston, TX in 2022. Through this award, we will be able to provide student
travel grant opportunities to allow individuals to attend who otherwise would not have been able. Furthermore,
this will allow us to conduct our conference in a hybrid format of live, in-person attendance as well as the
capability to broadcast online so we can facilitate a robust discussion between those who are able to attend while
increasing accessibility to a broad array of professionals and trainees interested in pediatric sports medicine
research who cannot attend in person. Each 3-day annual meeting consists of 10 parallel scientific sessions, 3
keynote lectures, 2 sessions for research interest group members to discuss collaborative research projects, 3
poster sessions, and 2 parallel instructional course sessions geared toward integrating innovative evidence into
practice. Our demonstrated ability to provide a forum that advances knowledge while creating an environment
of inclusivity and accessibility indicates our potential to successfully achieve our aims through this proposal: 1)
To generate scientific content and programming highlighting the latest research and advancements in care within
the pediatric sports medicine community, and 2) to foster an environment of research collaboration among a
diverse set of professionals and trainees involved in pediatric sports medicine research."

Health disparities start early in life, with Black infants (10.6 per 1,000) twice as likely to die compared to White
infants (4.5 per 1,000). Adverse pregnancy outcomes are responsible for the majority of the Black-White infant
mortality disparity. Extensive healthcare efforts have been taken to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes and
to optimize child growth, health, and neurodevelopment. However, birth and childhood outcomes remain major
areas of public health concern with ongoing inequities. Macroenvironmental health promoting factors
(greenspace, walkability) and health threatening factors (pollution, neighborhood violence, extreme
temperatures) may affect health directly through inflammatory and immunologic pathways. Macroenvironments
may also contribute to lived experiences of income potential and educational attainment. Combined with
interpersonal individual exposures such as racism and violence, macroenvironments may alter individuals'
microenvironmental health factors such as diet, physical activity, psychosocial stress, and sleep. While macro-
and microenvironmental exposures have been studied individually, the impact of neighborhood environments
on complex health disorders in pregnancy and early childhood remains understudied and the interplay with
microenvironmental factors to reduce disparities is completely unknown. We propose a causal inference
framework to evaluate the role of specific macroenvironment factors (Aim 1) to reduce the risks of abnormal
fetal growth, preterm birth, obesity, asthma, and neurodevelopmental delays by age 3, as well as whether such
factors may improve racial disparities in these outcomes. We will also identify optimal components of
microenvironmental factors of diet, physical activity, and sleep, during pregnancy (Aim 2) and among couples
during preconception (Aim 4), that can best be utilized to maximize reductions in health disparities. We have
assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia who are well-positioned to complete the study and recruit up to 2500 pregnant people, partners,
and offspring, with retention of at least 75% at age 3, among whom 1250 will be recruited into the
preconception pilot (Aim 3). The health system at Penn/CHOP serves a population underrepresented in other
pregnancy and pediatric cohorts in the US (largely Medicaid-insured and plurality Black). The culture of clinical
research, excellent scientific environment, and diverse population makes Penn and CHOP the ideal place to
innovate in the field of maternal-child health equity. The Penn-CHOP ECHO study team is committed to the
success of this work and looks forward to working collaboratively with the other ECHO Study Sites,
Coordinating Centers, and Cores."
10870146,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes form in innate immune cells to trigger inflammation upon
detection of pathogens or tissue damage. Abnormal inflammasome activation leads to chronic inflammation,
which is the culprit of numerous life-threatening diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders,
and the cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inflammasome assembly is controlled by protein-protein
interactions as it requires the self-association and oligomerization of multiple copies of three proteins: sensors
to detect danger signals, a protease to activate inflammatory factors, and the adaptor protein ASC to connect
sensor and protease. Inflammasome formation leads to plasma membrane rupture and concomitant cell death,
thus resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammasome particles to the extracellular
environment. These extracellular inflammasomes are internalized by nearby cells to perpetuate and amplify the
inflammatory response. Removing or sequestering extracellular inflammasomes will likely inhibit or reduce
inflammation. Therefore, extracellular inflammasomes are potential therapeutic targets. Our laboratory’s
extensive experience on the function and structure of the adaptor ASC, and its interactions with other
inflammasome proteins, has led us to create hydrogels designed to form specific protein-protein interactions with
inflammasomes; thus, they have the potential to broadly inhibit inflammation by effectively capturing and
removing extracellular inflammasomes. This project focuses on identifying the hydrogelation factors leading to
optimum biding of inflammasome particles in cell-free systems (Aim 1); and determining the anti-inflammatory
efficiency of the hydrogels in the presence of activated innate immune cells (Aim 2). Our experimental plan will
combine cell biology and biochemical approaches, including live/dead cell imaging, flow cytometry,
immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and fluorescence spectroscopy. Overall, we expect to
develop a hydrogel technology of broad applicability to reduce inflammation in the absence of drug loading by
targeting the inflammasome, which is implicated in many inflammatory diseases."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of the Maternal American Indian Rural Community Health Research Center of Excellence (M.A.R.C.H.) is
to provide a platform for researchers, tribal nations, rural communities and key stakeholders to engage in bidirectional
communications on maternal health, in particular drivers of mortality and severe morbidity. All center components
revolve around two populations with stark health disparities in our region – American Indian and rural residents.
Novel mechanisms for improving access to care and creating a better understanding of barriers to and facilitators of
accessing care feed into the overarching theme of the center and the projects proposed. The key elements of
M.A.R.C.H. include 1) multi-layered and novel projects that have emerged from long-standing community relationships
with the goal of addressing preventable maternal mortality, decreasing severe maternal morbidity, and promoting
maternal health equity; 2) a community engagement core that will serve as a central hub to connect M.A.R.C.H.
activities with the vast network of partners; and 3) a training core which will support project-specific training needs, as
well as an overall structure of training focused on cultural competency and health research literacy."
10908685,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: HOME
Racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes, including heightened morbidity and mortality for mothers
and their infants, persist and are not fully explained by individual risk factors. Black birthing people in
the US are three times more likely to be affected than their white counterparts, and in Wisconsin, the
risk is five times greater. Due to Milwaukee, Wisconsin being one of the five most segregated cities in
the US, Black birthing families are also more likely to be low-income than their white counterparts and
experience housing instability. Housing instability is a crucial social determinant of health that affects
birthing people and their children, perpetuating poverty and poor health in future generations. There is
an important gap in knowledge of the effect of housing instability on maternal health, that we seek to
address in this proposal. The “Reducing HOusing instability and neighborhood deprivation for
Maternal hEalth” (HOME) proposal’s central hypothesis is that investigating the effects of different
housing statuses and stability on maternal physical and mental health will lead to more profound
understanding of the impact of housing instability on pregnancy outcomes and motivate policy change
to reduce maternal health disparities. In Aim 1, we will understand how personal and neighborhood
characteristics and services contribute to housing stability among low-income pregnant people to
inform programs to improve stability. In Aim 2, we will explore the impact of housing
instability/homelessness and neighborhood conditions on allostatic load, physical and mental health,
and pregnancy outcomes. In Aim 3, we will identify the service needs of pregnant people in each
housing status, and advocate for policy-level change to address housing instability among birthing
people. The proposed study will tease out the contribution of these factors and characteristics and
correlate them to maternal health outcomes. This work could inform screening tools to assess
pregnancy risk, inform policy change, and elucidate biological mechanisms by which structural factors
result in health disparities."
10908689,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: BUNDLE
Black/African American (Black/AA) birthing people experience disproportionately higher rates of mortality and
morbidity associated with pregnancy. Nationwide, Black women are three times more likely to die from
pregnancy-related causes than non-Hispanic white women, but in Wisconsin, they are five times more likely to
die. 70% of the Black population of Wisconsin resides in Milwaukee County, which is in Southeastern
Wisconsin. One of the key factors contributing to these disparities is medical mistrust, a defensive reaction
against prevailing structural inequities that leads to suboptimal access to healthcare resources. In our
healthcare system, we found high rates of medical mistrust among Black/AA pregnant people. Moreover, a
2021 Community Health Needs Assessment conducted in Milwaukee County, relying on residents’ survey,
stakeholders’ interviews and focus groups with community leaders, found that trust in the health care system
was identified as key concern for maternal and infant health in Milwaukee County. To address the critical need
to build trust between our healthcare system and Black/AA birthing communities in Southeastern Wisconsin,
our team has partnered with a community-based doula organization, the African American Breastfeeding
Network (AABN). Community-based doulas are integral in addressing the maternal health crisis by diversifying
the prenatal workforce and serving as advocates and emotional supporters for mothers as they navigate the
health system. Numerous studies demonstrate that community-based doulas are associated with lower odds of
cesarean, preterm birth, and postpartum depression. However, currently, AABN doulas and any other
community-based doulas operate separately from healthcare professionals in Wisconsin. This leads to mixed
attitudes on acceptance of doulas on labor and delivery by hospital staff. To date, no effort has been attempted
to merge the strengths of these groups to improve maternal health across the region. Our central hypothesis is
that earlier integration of community-based doulas in prenatal care reduces medical mistrust by uniting and
diversifying the perinatal workforce and improves maternal health outcomes. We plan to test this hypothesis
with a mixed methods study, titled Building TrUst and UNiting Teams Through DouLa partnErship (BUNDLE),
using three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop an integrated prenatal care model of medical providers and
community-based doulas in Southeastern Wisconsin, Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of the integrated
prenatal care model to standard prenatal care in improving healthcare engagement and trust, and reducing
adverse outcomes, and Aim 3: Disseminate findings to scholarly and community-based forums and actively
pursue opportunities for systems- and policy-level change. After the proposed research is completed, we
expect to identify drivers of medical mistrust for Black birthing people and the establish a sustainable
integrated doula-clinician model that builds trust through a diversified and united perinatal workforce, improves
healthcare engagement, and reduces severe maternal morbidity."
10908694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: TEAM COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP COMPONENT
The U.S. spends more on maternity care than any other country, and yet maternal death rates have risen since
2000, and the risk of death from pregnancy-related complications is higher than in any other high-income
country. Black/African American individuals and individuals with lower socioeconomic status disproportionately
bear the burden of these outcomes. Multi-sector, multifactorial solutions are needed to address the root causes
of these disparities, and advance solutions to create equity in maternal health. In our Maternal Health
Research Center of Excellence, we will bring together clinical health professionals, community leaders,
researchers, community-based doulas, policymakers, and individuals who provide housing and resources for
high-risk pregnancies. Our efforts will provide access to housing, build trust, and improve postpartum care, all
grounded in rigorous evaluation that will inform advocacy for sustainable systems- and policy-level change.
Coordinating all of these efforts will require transdisciplinary collaborations to integrate individual disciplines
and address these complex issues. Our Trandisciplinary and Equitable Approach to Maternal health (TEAM)
Community Partnership Component, adapted from a successful Community and Cancer Science Network
Framework, will include perspectives that go beyond the boundaries of disciplinary knowledge and co-develop
solutions that address the root causes of maternal health disparities. Our central hypothesis is that approaches
grounded in deep equity that integrate diverse perspectives will help addressing social-structural contributors
to racial disparities in maternal health outcomes. We will pursue this hypothesis with three specific aims: 1)
Create a TEAM that includes experts from research, clinical, population health, and community settings to
generate a conceptual model of maternal health disparities in Southeastern Wisconsin, 2) Facilitate
engagement across all project components to ensure equitable, trusting relationships between all members of
the Maternal Health Center of Excellence, and 3) Disseminate results of partnership in government,
community, clinical, and academic settings. Short-term, this innovative approach will build bidirectional,
sustained partnerships between diverse groups of individuals dedicated to improving maternal health. Medium-
term, the innovative approaches in our grant will improve maternal health outcomes for our study participants
and inform policies to impact disparities locally and nationwide. Long-term, this equitable approach to
healthcare partnerships promises to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disease,
eradicating multiple disparities through an integrated healthcare continuum that spans from birth to pregnancy
and beyond."

10914661,"Abstract:
Craniofacial differences are among the most common congenital disorders in humans. There are many
regulatory factors at play during development of the head and face, with much left to understand. The
dysfunction of the ciliogenesis and planar polarity effectors (CPLANE) are a known cause of human
Orofaciodigital Disorders (OFD). The Rsg1 subunit of CPLANE is essential for ciliary function, but it remains
among the least-studied components, and its mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. Importantly,
my preliminary data suggest that Rsg1 interacts with Fam92, Chibby, and Dzip1, proteins required for basal
body docking and transition zone assembly.
In this proposed research, the craniofacial developmental differences after disruption of Rsg1 and Fam92 will
be explored in a model animal, with a specific focus on neural crest development. In vivo live imaging of
ciliated cells will be studied to determine the cellular function of these proteins. Lastly, the biochemical function
of the Fam92 BAR domains and disordered regions for membrane morphology will be explored in in vitro
systems. Thus, the whole embryo, cellular, and biochemical functions of ciliary proteins Rsg1 and the Fam92-
Chibby-Dzip1 module will be elucidated by the proposed work, which in turn will advance our understanding of
congenital craniofacial disorders."

Mutations in key factors of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), including Upf2, Upf3a, Upf3b, and Smg6,
are enriched in various neurodevelopmental diseases. In additional to ensuring transcript quality by degrading
aberrant transcripts with a premature stop codon, NMD modulates stability of selective mRNAs to fine-tune
transcript abundance. Whether and how NMD influences brain development remains elusive. Our long-term
objective is to understand the functional role of NMD regulation for the complicated and dynamic process of
neurogenesis and how its mis-regulation leads to neurodevelopmental disorders. We determine the
requirement of NMD for neural development through selective genetic ablation of Upf2 and in vivo
manipulation of other NMD factors. Our preliminary data show that deletion of UPF2 in neural stem and
progenitors results in microcephaly. UPF2 loss specifically affects the cell cycle and lineage progression of
radial glia cells (RGCs), the major neural progenitor cells in the developing neocortex. We will combine cutting
edge molecular cellular ribogenomics approaches, mouse genetics, and developmental neurobiology to dissect
the mechanisms of NMD regulating neurogenesis. We propose three independent and interrelated aims to
investigate possible variables underlying the microcephaly phenotype. In Aim 1, we will determine the cell
cycle behaviors of RGCs in NMD knockout mice qualitatively and quantitatively and unveil the underlying
regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will determine the lineage progression of RGCs and the resulting
neuronal outputs per time unit in NMD knockout mice. By characterizing these molecular cellular defects, we
also aim to provide mechanistic insights to transcriptomic regulation of RGC’s lineage transitions. NMD may
regulate cell fates either independent of cell cycle controls or as the consequence of affecting the cell cycle. In
Aim 3, we will test these two hypotheses and leverage our results to reexamine the relationship between cell
cycle and cell fate. Successful completion of these studies will provide fundamental insights into how selective
mRNA stability underlies the highly regulated cortical neurogenesis process in the mammalian brain. The
proposed studies will also shed light on some fundamental questions about the control of cell cycle, cell fate,
and their relationship during neural development."

10757750,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain cancer that is resistant to all treatment modalities. This
resistance is due, in large part, to a population of high invasive and low proliferative cancer cells
that elude surgical resection and are refractory to chemotherapy and radiation. While a great
deal is known about oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and other pathways that promote GBM cell
proliferation, we understand relatively little about mechanisms that drive GBM cell invasion in
the brain microenvironment. Therefore, the PI's group performed genetic and biochemical
screens to identify adhesion and signaling factors that regulate invasive cell growth in GBM.
These efforts identified the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST/PTPN12 as a
critical signaling effector in invasive GBM cells. Here, we present a significant amount of
supporting data showing that PTP-PEST promotes GBM cell invasion by regulating the stability
of key focal adhesion signaling proteins, particularly Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas). In
particular, we have discovered that PTP-PEST in focal adhesions mediates interactions
between p130Cas and valosin containing protein (Vcp), a ubiquitin-dependent segregase and
key component of the ubiquitin proteasome system. These findings have led to our working
hypothesis that PTP-PEST is essential for GBM cell invasion by regulating the phosphorylation-
dependent ubiquitination of focal adhesion protein substrates. To test this hypothesis, we will (1)
characterize protein domains and motifs that mediate interactions between PTP-PEST,
p130Cas, and Vcp, as well as determine how these interactions modulate focal adhesion
protein stability in GBM cells; (2) identify PTP-PEST-generated phosphodegron sequences in
p130Cas and determine how they regulate focal adhesion dynamics by recruiting Vcp and
facilitating p130Cas degradation by the proteasome; (3) genetically mutate Vcp at specific sites
required for the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of p130Cas and analyze cell invasion
using three-dimensional culture systems and pre-clinical mouse models of GBM; and (4)
quantify levels and spatial patterns of PTP-PEST signaling via p130Cas and Vcp in human
GBM samples and primary cancer cell culture systems. We will correlate these data with patient
survival as well as response to therapies such as temozolomide and bevacizumab. Collectively,
these experiments will not only elucidate signaling pathways that control the GBM cell invasive
state, but may lead to new strategies to target invasive cells and block tumor progression."
10758221,"With just ten major proteins, influenza A virus (IAV) must gain entry to both cell and nucleus, transcribe and replicate its genome, and then perform the inverse of the entry process in order to egress and spread. To achieve this, the virus must introduce new components that change viral biology as the infection progresses. We believe one major component that orchestrates these changes derives from small virus-encoded RNAs (svRNAs) that engage and modulate the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This grant focuses on defining how svRNAs change the function of the viral RdRp during the course of infection. The knowledge gained from these studies will significantly contribute to our understanding of IAV biology and may provide an entirely new direction towards the future development of novel therapeutics."

The present study focuses on our discovery that developmentally silenced SIX-family transcription
factors are reactivated by TNF-family cytokines and potently suppress gene expression programs
induced by non-canonical NF-kB. By first characterizing the human cytokines and pathogen
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that induce Six1 and Six2 protein expression and by then
investigating the molecular components required for their reactivation (Aim 1), these studies will
reveal a new pathway for non-canonical NF-kB regulation in the mammalian immune system. Second,
we will determine how Six-proteins inhibit inflammatory gene expression programs through promoter
proximal mechanisms (Aim 2). Physiological significance of inflammatory resolution by Six-proteins
while be investigated in mammalian model organisms using three complementary mouse models of
Six1 protein function (Aim 3). Insights gleaned from these studies will explain how non-canonical NF-
kB is regulated at gene promoters and will also reveal co-repressor complexes that play important
roles in the inflammatory response to microbial pathogens. Developing new drugs that interfere with
the ability of SIX proteins to regulate non-canonical NF-kB during microbial infection would be an
innovative approach to combat human disease associated with NF-kB signaling dysfunction including
chronic inflammation. Therefore, by revealing molecular details of SIX-protein function in the
mammalian immune system, from biochemistry to mouse models of infection, we will uncover sites of
potential weakness that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention. Importantly, these studies will
also provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of an important infectious disease-causing
agent and also into the biology of the human inflammatory response."

this data in real-time, and updating the instrument with new parameters to maximize protein characterization.
In this project, new processes for detecting and identifying mass features will be implemented. Strategies will
also be designed to direct the instrument in collecting high-quality fragmentation data with data-driven updates
to fragmentation settings. Strategies will also be specially developed for biologics and other large molecules.
Lastly, data will be presented to users via interactive visuals intended to simplify and ease data interpretation.
Collectively, the new software platform will provide great improvements to how top-down mass spectrometry

10932200,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Myriel, Inc., is a pharmaceutical start-up company founded in 2022 to find cures for tauopathies, including
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), which impair cognition in 32% of US adults 65 years and
older. The goal of this Phase 1 STTR application is to provide Myriel with a brain-penetrant analogue of our lead
compound, GPHR ‘739, the first potent, selective, reversible Casp2 inhibitor that successfully reverses
pathologically depressed neurotransmission in a rodent model of ADRD. Inhibiting Casp2 is a highly promising
strategy for treating ADRD because Casp2-cleavage of the neuronal protein tau compromises synaptic and
cognitive function in models of several different ADRD, and preventing Casp2 from cleaving tau in this manner
restores synaptic function and reverses preexisting memory loss. Our central hypothesis is that prodrugs of
GPHR ‘739 in which its two negatively charged carboxylic acids are neutralized by esterification, cyclization,
and/or amidation to meet predetermined attributes for metabolic stability and membrane penetration will cross
the blood-brain-barrier, thereby qualifying them for future pharmacodynamic studies. Myriel will capitalize on the
co-PI’s (Walters) experience discovering brain-penetrant compounds and prodrugs that successfully completed
IND-enabling studies and reached clinical trials, and skillfully adapt strategies that produced a brain-penetrant
Casp2/3 inhibitor which improves ischemic brain injury in rats and a brain-penetrant Casp1 inhibitor that
advanced to Phase 2 clinical trials. We will achieve our goal of generating a brain-penetrant Casp2 inhibitor
through three specific aims: 1) esterification and amidation of diacid side-chains in GPHR ‘739; 2) cyclization of
diacid side-chains in GPHR ‘739; and 3) pharmacokinetic studies of five GPHR ‘739 analogues. Upon completion
of this project, we expect to have at least one prodrug of GPHR ‘739 that penetrates into the brain to prespecified
levels, thus poising it for future IND-enabling studies. These results will significantly advance Myriel’s progress
toward developing a Casp2-inhibiting drug that reduces the prevalence of impaired cognition in the elderly."
10763401,"The organizational context in which nursing care is delivered plays a key role in health outcomes for patients.
Through our NINR-sponsored program of research, continually funded since inception, we have produced vital
information from large and representative samples of organizations (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, primary
care practices) on the impact of the context of nursing care on patient outcomes, health disparities, and nurse
well-being. The modifiable features of interest include ensuring sufficient nurse staffing and resources,
investing in nurse education, trusting nurses' autonomy to make informed clinical decisions and act, fostering
interprofessional teamwork and respect, and involving frontline nurses in policy and decision-making. We
conducted large-scale surveys of nurses in 1999, 2006, 2016, 2020, and 2021, aggregating their responses to
produce organization-level nursing measures, as well as indicators of nurse outcomes (e.g., burnout) that we
link with clinical outcomes data from patients in the same organizations. The majority of the work was cross-
sectional, and while suggestive, falls short of providing the confidence needed to translate evidence into major
policy and practice reforms. Our last renewal application enlarged the measurement and analytic frame to
longitudinal analyses of organizational changes and outcomes at two points in time in 4 states. In this renewal,
we will significantly extend and expand this work to enable replication of our data collection effort twice within
the study period in 7 states (CA, FL, IL, NJ, NM, NY, PA), creating a unique panel dataset of organizations, the
nurses working there, and the patients they care for, going as far back as 1999. We leverage a new
partnership to substantially reduce the cost of data collection and add states that allow for new questions about
the differential impact of nursing changes for various populations. The design emphasizes evaluation of factors
inducing change in nursing practice, distinguishing the impact of the active and intentional, e.g., Magnet
recognition, policies like staffing ratios, from the environmental and historical, e.g., COVID-19 pandemic,
hospital consolidation trends, on outcomes for patients of all ages, risk factors, and demographics. Our aims
are: 1) to determine whether there are sustainable effects of organizational change on nursing practice and
associated patient outcomes and cost across a range of patient populations and settings; 2) to determine
whether organizational nursing changes over time diminish health disparities and if the changes and their
effects differ in minority-serving and/or safety-net organizations; and 3) to examine if nursing-related policy
interventions (e.g., nurse-to-patient ratios [CA], staffing committees [NY]) and organizational innovations (e.g.,
Magnet/Pathway) aimed at improving outcomes through work environment reform had a sustained impact over
time and in the face of challenges like COVID-19. The overarching aim is to not just understand the benefits of
organizational change for patient outcomes, but to understand how to target organizational change via
intervention that can have a transformative impact on health equity, nurse wellbeing, and patient outcomes."

To understand the role of maternal diet in developmentally programmed heart disease, we developed a rat model that compared outcomes of control, diabetes-, high-fat diet-, and combination-exposed offspring. We found that, just like in humans, fetal overnutrition in rats causes cardiac dysfunction at birth and again in adulthood. We also demonstrated that cardiac consequences are due to mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired cardiomyocyte metabolism, and faster cell death following metabolic stress. Importantly, we found that a maternal high-fat diet exaggerates mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction to increase mortality in offspring born to diabetic mothers (ODM), specifically by increasing fetal overnutrition and programming the cardiac transcriptome to be more susceptible to oxidative damage. While our work highlights the role of maternal dietary fat intake, key questions about programming remain: 1. Does oxidative DNA damage contribute to programmed heart disease in ODM and the next generation? 2. Will limiting fat intake during the last trimester of pregnancy mitigate risks? 3. Can the dietary antioxidant Coenzyme Q (CoQ10) prevent programmed heart disease in ODM and their progeny? Aim 1 will use innovative genomic approaches paired with cardiac phenotyping across generations to establish whether oxidative DNA damage contributes to programmed heart disease following fetal overnutrition. As primary producers of ROS, dysfunctional mitochondria can cause oxidative DNA damage in the form of 8-oxo- 7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a mutagenic lesion prone to misrepair and genome instability. Genomic perturbations from 8-oxodG have been linked to metabolic disease, early ageing, and inflammation; moreover, they may be inheritable. We will determine whether 8-oxodG contributes to programmed heart disease in our model by comparing whole genome levels and downstream genomic perturbations using oxiDIP-seq. We will also use scRNA-sequencing of blastocysts from F0 females and their F1 and F2 offspring to delineate the timing of newly acquired mutations and whether there is compounding or dilution from DNA repair mechanisms across generations. Aims 2 and 3 will determine whether dietary interventions including limiting dietary fat intake in the last third of pregnancy or supplementing high-risk females with dietary CoQ10 during ovulation and fertilization will decrease the risk of developmentally programmed heart disease in ODM and their progeny. Findings are needed to understand mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and the effects of clinically applicable interventions such as expanding diabetic screening and dietary counseling to include management of maternal hyperlipidemia as well as hyperglycemia or offering preventative dietary supplementation during family planning."
10747353,"Abstract .
The second messenger 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is essential for regulating vascular
smooth muscle (VSM) function, including reactivity. The dogma that cAMP signaling in VSM only mediates
relaxation was recently challenged by our observation that glucose induces a subtle cAMP synthesis that
promotes contraction. These results suggest that cAMP versatility to regulate VSM reactivity to diverse stimuli
depends on their spatially confined properties within the cell, of which little is known. Moreover, no studies have
examined how cAMP pools are modulated by biological sex and its functional implications in VSM in health and
disease. Studies here will therefore address these key knowledge gaps. By leveraging the use of a sophisticated
toolkit in human and mouse VSM, exciting preliminary data is generated in support of the central hypothesis that
the production of discrete cAMP pools is essential for integrating receptor-dependent cAMP signaling to control
VSM reactivity in health and disease, and this is dependent on biological sex. This hypothesis will be tested in
three specific aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that Gs protein-coupled receptors (GsPCRs) induce sex-
specific discrete cAMP pools in VSM. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that GsPCRs cellular segregation triggers
distinct sex-specific discrete cAMP pools in VSM. Finally, Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that discrete cAMP
pools in VSM are disrupted in diabetes and hypertension (HTN). The proposal has high basic, translational and
clinical significance as it will reveal 1) new insight into discrete cAMP pools in VSM, 2) their influence by biological
sex in health and disease, and 3) opportunities to identify novel targets and develop new therapeutic strategies."
10762812,"The liminal zone between host epithelium and gut microbiota is rich in sulfide conversations that
are modulated by diet; their short- and long-range impacts on systemic H2S homeostasis
represent a largely unexplored terrain ripe for discovery. The toxicity of H2S, first described as a
noxious “acidic vapor” some 500 years ago, results from its inhibition of complex IV in the electron
transport chain (ETC) and explains the ubiquitous presence of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase
(SQOR) in mitochondria along with other sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes, for H2S disposal.
The past cycle witnessed exciting advances, including the discovery of an unorthodox redox
cofactor configuration, comprising an active site trisulfide, which affords the SQOR reaction an
~105-fold catalytic advantage, and characterization of the first clinical mutations in SQOR, which
present with brain pathology typical of Leigh disease. We discovered that plasticity embedded in
the mammalian ETC, which allows diversion of electrons to fumarate as a terminal acceptor when
the capacity to use O2 is restricted by H2S. The ensuing reductive shift in the ETC, propagates
beyond the mitochondrion via metabolic shuttles and redox cofactor pools, enhancing aerobic
glycolysis, lipid biogenesis and reductive carboxylation in the Krebs cycle. In the next cycle, we
will build on this exciting momentum as well as a wealth of preliminary data, introducing multi-
omics approaches (metabolomics, RNA-Seq and CRISPRi) combined with cellular and genetic
models of inducible SQOR deficiency (whole body or intestinal epithelium) to the rigorous
biochemical foundations of our program. We will characterize the allosteric regulation of H2S
biogenesis and clearance by metabolites identified from an unbiased screen, quantify the
potential of H2S to tune O2 affinity of complex IV, and assess its impact on the hypoxic response.
We will focus on the host-gut microbe interface, which we estimate accounts for ~70% of systemic
sulfide homeostasis, and evaluate how its modulation by dietary methionine, microbial
composition and host genotype influences brain pathology in control versus SQOR deficient mice.
Advanced microscopic techniques, including live-cell imaging with biosensors to monitor ATP
pools and redox shifts, will be used to elucidate H2S-induced changes to mitochondrial membrane
potential, morphology and fusion. And we will uncover the molecular basis of the correlation
between a graded decrease in gut reuterin (derived from Lactobacillus reuteri), and increasing
tumor burden in colorectal cancer and the associated increase in host sulfur metabolites. We will
continue to leverage the flexibility of the R35 funding mechanism for the sustained and innovative
interrogation of the impact of H2S chemical biology in health and disease."
10871835,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising renewable source of differentiated insulin-producing
islets for diabetes cell replacement therapy. Within the islets of diabetic patients, beta cells are dead or dys-
functional, causing loss of blood glucose control. There is no cure for diabetes, and current treatments are
insufficient in controlling the disease for many patients. Transplantation of insulin-secreting cells could be an
effective treatment for diabetes, and a small number of patients have been implanted with cadaveric donor
islets, remaining insulin independent for years. Unfortunately, many factors limit this approach, particularly the
scarcity and variability of isolated human islets, with patients often requiring islets from multiple donors to
achieve normal blood sugar. The lack of mature replacement tissues is a critical barrier to cellular therapy. We
have previously published a strategy for the scalable generation of hPSC-derived islets (SC-islets) in vitro that
are capable of secreting insulin and restoring normoglycemia in diabetic mice. However, a current challenge
with these in vitro-derived cells is the incomplete and uncontrolled differentiation to fully mature SC-islets that
are equal to primary cells. Our goal is to understand how modulating the microenvironment affects hPSC cell
fate decisions to and the subsequent maturation of SC-islets and to use this to innovate SC-islet generation
strategies for use in cellular therapy. To this end, we will study patterning of definitive endoderm and other
intermediate cell types produced by microenvironmental perturbation. Subsequent generation of the SC-islets
will be investigated, including characterizing in vitro and in vivo function and marker expression. The outcome
of this proposal will have a positive impact by filling gaps in our understanding of what controls SC-islet cell
fate specification to individual cell types, as well as how these cells mature. Successful completion of our
studies will inform strategies to improve SC-islet differentiation protocols for diabetes cell replacement therapy
and disease modeling."
10881950,"Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are believed to be major contributors to the viral reservoir that persists in
HIV-infected individuals, even when on antiretroviral therapy. We will explore the novel hypothesis that cytokines
IL-10 and TGF-b, which play important roles in lymph node biology and are upregulated post HIV infection, are
critically important for the formation of such a reservoir and represent potential targets for intervention.
Specifically, we hypothesize that IL-10/TGF-b promote the differentiation of HIV-susceptible Tfh cells, with
reduced antiviral defenses, that favor integration of intact proviruses into open chromatin gene targets
downstream of IL-10/TGF-b signaling pathways. We will examine multiple aspects of this model, including how
IL-10 and TGF-b suppress the intrinsic antiviral machinery in Tfh cells and how chromatin accessibility in genes
downstream of IL10/TGF-b signaling, promoted by STAT3/SMADs activation, allows infecting virions to integrate
preferentially in these open loci. As a result of these mechanisms, infected Tfh cells provide a reservoir of actively
transcribing intact proviruses, even under ART.
 In Aim 1, we will investigate these hypothesized roles of IL-10 and TGF-b in Tfh differentiation and HIV
integration/transcription using biobanked samples from lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals at different
stages post HIV infection (i.e. Fiebig IV/V, untreated chronic infection, and ART-treated). In Aim 2, we will
mechanistically validate our model, using tools such as CRISPR gene knockouts in ex vivo tonsil isolated CD4
T cells, to examine how the major pathways identified in Aim 1 contribute to the differentiation of Tfh cells, the
suppression of anti-viral machinery, and the promotion of integration of intact proviruses into active transcription
sites. Finally, in Aim 3, we will take advantage of lymph node specimens available from a cohort of rhesus
macaques that previously controlled SIV replication post-ART interruption (VL<1000 cps/mL), subsequent to in
vivo blockade of the IL-10 and PD-1 pathways. We will dissect mechanistically how this treatment led to SIV viral
DNA decay in their LNs.
 This proposal has several innovative aspects. Additionally to the available biobanked human and
macaque samples, we will use cutting-edge methods, including multiome, MIP-seq, multiplexed confocal imaging
with vDNA/RNA scope, and spatial transcriptomics. The project builds on our expertise with HIV pathogenesis,
Tfh biology, and the modulation of immune pathways through both in vitro models and in vivo interventions in
rhesus macaques. Additionally, we have the support of strong Co-Investigators with expertise in virology
(Vandekerckhove), tissue imaging (Petrovas), and data analysis, integration and interpretation (Kamaleswaran
and Sekaly). With such multidisciplinary approaches, synergies across the Aims, and a highly collaborative group
of established and early-stage investigators (proposing PI), we are confident that this project will lead to important
discoveries about immune regulation in the LN milieu and its impact on the HIV tissue reservoir."
10906022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People with HIV (PWH) are two to five times more likely to have experienced interpersonal trauma in their
lifetime than the general population1-3. Interpersonal trauma (childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse
[complex trauma], adult physical and sexual assault, and intimate partner violence [IPV/Adult Partner Abuse])
negatively impacts treatment adherence, retention in care, and viral suppression4-9 and HIV transmission4,39
African Americans (A.A.) bear a disproportionate burden of HIV and trauma2,10-12,39-40. HIV transmission rates
and health outcomes differ for men and women with HIV, a difference that may be associated with their
experience of trauma13-15. The impact of trauma for A.A. men and women on retention in HIV care, that is,
keeping routine medical appointments and durable viral suppression, is not well understood. Long-
term retention in HIV care is critical in preventing HIV disease progression, improving treatment adherence and
viral load suppression, increasing positive clinical health outcomes and reducing HIV transmission and
mortality4. Previous research showed that long-term retention in HIV care among A.A. living with HIV was only
46% at 36 months since the start of HIV care compared to 63% in the nonblack participants4. Results also
showed racial disparities in durable viral suppression among A.A. men and women with HIV 4,16 begin at 12
months since the start of HIV care and beyond, increasing the potential risk of HIV transmission 24,33. A.A.
account for 40% (479,300) of nearly 1.2 million PWH in the U.S., and 42% of nearly 36,801 new HIV diagnoses
in the U.S., while only representing 13% of the U.S. population39-40. A.A. women have the poorest clinical
health outcomes11,12 and greater experience of trauma than all races and ethnicities 10-12,17. HIV-positive men
experience lower rates of trauma than women with HIV; however, they experience more trauma than HIV-
negative men2. Thus far, most studies have used a cross-sectional design to examine relationships between
retention in HIV care, viral suppression4, and trauma experiences providing only a snapshot of a single
moment in time 12,18. Longitudinal studies are needed for a deeper understanding of the long-term clinical
implications of trauma in retention in HIV care and durable viral suppression among the A.A. PWH. The
purpose of this F31 fellowship, entitled MIRRORS (TRAUMA & HIV: RETENTION in HIV CARE and VIRAL
LOAD SUPPRESSION SAVES LIVES), is to conduct a secondary analysis testing the relative contribution of
each type of interpersonal trauma and life stages with experienced trauma (childhood, adulthood) on retention
in HIV care and durable viral suppression among A.A. men and women with HIV over 24 months. The
proposed study will utilize datasets from R01 MH092286 “Effects of Health Literacy on Health Disparities in
HIV Clinical Outcomes” (P.I.: Waldrop), a completed longitudinal study among 700 men and women
(n=424 Black/African American) with HIV; and use the parent project’s ancillary study, “Examining Retention in
Care and Health Literacy” (ENRICH) (F31- NR017580: PI. A. Anderson)."
10763805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a fundamentally new class of oligonucleotide agents – covalent
aptamers – that will have a major impact on nucleic acid-based reagents and therapeutics. Covalent aptamers
will be an enabling methodology behind new aptamer applications and will provide new solutions to persistent
limitations of this compound class. Aptamers are engineered oligonucleotides that bind protein targets and have
found applications in a multitude of areas, including therapeutics, diagnostics, drug delivery, and imaging. They
bind their targets with affinity and specificity that rivals those of antibodies, while displaying lower production
cost, higher production consistency, and the ability to easily introduce chemical modifications. Capitalizing on
the ability to amplify and sequence nucleic acids, aptamers are being generated through SELEX, a powerful in
vitro selection process. Our central hypothesis is that the formation of a covalent bond between an aptamer – or
a functional motif delivered by the aptamer – and its target protein will provide unprecedented residence time,
increase nuclease stability (or obviate the need for it), and facilitate aptamer selection. Furthermore, covalent
bond formation enables new applications based on the aptamer platform. The following aims will test this hy-
pothesis. Aim 1: The chemistry of covalent aptamers. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the design
principles behind covalent aptamers and to enable broad applicability, we will explore their chemistry based on
our promising preliminary results. We will explore applications in antibody drug conjugate assembly, as well as
catalytic covalent bond formation. Aim 2: Cell-based applications of covalent aptamers. We will develop several
applications that are enabled by covalent aptamers and that showcase their utility as chemical biology probes.
We are focusing on cell-surface proteins due to the rich collection of aptamers that have been reported. Aim 3:
Selection of covalent aptamers. For the de novo generation of covalent aptamers capable of selectively cross-
linking to any chosen protein target without prior sequence and/or structural information, we will develop a gen-
eralized in vitro selection process that adds distinct advantages to traditional SELEX."
10850807,"Project Summary/Abstract
Occurring more frequent than point mutations, the recombination events in HIV have resulted in
epidemiologically important founder strains in various geographic regions and contribute to at least 20-30% of
global HIV infections. However, after 33 years of recognizing HIV recombination, two critical questions still
remain elusive as to how HIV recombination events have occurred and how to predict emerging recombinant
clusters to better inform public health decision making. Based on nearly 20 years of HIV experience, we believe
that both questions relate to the flaws inherent in the current classification system for HIV recombinant families
(CRFs), which has inadequately appreciated the rapid virus evolution within and between recombinant families.
As a result, this static definition of CRFs not only creates a small-sample-size problem for most CRFs, but also
makes it difficult to track viral evolution in a dynamic means; while both issues are essential for public health
surveillance and for improved vaccine and antivirals design targeting HIV recombinants. In this proposed study,
our objectives are to: 1) strategically fulfill the inadequate and missing CRF information to overcome the small-
sample-size problem created by the CRF definition, and 2) provide a global profile along the HIV genome about
HIV’s recombination occurrence and evolution via pinpointing HIV predisposed recombination regions based on
the enriched CRF information. Our central hypothesis is that the inadequate and missing CRF information, which
accounts for the limited sample size for most CRFs and the lack of a dynamic view of CRFs, can be strategically
fulfilled by adding information from HIV fragment sequences (i.e., non-full-length sequences) that consist of over
90% of all published HIV data deposited in GenBank. Our hypothesis is based on several important lines of
evidence, including results from our studies. Our rationale for this proposed study is that fulfilling the inadequate
and missing CRF information will increase our capabilities in the surveillance and tracking of existing HIV
recombinants and for improved prediction of emerging HIV recombinants’ clusters. Leveraged by our nearly 20
years of experience in HIV data mining, statistical method development, statistical machine learning, and
statistical genetics, we will develop and validate two new methods in three Aims. By the end of this proposed
project, we expect to obtain new methods and new findings to advance our understanding of the CRFs (e.g.,
recombination mechanisms and evolution) and for improved public health surveillance for existing and emerging
CRF clusters. Finally, our methods and results will be released for free to facilitate other viruses’ research in
recombination."

The incidence of anal cancer has almost doubled during the past decades, along with increased advanced
disease and mortality. Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection leads to anal high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (aHSIL), the precursor for anal cancer. Anal cancer risk is also exceptionally
high among certain groups: people living with HIV, men having sex with men (MSM), and women with lower
high-grade anogenital tract diseases. Health disparity further contributes to this high rate, as minorities, such
as Black MSM, have a significantly higher rate of aHSIL and cancer. Thus, early detection of aHSIL,
particularly among high-risk minorities, is crucial to reduce cancer incidence and disease burden. However,
the current recommendation for aHSIL screening is based on expert opinions, and research on high-risk
minorities is scarce. Thereby, we propose this large multisite study to investigate potential screening markers
for aHSIL, with a specific focus on high-risk minorities. Furthermore, only a small portion of those diagnosed
with aHSIL will develop cancer, yet the treatment recommendation is for all aHSIL, resulting in significant over-
treatment, leading to unnecessary side effects and increased cost. It is crucial to develop reliable markers to
stratify risks of aHSIL progression and regression. Given the importance of local DNA methylation and the
immune environment to viral stimulus and carcinogenesis, hence, we will examine DNA methylation and
immunological profiles to identify markers for cancer risk stratification after aHSIL. Examining local immune
responses may also shed light on targeted immunotherapeutic approaches and for better outcomes.
Additionally, given the disparities in anal cancer incidence and outcomes and the increasingly recognized
impact of social determinants on health, including in HIV care, HPV infection, and cancer screening, we will
examine whether social determinants play a pivotal role in aHSIL prevalence and clearance. We will recruit
500 minority men and women at high risk for anal cancer from Emory University and the University of Miami,
where we have a large portion of diverse populations, including US born Blacks, Caribbean Blacks, Latinx, and
MSM. We will follow them yearly for up to two years. Overall, the proposed study provides a unique
opportunity to examine the much-needed evidence on early aHSIL screening among high-risk minorities. The
methylation results will be crucial to stratify risks of screen-detected aHSIL and could be translated to
screening. The immune and inflammatory profile will identify alterations associated with neoplastic progression
and subsequently inform targeted immune interventions for better outcomes. Documenting the importance of
social determinants will provide invaluable recommendations to reduce health disparities, improve screening
outcomes, and decrease the incidence of anal cancer among high-risk minorities."
10764101,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over the past four years, our U19 AG060917 has evolved from being multi–disciplinary to a
transdisciplinary program that has begun to enable team science encompassing aging epidemiology, bone
biology, adipose tissue biology and the neurosciences. Based at three primary sites in the U.S.––Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, and University of California at San
Francisco––the U19 receives collaborative input from Harvard Medical School, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
University of Leiden, Icelandic Heart Association, Columbia University, and, importantly, the National Institute
on Aging. The overall thrust that now integrates disciplines ranging from physical chemistry, biochemistry and
pharmacology, to complex mouse genetics, to case–cohort studies in people necessitates a mechanism that
will not only maintain connectivity between the groups over time, but also, more importantly, enable true
synergy. Thus, one function of the Administrative, Biostatistical and GLP Management Core (Core C) is to
provide overarching leadership, coordination and support across all sites. This has already been achieved
under the joint leadership of Drs. Zaidi and Rosen and will continue in earnest. For further seamlessness,
Core C has put in place a purposefully–crafted administrative structure for budget management, personnel
management, general scheduling and communication, and record maintenance. Dedicated biostatistical
support will ensure conformity of statistical procedures across multiple sites, and together with the MediaLab
Document Control System (Core A), will facilitate data re–analysis and cross–institutional validation. For
Projects that require analysis or re–analysis of RNA sequencing data, Core C will provide bioinformatics
support. Finally, we have recently expanded Core C to include the management of our new Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP) Platform. This platform has a separate GLP lab, is supported by an independent Quality
Assurance Program, and complies with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 58. The platform will
allow the proposed studies to be carried out under the strictest standards––which we consider not only a step
forward towards full transparency and rigor but is also key to the movement of our therapeutic FSH–blocking
antibody, MS-Hu6, into the clinic. In all, Core C, which is now matrixed within the Center for Translational
Medicine and Pharmacology of which Dr. Zaidi is Director, has become a vital overarching component of all
U19 Projects and both Cores."
10764102,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Our extended Skeletal, Metabolic and Neurobehavioral Core (Core A, SMNC) is a resource– and
expertise–based core that supports all Projects across the primary and collaborating sites. It represents a
transdisciplinary expansion of our current Core A—and now comprises a battery of six neurobehavioral
tests and two stereotactic brain injection platforms, in addition to state–of–the–art facilities for skeletal and
metabolic phenotyping. For the rodent–based Projects 1 through 3, we require the estimation of body fat, bone
marrow adipose tissue, energy expenditure, bone structure and function, neurobehavioral testing and/or
stereotactic injections, while all projects, including Project 4, need serum hormone assays. Thus, our
expanded Core A will provide dual–energy X–ray absorptiometry (OsteoSys), quantitative nuclear magnetic
resonance (qNMR, EchoMRI-100), metabolic cages (Promethion), ELISA platforms, and a full complement of
histology, immunohistochemistry and bone histomorphometry. At Maine Medical Center Research Institute
(MMCRI), Core A will provide osmium micro–computed tomography (µCT, VivaCT-40 for bone marrow
adipose tissue, and when required, qNMR (Bruker-7T) for body fat. Core A will also serve as a sample storage
and distribution center. For bone µCT and 4–point bending tests, Core A will send bone samples to Dr. Jay
Cao (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grand Forks, North Dakota) and Dr. Mary Bouxsein (Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School), respectively. For select studies, genetically–engineered
mice will be relocated to Dr. Edward Guo’s laboratory at Columbia University’s Department of Biomedical
Engineering for the measurement of fat depots by µCT (VivaCT-40). Finally, and importantly, Core A will
continue to maintain our MediaLab Document Control System as a repository for data re–analysis, cross–
institutional validation, and overall provenance. All U19 investigators will have unfettered access to all data
files, supporting our continued attempts to ensure rigor and transparency."
10764103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Extensive testing of our therapeutic candidate, MS-Hu6 in Projects 1 and 3 will require that we produce,
purify and test 7.5 g of antibody over ~4 years. The primary function of the Antibody Production and Testing
Core (APTC, Core B) thus remains to scale up the production and purification of MS-Hu6, and when required,
the parent molecule, Hf2. Towards Specific Aim 1, we currently have stably–transfected CHO-K1 cells and
Hf2 hybridomas, and are producing antibodies en masse in 3–liter spinner flasks, followed by FPLC purification
using HiTrap Protein G columns. We have also developed a final formulation for MS-Hu6 that provides
thermal and accelerated stability, prevents aggregation and degradation, maintains structural integrity, and
enables retained FSH binding. Thus, in Specific Aim 2, we propose to evaluate the physicochemical
properties of each batch of MS-Hu6 using a battery of tests––protein thermal shift assay, size exclusion
chromatography, dynamic light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, accelerated stability testing, tests
for viscosity, turbidity and clarity, circular dichroism spectroscopy, Fourier–transform infrared spectroscopy,
hydrophobic–, self–, and cross–interaction chromatography, and ELISAs for polyspecificity and FSH binding.
This expansion allows us to determine if each batch of purified MS-Hu6 meets strict industry standards.
Towards, Specific Aim 3, Core B will continue to confirm the binding affinity (KD) of each batch of MS-Hu6 to
mouse and human FSH by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and validate FSH–blocking activity using both
osteoclast– and adipocyte–based in vitro assays, and when required, in vivo confirmation using the
ThermoMouse. As we move MS-Hu6 into the clinic, Core B will also extend these capabilities to test small
batches of clinical–grade MS-Hu6 once our master cell bank is ready for manufacturing and continue to
support U01 AG073148 and R01 AG074092. Overall, we propose Core B as a mature, ongoing and expanded
asset to the U19 renewal application."
10764104,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 We and others have shown that blocking FSH action either pharmacologically or genetically prevents both
osteoporosis and obesity [e.g. Cell, 2006, PMID: 16630814; Nature, 2017, PMID: 28538730]1-7. More recently,
we reported that FSH also acts on hippocampal neurons to trigger neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease
(AD) mice, and that blocking FSH action prevents the onset of AD–like features [Nature, 2022, PMID:
35236988]8. Towards intercepting FSH actions on bone, body fat and brain, we recently developed a therapeutic
FSH–blocking antibody––MS-Hu6––that acts by binding to a 13–amino–acid–long epitope on FSHβ to prevent
its access to the FSH receptor (FSHR)9. Towards its future use in people, MS-Hu6 has undergone early–stage
testing. We find that it has a high affinity for FSH (KD=7,52 nM), displays a β phase t1/2 of 7.5 days, distributes
to bone, fat and brain, is safe when injected into monkeys, and is thermostable [PNAS, 2020, PMD: 33127753;
eLife, 2022, PMID: 36125123]2,9. The NIA–sponsored SWAN Study teaches us that, during the menopausal
transition, when serum FSH rises in the face of unperturbed estrogen, there is a sharp reduction in bone mass,
onset of visceral adiposity, and spikes in cognitive decline10-12. We believe that MS-Hu6 could potentially be
used to prevent three diseases of public health magnitude—all at once––within this FSH–high/estrogen–replete
window. A broader question, however, arises whether, in addition to preventing their onset, can MS-Hu6 be
purposed for treating established osteoporosis, obesity and AD—the armamentarium of therapies for which
pales in comparison to that for diabetes, hypertension or cancer. Contemporaneously reproduced in the Rosen
lab, we find that MS-Hu6 does stimulate new bone formation, and, in doing so, reverses lost bone in young mice.
We hypothesize that MS-Hu6 will not only prevent, but also cure established osteoporosis, obesity and AD in
aged mice. For this, we will use a two–pronged approach for blocking FSH action: pharmacologic by MS-Hu6
and/or genetic by abrogating the Fshr conditionally in 18–month–old mice. Specific Aim 1 will study the effects
of this strategy by comprehensively phenotyping skeletons of old gonadectomized male and female mice
following FSH blockade. In Specific Aim 2, we will induce obesity in old mice and administer MS-Hu6 or delete
FSHRs globally, followed by detailed body composition and metabolic studies, with the expectation of achieving
a lean, thermogenic phenotype. For Specific Aim 3, we will age APP-KI mice, which harbor human APP
substitutions, and begin injecting MS-Hu6 once deficits in cued and recognition memory set in—followed by
detailed neurophenotyping. Together, these studies should not only allow us to understand how aging bone, fat
tissue and brain respond to FSH perturbations, but also provide proof–of–concept for future clinical studies.
These experiments will be performed on our Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Platform [per Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 21, Part 58] and used for our Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA."
10764105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 We have identified FSH as an actionable target for osteoporosis, obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD)—
diseases that affect millions of men and women worldwide [e.g. Cell, 2006, PMID: 16630814; Nature, 2017,
PMID: 28538730; Nature, 2022, PMID: 35236988]1-8. SWAN (NIA) shows that these diseases track together
during the menopausal transition when FSH rises while estrogen remains unperturbed—implicating FSH as a
disease driver9-13. FSH blockade in mouse models of osteoporosis, obesity and AD prevents disease onset4-
6,8,14. We thus developed a lead therapeutic—MS-Hu6—which is currently undergoing preclinical evaluation
[PNAS, 2020, PMD: 33127753; eLife, 2022, PMID: 36125123]2,15. Project 1 will focus on testing the efficacy of
MS-Hu6 in models of established disease toward future clinical studies. Mechanistically, however, several
issues arise from prior studies, which will be the focus of Project 2. First, while we and others have established
FSH receptor (FSHR) expression in bone cells4-6,16, we are unclear which of the three cell types—osteoblasts,
osteocytes or osteoclasts—mediate FSH action on bone mass. While global FSHR haploinsufficiency results in
impaired osteoclastic bone resorption6, FSH–blocking antibodies also unmask potent bone anabolic effects
[PNAS, 2012, PMID: 22908268; PNAS, 2018, PMID: 29440419]2,4,14. In wild type mice, where resorption is not
ordinarily elevated, MS-Hu6 increases osteoblastic bone formation2. Furthermore, prior studies were performed
in young mice, leaving open a further question on how bone responds to FSH blockade over the lifetime of a
mouse—this is particularly relevant to older women, where we find that FSH levels correlate with bone mineral
density and fracture risk [JCEM, 2021, PMID: 33326040]17. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, to determine which bone
cell is the primary FSH target, we will delete FSHRs selectively in osteoblasts, osteocytes or osteoclasts by
crossing Fshrfl/fl mice with tamoxifen–inducible Cre lines. We will then phenotype the skeletons of the mutants
over their lifetime and following gonadectomy. We have also shown that FSH is a pro–obesity hormone and that
genetic or pharmacologic ablation induces a lean, thermogenic phenotype5. While FSHRs are expressed in
adipocytes5, we also find expression in hypothalamic and hindbrain nuclei that transmit sympathetic signals
peripherally to adipose tissue [eLife, 22022, PMID: 36052994]18. It is therefore imperative that we understand
the contribution of peripheral versus central effects of FSH on body composition. In Specific Aim 2, we will
delete Fshr selectively in adipocytes by crossing Fshrfl/fl mice with doxycycline–inducible Adipoq-CrertTA,tetO mice,
and use UCP1–reporter ThermoMice to study beiging. In parallel, we will inject siFshr stereotactically into
FSHR–rich hypothalamic nuclei18. Following Fshr deletion, mutant mice will be put on a high–diet and undergo
detailed body composition and metabolic phenotyping. In all, these studies should establish the mechanism of
FSH action on bone and body fat, and in doing so, inform ongoing preclinical and future clinical investigations
with MS-Hu6."

The overarching goal of this R21 proposal is to explore the potential of nelfinavir, a widely used antiviral agent,
as a modulator to significantly augment the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy against melanoma.
Melanoma, one of the most aggressive and fatal neoplasms, is responsible for over 80% of skin cancer-related
deaths. Despite recent advances in treatment for this devastating disease, including surgical resection,
targeted therapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of patients with melanoma remains dismal. Cellular therapy
using ACT approach represents a particularly promising strategy to treatment of this malignancy; yet, the
therapeutic outcomes remain elusive due to a variety of factors that limits the anti-tumor immunity. We recently
revealed the critical roles of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K) in promoting the survival and
cytocidal activity of CD8+ T cells and in augmenting the antitumor activity of CAR-T therapy, suggesting the
potential of manipulating this kinase in boosting immunotherapy against melanoma. eEF-2K belongs to the
family of atypical α-kinases and is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of protein synthesis. This kinase
phosphorylates eEF-2, a 100 kDa protein that promotes ribosomal translocation from the A to the P-site, the
reaction that induces movement of mRNA along the ribosome during translation. Phosphorylated eEF2 is
unable to catalyze ribosomal translocation, thereby inhibiting peptide elongation. Notably, studies showed that
eEF-2K can be activated by nelfinavir, an orally bioavailable antiviral agent that have been widely used in
clinical treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection such as HIV and AIDS, and that activation of eEF-
2K in tumor cells promotes tumor cell death and suppresses tumor progression. Thus, based on our
observation of the role of eEF-2K in reinvigoration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells as well as the above studies, we
hypothesize that pharmacologic activation of eEF-2K by nelfinavir can be exploited as a novel and effective
therapeutic approach to substantially augment the efficacy of ACT against melanoma. Addressing this
hypothesis would provide a proof of concept and rationale for improving the efficacy of current anti-melanoma
therapies through targeting eEF-2K by use of nelfinavir. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize the effects
of nelfinavir on cytotoxic T lymphocytes including T cell functions, persistence, and stability, and evaluate the
impact of nelfinavir on reinforcing the efficacy of ACT against melanoma through use of in vitro and in vivo
melanoma models. Successful completion of this study may provide a rapid path to enter clinical trials of
nelfinavir in treatment of patients with immune poor-responsive melanoma, yielding new therapeutic
opportunities to significantly improve current melanoma treatment through use of nelfinavir."
10766986,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Pharmacoepidemiology is a bridge science that uses tools from pharmacology, epidemiology and clinical
medicine to understand the use, safety and effectiveness of drugs in large populations. The need for experts in
this field is as great as ever before. During the past decade, dozens of new therapies have been brought to
market, including products made from living cells, or biologics, to address common and costly heart, lung and
blood conditions ranging from cystic fibrosis to thromboembolism to Hemophilia A. With the rise in access to
promising yet expensive drugs comes the need to study their benefits and risks in diverse populations as well
as to understand best use of these medicines to improve human health. In addition, many of
pharmacoepidemiology’s tools and methods are also highly relevant to the study of use, safety and effectiveness
of other medical products including diagnostics, devices, and drug-device combinations. We propose to renew
our heretofore highly successful training program in pharmacoepidemiology for pre- and post-doctoral trainees
at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. These
institutions remain exceptionally well suited to this task. The Bloomberg School of Public Health is the oldest and
largest School of Public Health in the world, while the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is an internationally
renowned leader in scientific research and clinical medicine. Continuing our program will leverage a wealth of
human capital and material resources at Johns Hopkins to provide comprehensive, longitudinal, and integrated
training and professional development opportunities to future leaders in the field. We will use this award to train
scientists who will identify and address fundamental questions about the use, safety and effectiveness of
medicines and other medical products for the treatment of heart, lung and blood diseases. Given the strengths
of our faculty and trainee pool, we will also support the development of innovative methods to do so. Thus, our
trainees will develop skills to generate evidence that can be used to address the needs of patients, clinicians,
payers, regulators and other stakeholders, and in so doing, improve the optimal use of medicines to treat heart,
lung and blood diseases in the United States."

Texas HOPE: Together Dissolving Food Insecurity Structural Barriers
Abstract
The Asian American Health Coalition of the Greater Houston Area dba HOPE Clinic and our
partners share the mission of health and wellbeing equity for everyone without prejudice. In our
proposal, “Texas HOPE: Together Dissolving Food Insecurity Structural Barriers,” we declare our
commitment to ending food insecurity, an intractable harm endured by our most vulnerable and
marginalized families and individuals. In our study region, Texas’ greater Houston area,
approximately 695,310 individuals endure food insecurity, including 1 in 5 children. Food
insecurity disproportionally impacts disadvantaged groups, who represent 80% of the population
in our areas: 45% Hispanic, 23.5% Black, and 12.2% Asian American or Pacific Islander. Using an
authentic community engagement participatory process, we will establish a CHESI Collaborative
of partners and use the Precede Proceed approach to plan and develop our structural
intervention CHESI study. Together, will we engage stakeholders and those with lived experience
to provide their perspectives and insight on food insecurity structural barriers, complete a
community assessment, and consider interventions. Concurrently, the CHESI Collaborative will
devise a sustainability plan that will ensure the intervention persists. With our local HERA, we will
compile multisource evidence, examine intervention options, and identify health and wellbeing
measures most influenced by food insecurity. The CHESI Collaborative will again reach out to our
community, garnering input on the draft intervention and implementation plan. Community
involvement will provide pivotal insight on considerations and potential challenges for the
successful rollout of the intervention. In preparation for Phase 2, HERA will devise a rigorous
research methodology that best suits the intervention."
10778618,"Our concepts of platelet and megakaryocyte (Mk) origins and functions continue to expand. Mks are found in
extramedullary tissues, including the lungs and spleen. We have shown that platelets initiate, accelerate, and
regulate all phases of the immune responses and have now discovered that Mks have immune plasticity and
functions that are dependent on their tissue environment. This includes our discovery that lung Mks take up,
process, and present pathogen derived antigens to T cells. Our studies lead us to now hypothesize that: Mk
differentiation is responsive to, and dictated by, environmental pathogens and/or stimuli. Our data also
presents questions related to extramedullary Mk origins and differentiation. We will leverage the unique
expertise of our collaborative team by using disease relevant in vitro and in vivo mouse model systems to explore
this novel research inquiry.
Proposed studies in this application will explore whether Mks differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells outside
the bone marrow, determine the environmental regulators of Mk phenotype plasticity, and potential roles for
extramedullary Mks in all phases of the immune responses. These studies will establish that tissue resident Mks
have environmentally regulated roles in immune responses, changing how we view Mk and platelet functions,
thereby impacting our understanding of major causes of morbidity and mortality. This includes infectious
diseases such as bacterial pneumonias or viral infections (examples; influenza and coronavirus). To accomplish
these paradigm shifting goals, we will pursue the following Aims:
Aim #1. To demonstrate mechanisms of tissue dependent Mk differentiation.
Aim #2. To demonstrate megakaryocyte immune regulatory roles."
10762978,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Warmer temperatures have been associated with increased virus transmission and emergence of novel
pathogens and vectors in new locations. Temperature is well documented to have a significant effect on viral
fitness and replication, which is particularly relevant in ectothermic vectors of enzootic viruses such as
mosquitoes. Temperature also impacts numerous aspects of invertebrate biology and therefore is a critical
factor influencing the transmission potential of vector populations. Studies to date which aim to model
environmental effects on population level viral dynamics assume static biological systems. Given the strong
effects of temperature on viral replication rates (and consequently evolutionary rates), the variability of vector
species and population responses to temperature, and the documented role of interactions among viral
genotype and environment in governing transmission, this assumption is flawed. This represents a clear gap in
our understanding of pathogen transmission theory and a barrier to developing accurate predictive models.
West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is the most prevalent arbovirus in the U.S. and the ideal
candidate for modeling how temperature and viral genotype interact to influence transmission and evolution of
arboviruses in dynamic vector populations. There is large variability in prevalence in mosquitoes over both fine
and broad temporal and geographic scales, and this variability has been well-documented in the U.S. Variation
in temperature and viral genotypes have also been documented over similar scales. We will utilize novel
laboratory data to refine predictions of arbovirus transmission under various evolutionary and climate
scenarios, and ultimately to create more informed predictive models that should have broader implications for
vector-borne pathogens."

Imaging the tumor microenvironment (TME) is key to understanding tumor growth, disease
progression and therapy options. The TME often consists of a complex neighborhood of diverse
populations of immune cells, fibroblasts, and tumors cells. Little is known about the “geography”
of the tumors and the spatial organization of the distinct cell types. The ability to rapidly identify
different cell types and tumor subtypes using molecular markers will be transformative for cancer
diagnostics.
At Spatial Genomics, we are commercializing technology that allows transcript profiling in tumor
samples. With this technology, cell types in situ and spatial organizations can be directly identified
and visualized in tumor tissue slices. These capabilities provide a powerful tool for examining the
different cell types and their interactions in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will
develop the reagents, instrumentation, and the associated software that will allow researchers to
perform spatial mapping experiments in tumor slices."
10762954,"To understand the social determinants of health and address persistent disparities in healthy aging,
researchers and policymakers have increasingly taken a life course view of social exposures. Conditions of
early and midlife are implicated in empirical studies of later life health and health disparities by gender, race
and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. A better understanding of the long-term influences of complex and
time-varying health, socioeconomic, psychosocial and environmental exposures is essential for evaluating
theories of the life course, cumulative advantage and health disparities, and for designing interventions to
foster healthy aging for all. Key methodological advances in the collection of retrospective life history (RLH)
data have enabled major ongoing longitudinal studies of aging, including the English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing (ELSA), the Survey of Health and Ageing in Europe (SHARE), and the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), to fill in life course gaps quickly and cost-effectively by collecting information using the event history
calendar approach. The data from RLH interviews can be used to generate measures of schooling,
relationship, parenting, employment, financial and residential histories; life events like health shocks; presence
and quality of social network relationships; and behaviors like tobacco use or health care utilization. However,
the reliability of RLH interview data has not been comprehensively evaluated against the survey “gold
standard” of prospectively-collected information. The few assessments of RLH data quality have focused on
different domains of the life course, but each has revealed evidence of recall error (especially by duration since
event and complexity of reporting task) and recall bias (especially by age, gender and sometimes race and
education), though findings remain mixed and incomplete. We propose to build on the existing prospective
Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) study, a multi-racial, nationally-representative cohort study that has
collected measures from across major life domains and of aging-related morbidities over the adult lifespan.
The ACL-6 wave is currently in the field, and will provide 33 years of exposure measures. We will field a RLH
interview similar to the one used by SHARE (ACL-LIFE) and conduct an innovative, integrated set of analyses
to more comprehensively examine the prevalence, dimensions, and sociodemographic determinants of
mismatch between retrospectively- and prospectively-collected life history information than has been possible
to date. We will also explore whether and how reliance on RLH data could influence conclusions about healthy
aging or health disparities drawn from analyses using life course exposures as predictors. These novel
assessments will inform research on survey methodology and enhance the value of major ongoing longitudinal
studies of aging. They will also provide critical findings for researchers and policy makers reliant on cost-
effective and timely information about life course exposures that can be used to improve the lives of all adults,
and to eliminate disparities in healthy aging."
10868446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer deaths, and standard-of-care treatments fail to
effectively target metastasizing cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream rely on the physical
protection and chemical signals of platelets to survive and seed metastatic lesions. One such chemical signal is
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which, after secretion by platelets, has been shown to modulate CTC
gene expression and behavior. TGF-β has also been shown to upregulate expression of the cell-surface
glycoprotein Mucin-4 (MUC4) in various cellular contexts. MUC4 has been implicated in tumor development and
maintenance and was recently observed to contribute to platelet-CTC interactions. This raises the question of
whether platelet-secreted TGF-β may be upregulating CTC-MUC4, enhancing platelet-CTC interaction and
generating a positive feedback loop. The hypothesis driving the proposed studies is that platelet-TGF-β
upregulates CTC-MUC4, reinforcing CTC-platelet binding and enhancing metastatic cell survival. Specific Aim 1
will determine the effects of platelet-derived TGF-β on tumor cell MUC4 expression using cellular, molecular,
and biochemical techniques, and assess MUC4-dependent cellular aggressiveness in vitro. Specific Aim 2 will
characterize the role of MUC4 in platelet-tumor cell interactions using in vitro binding assays. Specific Aim 3 will
assess the effects of platelet-TGF-β and CTC-MUC4 crosstalk in vivo using tail vein and orthotopic xenograft
tumor mouse models of metastasis. Successful completion of this research will reveal a novel form of platelet-
CTC crosstalk, exposing an important means by which metastasizing cells survive and illuminating a potential
new therapeutic target for breast cancer metastatic prevention."

The goal of this project is to develop small molecule modulators of RuvBL1/L2 complex as potential therapies
for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by targeting DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair pathways. TNBC
is a subgroup of breast cancer and is molecularly characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) amplification. DNA
replication stress and reactive oxygen species are prevalent in TNBC cells due to activation of various
oncogenes. Thus, TNBC cells constantly generate DSBs. In order for the TNBC cells to survive, these lethal
DSBs must be repaired. Accordingly, over the course of development of cancer, TNBC cells have co-evolved
efficient DSB repair mechanisms that protect them from the endogenous lethal DSBs. Therefore, targeting
DNA repair pathways has been proposed as a potentially powerful strategy to develop novel therapeutics for
TNBC. By exploiting this unique feature of endogenous DSBs prevalent only in TNBC cells, such therapeutics
can offer selective toxicity to TNBC cells without harming normal cells. We recently identified a novel small
molecule lead compound to target RuvBL1/L2 to inhibit DSB repair in TNBC cells. In this application, we
propose to further develop this small molecule lead compound for the treatment of TNBC with 3 specific aims.
In aim 1, we will study the mechanism of action of this novel lead compound. In aim 2, we will optimize this
lead compound using different medicinal chemistry strategies. In aim 3, we will investigate the optimized
compounds' anti-TNBC efficacy in different preclinical models alone and in combination with PARP inhibitors."

The choroid plexus (ChP) comprises a network of cells that form a critical brain barrier that can mediate
secondary damage in certain brain disorders and trauma. The Lehtinen lab has developed a suite of tools to
study the ChP across development ex vivo and in vivo. This project applies imaging technology to study blood-
CSF barrier permeability regulation at the cellular level. Our overarching hypothesis is that the intracellular
messenger cAMP regulates endothelial tight junctions between ChP epithelial cells and thereby blood-CSF
barrier integrity as it does in the nearby blood-brain barrier (BBB). The main effectors of cAMP, PKA and Epac,
regulate endothelial tight junction redistribution and barrier permeability. Gi/o-linked G-Protein Coupled
Receptors (GPCRs) are strong upstream regulators of cAMP. The Lehtinen laboratory's single nucleus
sequencing data suggest that ChP epithelial cells selectively and developmentally express mGlur8, which via
Gαi, activation in other brain tissues inhibits cAMP production. To elucidate mechanisms of neurotransmitter
alteration of the blood-CSF barrier we will study the cellular mechanisms of neurotransmitter-activated GPCR-
cAMP signaling in ChP epithelial cells. The Lehtinen lab, in collaboration with co-sponsor Mark Andermann's
lab, recently established a protocol for ex vivo and in vivo imaging of ChP structure and function based on
using fluorescent reporters of calcium activity. I will apply these techniques to reveal how GPCRs modulate
cAMP levels using fluorescent cAMP indicators in ChP explants (Aim 1). In Aim 2 we will use an in vivo
preparation to map the populations of receptors that are accessible to central vs peripheral ligands. Those
located on the apical membrane are in contact with the CSF and those on the basal surface are exposed to the
blood. With functional assays including peripheral delivery of low molecular weight fluorescent dyes, we will
assess the effects of central (CSF) vs peripheral (intravenous) delivered ligands such as mGluR8 agonists on
cAMP and blood-CSF barrier permeability. Together these studies will reveal mechanisms how
neurotransmitters, specifically glutamate, may contribute to blood-CSF barrier integrity in health and disease.
The research and training proposed will take place at Boston Children's Hospital, a world-renowned pediatric
hospital that offers an exceptional research environment and countless opportunities to carry research from
bench to bedside. Importantly, the research proposed will take place under the guidance of Dr. Maria Lehtinen,
an expert in the field of choroid plexus and CSF biology. In addition, Dr. Mark Andermann (co-mentor) is a
leader in in vivo optical imaging techniques. The results from this proposal will result in first-authored
publications and a wealth of preliminary data for a competitive K99/R00 application. This fellowship will provide
the candidate with the opportunity to begin training in choroid plexus biology and make significant scientific
contributions while also helping launch an independent academic career."

 Diet has a profound impact on organismal health. Fasting improves human health in part by reducing
inflammation, decreasing oxidative damage and extending longevity, however, the mechanisms by which fasting
improves intestinal regeneration remains poorly understood. The intestinal epithelium renews fastidiously every
5-7 days via Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5+) expressing intestinal stem
cells (ISCs) found at the base of the intestinal crypt. LGR5+ ISCs balance differentiation and epithelial cell
divisions to influence tissue regeneration by integrating metabolic and signaling cues from their environment like
diet. Fasting has a profound effect on ISC function in young and aged mice and can improve the age-associated
decline in tissue regeneration through the induction of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a process that oxidizes fatty
acids into acetyl-CoA units. In addition, LGR5+ ISCs strongly express 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
synthetase 2 (HMGCS2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the ketogenic pathway whereby acetyl-CoA units are
converted to ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (bOHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Mechanistically,
bOHB reinforces the NOTCH signaling pathway by inhibiting class I histone-deacetylases (HDACs) to instruct
ISC cell fate decisions. These findings further support a nuanced relationship between host nutritional state and
stem cell function whereby dynamic control of ISC bOHB levels enable their rapid adaptation to diverse
physiological states such as fasting. Other roles for ISC-derived ketone body metabolites have yet to be
elucidated and, as such, we propose that bOHB and AcAc function as distinct signaling metabolites regulating
ISC fasting responses (Aim 1) and have unique roles as energetic substrates (Aim 2). To test this hypothesis,
we will use key genetic mouse models to understand how perturbed bOHB/AcAc ratios alter intestinal stem cell
function in vivo and in vitro (Aim 1), as well as labelled substrate administration and novel techniques for rapid
mitochondrial isolation to determine key ISC metabolic adaptations to fasting (Aim 2). Taken together, the
experiments proposed will mechanistically delineate the signaling and energetic roles of ketone body metabolites
on intestinal stemness and improve our understanding of how the fasting response via ketone bodies influences
intestinal regeneration. We expect this approach will identify therapeutic options exploiting ketone bodies and
the signaling and energetic pathways engaged by them to enhance intestinal regeneration in cases of injury and
age-related decline of stem cell function."

Physical inactivity is a significant health problem, affecting females more than males. Physical inactivity tends
to track over time and many young children aged 3 or 4 years are physically inactive. Therefore, understanding
when and how physical activity habits develop requires investigation starting at age 2 years or younger. In
toddler (age 1 or 2 years) physical activity research, however, a major methodological gap exists regarding
physical activity measurement, particularly related to accelerometer data processing. This gap limits our ability
to accurately estimate physical activity levels among toddlers. To process accelerometer data, an intensity-
based accelerometer count cut-point approach has been widely used. However, the cut-points suggested for
toddlers have been found to present low accuracy (≤58%). A new analytic approach, machine learning, has
been shown to provide more accurate activity classification among preschoolers and older children. Our pilot
study also suggests that the machine learning approach has great potential for toddler activity recognition. The
overarching goal of this proposed study is to better understand the development of physical activity behavior in
early childhood using an accurate physical activity measurement tool. The first aim is to develop and validate
an accelerometer-based machine learning algorithm for toddler activity recognition. The second aim is to
describe the trajectory of physical activity levels from age 12 to 36 months by sex. To achieve these aims, we
will recruit 124 children at approximate age 12 months from various pediatric clinics in Chicago and conduct
five waves of assessments at participant age 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months (waves 1 to 5). We will collect
accelerometer and video data (ground truth) in five free-living settings (home, childcare class, indoor playroom,
outdoor playground, and car-ride) in waves 1 to 4. The data will be split into a training set and a testing set.
The training dataset will be used to develop an activity recognition algorithm and the testing dataset will be
used to evaluate the newly developed algorithm. We will also conduct 7-day accelerometer assessments at
each of the five waves. Applying the algorithm developed in AIM 1, we will estimate daily time spent in
walking/running (minutes/day) and overall physical activity (minutes/day). We will use growth curve models to
examine the trajectories of walking/running time and overall physical activity time over age between 12 and 36
months, including sex as a predictor. This study will help to fill the methodological gap in toddler physical
activity measurement and expand the body of knowledge in early childhood physical activity."
10755312,"Abstract
Insulin resistance is a major cause of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D), heart attacks, strokes
and cancer. Only one class of medications, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), specifically targets insulin resistance
primarily by activating the transcription factor PPARG in adipocytes. While TZDs have proven clinically
effective in preventing T2D, heart attacks and strokes, serious side effects have limited their clinical use. New
therapeutic targets to combat insulin resistance are needed. In theory, the gene expression changes caused
by TZD-treatment could be mined for novel insulin-sensitizing effectors, but TZDs alter the expression of
hundreds of genes. These must be sifted by functional investigation for causal effectors versus merely
correlated or toxic bystanders. Standard laboratory-based functional investigation requires invasive
physiological measurements in model systems that are difficult to scale. Even when a potential insulin
sensitizing effector gene is validated in the lab, credentialing its relevance to human insulin sensitivity
necessitates drug development and human trials, another poorly scalable process that usually results in failure
for lack of efficacy. However, the recent accumulation of genome sequences in large, clinically characterized
populations has revealed that nature has performed countless human trials in the form of millions of naturally
occurring, protein-altering genetic variants scattered throughput almost every gene in the genome. The key to
unlocking both these opportunities: 1) identifying novel candidate genes from TZD treatment and 2) leveraging
nature’s clinical trials for assessing therapeutic potential, are high-throughput functional assays. In this
application, we propose to utilize a newly developed massively parallel adipocyte differentiation/ lipid
accumulation assay in an integrative genomic approach to:
Aim 1: Rapidly sort TZD-altered genes for likelihood of being insulin sensitizing effectors and
Aim 2: Credential already identified and novel candidates for therapeutic potential in humans using data from
100,000 sequenced individuals.
This work will produce a systematic dissection of the therapeutic effect of TZDs to identify novel insulin
sensitivity genes and directly assess the therapeutic potential of modulating function in humans for four of
these genes."

Force generation in epithelial tissues is often pulsatile, with actomyosin networks generating high-tension
contractile forces at the cell cortex before cyclically disassembling. This pulsed nature of cytoskeletal forces
implies that there must be cellular processes to extract unidirectional changes that drive processive
transformations in cell shape. In previous work (Jewett et al., 2017; Miao et al., 2019), we found that
cytoskeletal force generation is coordinated with endocytic remodeling of the plasma membrane through Sbf-
Rab35 tubular compartmental function to stabilize contracted cell surfaces and permit the shrinking of cell
apices (apical constriction) or cell interfaces (cell intercalation). However, how this membranous cellular
ratchet becomes engaged at particular cell surfaces remains unclear. In the proposed studies, we will
examine the informational signals that engage ratcheting and direct Sbf/Rab35 compartmental behaviors to
contracting interfaces or cell apices, and identify the fundamental changes in oscillatory durations, amplitudes,
frequencies, and/or directionality that lead to contractile processivity. Our preliminary data indicates the PIP3 is
a critical determinant for ratcheting engagement – through our proposed work we will perform the first
characterization of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in providing lipid-based membrane cues for
morphogenesis and gastrulation/ratcheting dynamics in the early Drosophila embryo. In the first aim, we will
also analyze how the plasma membrane ultrastructure is remodeled by ratcheting processes and determine if
PIP levels are developmentally patterned to drive apical constriction during mesoderm ingression. Our project
then moves to a systematic identification of Sbf and Rab35 protein partners in directing ratcheting
engagement, and examines the cell signaling pathways that direct a “switching” behavior of contractile force
generation from the apical surface to cell interfaces. Our data indicates that, in the absence of JAK/STAT
signaling, the Sbf-Rab35 ratchet becomes engaged on all apical surfaces in the embryo, resulting in global
apical flattening and constriction. Further, our studies will define if a larger Upd-JAK-STAT-Pi3K-PIP3-Sbf-
Rab35 pathway or if two independent pathways (PIP3 and JAK/STAT) have been coordinated to regulate
ratcheting engagement. We also apply a new computational phase-based osculating circle approach to detect
active periods of contraction and expansion displacements. Finally, we are developing a new mito-tag ectopic
relocalization assay as a measure of “sufficiency” of recruiting factors in vivo, and examine if the Akt/mTOR
pathway regulates cell ratcheting, potentially demonstrating a new, highly novel function of Akt/mTOR in
controlling epithelial cell topologies. Thus, the planned project has the potential to elucidate a large, regulatory
hierarchy of the mechanisms that guide engagement of cell ratcheting in epithelial tissues."

Over the past two decades, the role of astrocytes in brain physiology has become clearer. Astrocytes control
neuronal function by modulating synaptic transmission, ion gradients, and more. They sense and rapidly
respond to synaptic activity. Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is
essential for normal brain function. In the healthy brain, once released from neurons, glutamate is transported
into astrocytes by the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) GLT-1 and GLAST. Previously, using
iGluSnFR-based glutamate imaging and electrophysiology in the healthy adult mouse cortex, our lab has shown
that glutamate uptake is slowed up to threefold following bursts of neuronal activity. We suspected that this
occurs because neuronal activity generates action potentials, causing focal increases in extracellular potassium
([K+]e). We showed that increases in [K+]e drives local astrocyte depolarization, causing voltage-dependent
inhibition of EAATs and prolonging extracellular glutamate transients. Our model suggests that dysregulation of
both EAATs and astrocytic K+ uptake, mediated by the K+ channel Kir4.1, can both contribute to disrupted
glutamate dynamics, but the exact role these channels and transporters play is unknown. We hypothesize that
EAATs, like GLT-1, drive uptake while Kir4.1 shapes activity-dependent slowing of glutamate.
This F99/K00 D-SPAN proposal encompasses 2 Aims detailing my goals and objectives. In Aim 1, I describe my
progress thus far as well as my proposed research to complete my Ph.D. Key preliminary data using the
controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice show 3 days after injury (1) glutamate
decay time constants are slowed, (2) peak glutamate response is increased, (3) GLT-1 expression is decreased,
and (4) Kir4.1 expression is not altered. To better understand Kir4.1’s importance to glutamate clearance, we
will utilize a Kir4.1fl/fl mouse line and AAVs to conditionally and focally knockout Kir4.1 in astrocytes. When
completed, this study will provide novel insight into how glutamate dynamics are altered by TBI, the role of Kir4.1
in shaping glutamate uptake, and how these molecular changes in astrocytes drive synaptic activity.
In Aim 2, I outline my post-doctoral aspirations of studying glial function and how glia contribute to neurological
disease. I will identify a strong post-doctoral laboratory and institution that promotes innovative scientific
research, collaboration, diversity, professional growth, and pushes forward the biomedical field. With the support
of my sponsor, Dr. Chris Dulla, I have grown as a scientist by attending multiple conferences and workshops,
published in high impact journals, and grown in my confidence. I have identified my strengths and areas for
growth as a scientist, mentor, and member of the scientific community. Ultimately, I believe I am at a perfect
juncture to appreciate and benefit from such a fantastic opportunity to be a part of the D-SPAN community and
this award will propel me in my academic and professional pursuits of being an independent research scientist."

The overall goal of the MARCH Training Component is to enhance knowledge and skills for investigators and community
partners to conduct research and improve care for pregnant women to reduce the risk of pregnancy-associated
mortality and morbidity in rural and American Indian communities. The training component activities align with the
thematic focus of MARCH – improving access and accessibility of care and enhancing the understanding of key barriers
and facilitators for change. To that end, the training activities will engage and support community partners and MARCH
investigators by enhancing knowledge about the influence of the sociocultural, economic, and regulatory landscape on
healthcare access for rural pregnant and postnatal women. The training component will provide training on two broad
overarching areas that apply across all research projects and community partners - enhancing efforts to improve cultural
competency and research literacy for investigators and community partners. Additionally, training to enhance
knowledge and skills related to specific project areas will be provided. The provision of continued professional
development is an important component of training activities for research staff. Finally, the training component will
focus on creating a pipeline of researchers committed to a research career in maternal health through structured
mentorship, skill development, and community engagement experiences derived from long-standing community
partnerships. Building community relationships can take a long time. MARCH will allow early-stage investigators and
students to use this platform to springboard their own relationships and research programs."

 The goal of this project is to determine the activity-dependent mechanisms involved in contextual memory
formation in the hippocampal circuit of the CA3. Encoding memory requires activity-dependent changes to
neuronal properties and circuits, and improper function of these processes is thought to contribute to many
cognitive disorders. Contextual memory, in particular, requires the storage of environmental information
accompanying a salient stimulus to encode the context in which an experience occurred. The CA3 region of the
hippocampus is known to play a critical role in contextual memory due to extensive connections between its
pyramidal neurons, the principal excitatory neurons of the circuit. Changes in the CA3 circuit during learning and
memory, however, remain poorly understood. An emerging strategy in identifying active neuronal ensembles
during learning and memory is through detecting expression of immediate early genes. Known to rapidly turn on
upon the detection of cellular activity, immediate early gene expression is heterogenous across neuronal
populations. The transcription factor Npas4, an IEG expressed upon neuronal depolarization, has recently been
shown to activate during contextual memory tasks. Moreover, conditional knockout of Npas4 in the CA3 region
impairs contextual memory recall, suggesting that activity in the Npas4+ neuronal ensemble in this circuit is
required for proper contextual memory function. Recent evidence strongly suggest that contextual fear
conditioning induces changes at dentate granule cell to Npas4+ CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. The full extent
to how CA3 pyramidal neurons in the Npas4+ ensemble changes through activity, however, remains unknown.
Previous evidence in areas such as CA1 and sensory cortices suggest that Npas4+ neurons exhibit changes in
both excitatory and inhibitory drive through synapse formation and elimination. To study the changes in neuronal
function and circuit activity in the CA3 in the Npas4+ ensemble, an Npas4-specific Robust Activity Marking
system (NRAM) will be employed to identify neurons active during a contextual memory task. Neurons recruited
to the Npas4 ensemble will be assessed through electrophysiology and structural studies to determine changes
in synaptic transmission, morphology, and intrinsic properties that contribute to memory formation. Changes in
connectivity and circuit function will also be surveyed to determine larger scale changes to the CA3 network in
the encoding of contextual memory. Finally, the necessity and sufficiency of the Npas4 neuronal ensemble, as
well as its relevance in other cognitive functions will be determined. The work proposed will elucidate
mechanisms of learning in the CA3 circuit, and provide a foundation in uncovering the molecular basis of
memory."

 Mitochondria are essential organelles that control the life and death of cells. Mitochondria are highly
dynamic: They grow, divide, and fuse, and when they eventually become damaged, undergo degradation
Mitochondrial division is mediated by a dynamin-related GTPase, DRP1, while fusion is mediated by two
dynamin-related GTPases, OPA1 and mitofusin. These GTPases are mutated in human diseases, including
neurodevelopmental disorder, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, and optic atrophy. Altered activities of these
proteins have also been linked to metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and age-related
neurodegeneration. My laboratory’s goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms that control mitochondrial
structure and translate the fundamental biology to disease interventions. In the past two decades, we have
identified and characterized the three essential GTPases in the core reactions of membrane fusion and
division. The roles of mitochondrial dynamics are ever-expanding, and now include size control of
mitochondria, their distribution and turnover, and differentiation of neurons, cardiomyocytes, stem cells, and
immune cells. Most recently, it became evident that the mechanisms of mitochondrial division and fusion are
much more complex than initially imagined, involving inter-organelle interactions and a feedback response that
monitors and tunes their balance. The emerging new biology is transforming the field of mitochondrial structure
and dynamics. In the next 5 years, we will address the important questions raised by this intellectual evolution.
 First, to our surprise, we found that DRP1 shapes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into tubules that form
contract sites with mitochondria. DRP1-produced ER-mitochondria contact sites strongly promote
mitochondrial division. We will investigate how DRP1 creates ER-mitochondria contact sites that
specifically function in mitochondrial division, associates with the ER, and deforms the ER membrane.
Second, we discovered a physiological pathway of mitochondrial turnover via DRP1-controlled, Parkin/PINK1-
independent mitophagy in mice. This pathway’s most upstream event is to recognize and mark damaged
mitochondria by ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Our initial experiments suggested that ubiquitination
occurs in two phases – reversible initiation and committed amplification. We will determine what
ubiquitinates mitochondria in each phase, and how the ubiquitin ligase complexes recognize and label
damaged mitochondria in vivo. Third, we found the first example of a stress response (MitoSafe) that senses
and adjusts the mitochondrial structure by controlling the balance between fusion and division. We will
explore the molecular basis of MitoSafe and its physiological roles in mice. The MIRA grant will enable
us to discover the new logics of mitochondrial structure and its physiological role and regulation in vivo."
10755717,"Project Summary
 The incentive value of drug-associated cues drives several facets of addiction, including escalation of
drug use and the propensity to relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Cues with high incentive value
can drive reward-seeking behaviors that are disconnected from an individual’s goals and the value of expected
outcomes (i.e. rewards or punishments). This may lead to perseverative or compulsive drug use despite
adverse consequences. A critical barrier to progress in neuromodulation-based treatments for addiction is lack
of knowledge regarding the circuits engaged in cue-driven reward-seeking behavior, and how these circuits are
distinct from those involved in goal-directed behavior, which relies on accurate mental representations of
expected outcomes and their value. This proposal focuses on the role of the ventral pallidum (VP), a region of
the basal forebrain that is critical for both relapse to drug use and positive affect. Our objective is to identify the
VP neural populations that encode the incentive value of cues, and the neural circuit mechanisms by which
cues drive motivated behavior. Our central hypothesis is that neurons that represent the incentive value of
cues are distinct from those that represent the expected value of future outcomes, and that these neurons can
be defined based on output pathway. We predict that the activity of GABAergic VP neurons projecting to the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) encodes cue-driven reward-seeking and that activity in this population is critical
for cue-driven motivated behavior. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following aims.
 In Aim 1 we will examine encoding of the incentive value of cues and expected value of outcomes by
individual neurons in VP. Our hypothesis is that separate neurons in VP encode incentive value and expected
value. We will use in vivo single unit electrophysiology to measure activity patterns in individual VP neurons
during presentations of reward-related cues and determine whether activity in these neurons predicts cue-
elicited reward-seeking behavior and/or the current expected value of a predicted outcome. In Aim 2 we will
identify the VP output pathway(s) that encode the incentive value of cues. Our hypothesis is that VP neurons
that encode incentive value are GABAergic and project to the VTA. We will use fiber photometry to measure
calcium signals in VP GABA neurons projecting to the VTA or thalamus during presentations of reward cues
and determine whether activity in these populations predicts cue-elicited reward-seeking behavior and/or
expected value. In Aim 3 we will test the functional role of activity in these VP output pathways in behavioral
responses to cues. Successful completion of this research will characterize the brain mechanisms of incentive
value representations and define the downstream circuit targets for the invigoration of motivated behavior by
VP incentive value signals. Advancements in our understanding of these circuits will contribute to the
refinement of brain-based therapies that target the neural mechanisms underlying compulsive drug use."

Background Information and Relevance: Glucocorticoids (GC) are widely used in ophthalmology and in
medicine in general. GC-induced ocular hypertension (OHTN) is a common complication that can be
potentially blinding. The rate of this complication for GC injected intravitreally varies between 28-34%
depending on the formulation injected. This complication's risk factors are not well understood but there is
long-standing evidence that genetic factors play a role. Few genetic studies have been undertaken to identify
the implicated variants and no consistent findings have been identified. Hypotheses: Genetic susceptibility to
GC-induced OHTN is due to both common and rare variation, and associated variants are more likely to be
found in genes with transcripts altered by exposure to GC as well as genes that have glucocorticoid response
elements (GREs) or have been associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or intraocular pressure
(IOP). Specific Objectives: 1.To characterize the GC transcriptome in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells
and Schlemm's canal endothelial (SCE) cells. 2. To perform genome-wide genotyping and whole exome
sequencing (WES) on 1086 patients with intravitreal GC injection exposure. 3. To identify common and rare
genetic variants in both coding and non-coding regions that are associated with GC-induced IOP elevation.
Methods: We will expose human TM and SCE cells to dexamethasone as well as media controls and perform
RNA sequencing to identify genes that are transcriptionally regulated by GCs. We will perform genome-wide
genotyping and WES on 1086 patients who have received an intravitreal GC injection and have serial IOP
measurements. Genotyping and WES will be performed as a cost efficient approach for the analyses
proposed. We will examine the GC-induced OHTN both as a quantitative trait of change in IOP adjusted for
baseline IOP and a dichotomous trait (GC responders vs. non-responders). We will execute genome-wide
association and WES analyses as well as targeted analyses. We will target variants in genes that are
transcriptionally regulated by GCs as identified in Aim 1, in loci with GREs, and in genes previously associated
with IOP or POAG. We will examine rare variants in the same loci for association with disease outcome using
aggregate and burden tests. We will enroll a replication cohort of 530 participants and perform targeted
sequencing to follow up suggestive or significant findings from the discovery analyses. We will also perform in
silico replication of these findings in three external cohorts with existing genomic data. Implications: If genes
associated with GC-induced IOP rise are identified, they will not only provide insights into this complication's
pathophysiology, but also into POAG mechanisms more broadly. Our findings will have implications for clinical
management of patients on GC. If we are able to identify patients at risk of GC-induced OHTN, we may avoid
morbidity by using alternative therapies or increasing surveillance while patients receive GC."
10755720,"HSV-1, one of nine human herpesviruses (HHVs),
has infected more than 3.7 billion people under the age of
50 (67% of the world’s population) and
is associated with recurrent cold sores, genital lesions, keratitis, corneal
blindness, encephalitis and disseminated neonatal infections. The ability of herpesviruses to establish latent
infections that undergo periodic reactivation significantly contributes to their ability to cause life-long disease,
viral shedding and transmission to new hosts, underscoring the critical need for a better understanding
of their mechanism of DNA replication. Despite the identification of seven viral proteins necessary for HSV
DNA synthesis and three origins of replication, the current understanding of the mechanism of viral DNA
replication is woefully incomplete. Although it has been known for decades that HSV replicates by concatemer
formation, the mechanism by which concatemers form has yet to be identified. Several lines of evidence suggest
that HSV promotes a unique form of DNA replication that utilizes a recombination-dependent mechanism to
produce concatemers. We have identified a two component HSV recombinase comprised of a 5’ to 3’
exonuclease (UL12) and a ssDNA annealing protein or SSAP (ICP8) (exo/SSAP). This complex is reminiscent
of the λ phage Red α/β recombinase required for recombination dependent replication in λ phage and in vivo
recombination-mediated genetic engineering (recombineering). Interestingly exo/SSAP recombinases are
conserved in most dsDNA viruses of bacteria, protozoa, plants and mammals that replicate by concatemer
formation. HSV DNA replication is further complicated by the fact that the viral genome contains nicks and gaps,
and the introduction this damaged genome is known to activate cellular DNA damage response (DDR) pathways,
some of which are antiviral. Thus, HSV has two major challenges: to produce concatemers that can be
packaged while at the same time avoiding cellular antiviral processes.
ICP8 is a central player in all stages of the DNA replication process, acting as a hub for protein-protein
interactions necessary to initiate viral DNA synthesis, bind cooperatively to ssDNA and promote single
strand annealing. In Aim 1 we will explore ICP8 interactions required for initiation of DNA replication and
cooperative binding to ssDNA. In Aim 2 we will explore the role of ICP8 and UL12 in annealing and
recombination-dependent DNA replication. We have shown that the annealing activity of ICP8 is essential for
viral DNA replication during infection, supporting the notion that HSV-1 uses recombination-dependent
mechanisms during DNA replication. In Aim 3 we will examine the role of UL12 in the manipulation of host DDR
pathways. Herpesviruses have evolved an unusual strategy to replicate their genomes that is distinct from
bacterial and cellular DNA replication mechanisms. However, the remarkable degree of conservation between
viruses that replicate through concatemers underscores the fact that these viruses have evolved an extremely
successful strategy utilizing recombination-mediated mechanisms for replication of difficult to replicate genomes."
10755722,"ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) is a cell surface metalloprotease with vital roles in
regulating the EGF-receptor as well as TNFa signaling. EGFR-ligands and TNFa are made as membrane-
anchored precursors that must be proteolytically released or “shed” to activate the soluble signaling molecule.
Mice lacking ADAM17 resemble mice lacking the EGFR, providing genetic evidence for the essential role of
ADAM17 in EGFR signaling. Moreover, inactivation of ADAM17 in myeloid cells protects from septic shock in
mice, which is caused by the release of soluble TNFa from myeloid cells. These functions establish ADAM17
as an important potential target for the treatment of EGFR- and TNFa-dependent pathologies such as cancer
and autoimmune diseases. ADAM17 activity is highly regulated and is influenced by numerous signaling
pathways. How these pathways functionally intersect with ADAM17 and how ADAM17 is activated are key
questions that are the main focus of my lab. Previously, we had found that ADAM17 is regulated by its
transmembrane domain (TMD), which ultimately led us to identify the seven-membrane spanning iRhoms1 and
2 (iR1, iR2) as novel regulators of ADAM17. We showed that iR2 controls the function of ADAM17 in immune
cells and that inactivation of iR1 and iR2 abolishes all functions of ADAM17 in mice, thereby providing
biochemical, cell biological and genetic evidence that iR1 and iR2 are the long sought-after regulators of
ADAM17. The main goals of the current proposal are to understand how iR1 and 2 integrate, interpret and
execute the signals that drive the activation of the ADAM17/EGFR- and ADAM17/TNFa signaling pathway.
 In the next 5 years, we will explore the biosynthesis and regulation of the iRhom/ADAM17 complexes and
how they target substrates in a selective manner. We know that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 is
required to stabilize the protein, most likely so that it can assembly with an iRhom in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). We would like to identify the factors that stabilize ADAM17 and the sites in ADAM17 and the iRhoms
that promote their interaction. Once the iRhoms have assembled with ADAM17, they move to the cell surface.
We will use mutant iRhoms that are retained in the ER to identify binding partners that regulate their export
from the ER. We will also explore how the substrate selectivity of iRhoms is determined at the molecular level.
Finally, ADAM17 is unique in that it responds rapidly to several different signaling pathways, a property that is
thought to be essential for its role in skin and intestinal barrier protection. We will study the molecular details of
the on/off switch for ADAM17, and generate mice that express a constitutively active ADAM17 that cannot be
activated to determine how important this unique property of ADAM17 is in vivo.
 Together, our planned studies will resolve the most pressing current questions regarding the regulation of
ADAM17, a major cellular sheddase that is critical for TNFa and EGFR signaling and a target for treatment of
cancer and autoimmune diseases, by its recently discovered upstream regulators iR1 and iR2."

 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased
mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options
to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with
CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we
have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has
been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but
there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association
with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as
several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF-
1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a
measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type
specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with
increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and
its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this
proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with
increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the
association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers
that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to
accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and
Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima
Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where
patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.
 The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA-
sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate
gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with
complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The
long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury
based on mechanistic terms."
10756148,"Inflammasome related caspases such as caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-11 are a subset of
the caspase family specialized in executing a lytic form of cell death and IL-1 cytokine-based
inflammatory response. The activation of these inflammatory caspases is strongly coupled to
innate immune detection of infections and cellular perturbations via canonical and noncanonical
inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes in the cytosol assembled in
response to wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including nucleic
acids, toxins, flagellin, and cell wall components and endogenous danger signals (danger-
associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs) such as ATP and uric acid crystals. The assembly of
inflammasome complex leads to the autoproteolytic activation of inflammatory caspases.
Enzymatically active versions of inflammatory caspases activate a pore forming protein called
gasdermin D, which lyses the cells via plasma membrane perforation. Active caspase-1 also
cleaves the inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms. Inflammatory
caspases are important for initiating the inflammatory response against a wide variety of
pathogens including bacteria and viruses. Inflammatory caspases also play crucial roles in sepsis,
a major life-threatening condition associated with infections. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
membrane-bound structures abundantly released by our living cells into the extracellular space.
EVs are packaged with proteins, lipids, and RNAs, and EVs have emerged as a crucial mode of
inter-cellular transfer of all three cargoes. EV-cargoes are functional and modulate the physiology
of the recipient cells. However, the role of EVs in the inflammasome signaling is poorly
understood. This proposal seeks to comprehensively address this critical knowledge gap in three
specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize the impact of host-derived EVs on inflammatory caspase
activation by PAMPs. Aims 2 and 3 will demonstrate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by
which the host-derived EVs regulate PAMP-activation of inflammatory caspases. In summary, this
proposal will reveal a new role for host-derived EVs in inflammasome responses in the context of
host defense with great implications for human infectious diseases and sepsis."

Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, a
neurological disorder with incapacitating episodic headaches. TRPV4 Ca++-permeable ion channels are
expressed and function in trigeminal (TG) sensory neurons, also in keratinocytes and in mast cells, which are
both innervated by TG sensory neurons, in head-face skin and meninges. My main objective is to define TRPV4
dependent mechanisms in non-neuronal cells, specifically skin keratinocytes and meningeal mast cells, and how
these can tune migraine pain-relevant trigeminal nociceptor neurons. One particular intriguing and understudied
feature of migraine and other pathologic pain is racial divergence of suffering, identified as more severe in African
Americans. An obstacle toward rational understanding is simply a lack of mechanistic studies that elucidate this
phenomenon. Based on my preliminary experiments, namely TRPV4 channels becoming UVB-sensitized more
in skin keratinocytes from African Americans than from Caucasians, I also intend to elucidate racial differences
in forefront trigeminal pain signaling that depend on TRPV4 in keratinocytes and mast cells. My central
hypothesis is that hypersensitization of TRPV4 channels in skin keratinocytes and meningeal mast cells
contributes to development and perpetuation of inflammatory pain in migraine, and that this regulation is
modulated by racial background. To test this hypothesis, I propose two aims: 1) To determine how inflammation
alters TRPV4 channel sensitization in keratinocytes and how skin pigmentation determines the channel’s
sensitivity; 2) To characterize the contribution of TRPV4 in mast cells in migraine pain. Yield from this proposal
will fill a significant gap in understanding how TRPV4 facilitates the crosstalk of keratinocytes and mast cells with
TG neurons that innervate them and contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine. Deconstructing these
processes will set the stage for regulating both mast cells’ and keratinocytes’ powerful pro-inflammatory/pro-
algesic organismal function. The proposed quest for identifiable racial differences of biologic signaling in the
interrogated cell lineages will position us to leverage these findings toward personalized medicine.
With the guidance from my team of mentors, whose expertise ranges across the pertinent areas of study relevant
for this proposal, and with whom I am already effectively collaborating, I propose to effectively train for my further
career development. I expect to: 1) Gain experience in collaborations and team formation, 2) Expand my skill-
set platform in laboratory-based techniques such as modeling animal behavior and mast cell cellular and
molecular assays, 3) Acquire and apply advance statistical analysis skills to my research, 4) Expand my
communication skills, including scientific writing and presentation, and build on my existing set of managerial
and leadership skills. The proposed training will equip me with unique a set of skills needed to become an
Independent laboratory-based investigator in multidisciplinary approaches for studying inflammatory pain."
10916490,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy despite aggressive surgery and
toxic chemotherapies. More effective and safer targeted drugs are urgently needed to address this unmet
medical need. Compared to normal tissues, EOC exhibits aberrant proteasome function that triggers
accumulation of high molecular weight polyubiqutinated and misfolded protein aggregates. Because of this
unresolved proteotoxic stress, EOC cell lines are highly susceptible to proteasome inhibitors. While highly
effective against liquid cancers like multiple myeloma, unfortunately the licensed 20S proteasome inhibitors,
such as bortezomib, have proven ineffective against solid tumors, including EOC. This reflects limited tissue
access for these peptide-based drugs and dose-limiting toxicities, notably peripheral neuropathy,
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Up284 is a proprietary upstream (19S) proteasome inhibitor with a novel
target and mechanism, RPN13 inhibition, and a structure designed to overcome the limitations of the licensed
drugs with respect to limited potency (Up284 blocks substrate recognition and deubiquitination by the 19S
rather than just one of the three 20S catalytic activities), poor activity against solid tumors (Up284 has a
novel spiro structure with improved drug-like properties compared to peptide-based 20S inhibitors, and
promotes antigen-representation by tumor cells), key toxicities of peripheral neuropathy (Not clinically
apparent with Up284 in initial murine studies) and thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (Up284 spares the
immunoproteasome and lacks these side effects). Up284 shows broad anticancer activity in vitro, including
against EOC lines selected for platinum resistance, with a robust therapeutic index and a promising safety profile,
and the ability to control xenograft tumor in an orthotopic mouse model of EOC. This promising data reflects our
extensive medicinal chemistry effort to achieve drug-like properties and a patent has been awarded in US
(pending in other countries) to cover the novel backbone and lead compounds. Murine data indicate Up284 has
favorable pharmacodynamics and confirm the novel mechanism of action in vivo. By inhibiting proteasome
ubiquitin receptor RPN13 function and its associated deubiquitinase activity, Up284 produces more rapid
accumulation of larger molecular weight polyubiquinated protein aggregates than the 20S inhibitors. These toxic
misfolded protein aggregates produce an unresolved ER stress, activate the canonical Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR) and thus Up284 more rapidly triggers p53-independent apoptosis than 20S inhibitor. To support
an IND application to FDA, we propose: Aim 1: Assessing toxicity & Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) in mice treated
IP vs IV with Up284 vs. bortezomib (months 1-3). Aim 2: Mouse clinical trial: Testing therapeutic efficacy of
Up284 delivered IP vs IV against 13 ovarian PDX models (months 3-7); Aim 3: Process development, GLP
manufacture, formulation stability & GLP bioanalytical method development of Up284 (months 7-24); Aims 4 &
5: GLP toxicology and safety studies of Up284 in rats & dogs (months 15-24)."
10757717,"Abstract
Listeners with hearing impairment can often understand spoken language, but with increased effort, taking
cognitive resources away from other processes such as attention and memory. An important challenge is
therefore to understand how the brain copes with a degraded speech signal and the cognitive processes that
are most critical to successful comprehension. Adult listeners with cochlear implants are a unique group in
which to investigate effortful listening: They have typically adapted to auditory deprivation for a period of years
of profound hearing loss, followed by some degree of hearing restoration following implantation. Following
increased auditory input due to cochlear implantation, the degree to which individual listeners are able to
successfully recognize speech, especially in the presence of background noise, is extremely variable. Previous
attempts to explain this variability in the context of underlying patterns of brain activity have been unsuccessful,
in large part because the technical challenges associated with neuroimaging in the presence of an implanted
medical device have prevented adequate localization of neural responses to speech. The goal of our research
is to understand the cognitive systems that support speech recognition in listeners with cochlear implants and
to use knowledge about these systems to improve behavioral outcomes. We do so using converging evidence
from behavioral measures and functional brain imaging. We make use of high-density diffuse optical
tomography (HD-DOT), a form of optical brain imaging that produces anatomically-localized indices of regional
cortical activity. We will map the brain networks supporting speech comprehension in listeners with cochlear
implants, which we expect to differ from those engaged by listeners with good hearing. We will then evaluate
the degree to which neural markers of effortful listening can predict individual differences in speech recognition
success in the presence of background noise. Together the findings will help ground our understanding of
cochlear implant-aided speech recognition in a neuroanatomically-constrained framework and develop more
accurate outcome measures."
10757721,"PROJECT SUMMARY - MODELING MULTISCALE IMMUNO-MECHANICS IN AORTIC DISEASE
Most vascular diseases result from, or lead to, diminished biomechanical function. Consistent with homeostatic
processes tending to oppose detrimental changes in soft tissues, many vascular diseases can be attributed to
compromised or lost homeostasis. Whereas mechanical homeostasis is well appreciated in large arteries, it has
recently been recognized that inflammation can contribute to tissue homeostasis, though also to disease initiation
and progression. There is, therefore, a need to understand together the mechano-biological and immuno-
biological control of arterial geometry, composition, properties, and function. The overall goal of this project is to
develop and test general data-informed computational models of immuno-mechanics from molecule to matrix.
Given that hypertension is a significant risk factor for diverse vascular diseases, we will illustrate the utility of our
computational model by focusing on mouse models of hypertensive aortic remodeling while examining effects of
sex within the context of immune status and age of onset of the hypertension relative to different stages of aortic
development. Early onset hypertension in children and adolescents is reaching epidemic proportions in the USA,
but is poorly understood. We will thus gather extensive data sets that will inform and validate our novel multiscale
computational models while revealing critical new understanding of aortic development and hypertensive risk.
Given the complementary roles of mechanical and inflammatory homeostasis, a key goal of pharmacotherapy
should be to support tissue homeostasis while limiting or preventing pathological processes. Thus, we will also
collect data to contrast the efficacy of reducing either the mechanical stress (anti-hypertensive) or the oxidative
stress (anti-inflammatory), or both. We hypothesize that the efficacy of a type of drug, or combination thereof,
will depend on the time of onset of hypertension, particularly given that very early onset hypertension can alter
aortic development by establishing new homeostatic states and set-points. To our knowledge this important
understanding has not yet been addressed within a rigorous experimental-theoretical framework. This work will
be founded on prior advances by our group – including consistent biomechanical phenotyping that ensures
reproducibility and fundamental new concepts such as mechanobiological stability that ensure mathematical and
biomechanical rigor – but will significantly extend these concepts to build a unique systems understanding of
immuno-mechanics. This work is significant because of the pressing need to understand better many soft tissue
diseases, particularly hypertension and its alarming increased affliction of children and adolescents (as noted by
the CDC and many others); it is innovative in its approach (modeling immuno-mechanics, delineating innate and
adaptive immunity) and focus (hypertensive remodeling as a function of age of onset, immune status, and sex)."
10757722,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a result of sudden luminal thrombosis. These pathologic events are a
significant clinical problem, not only because of their frequency, but also due to the diagnostic challenge in
stratifying risk for coronary lesions (i.e., stable versus rupture-prone) and identifying lesions that will undergo
rapid progression and increased vulnerability (i.e., lesion prognostication). Although invasive imaging modalities
can characterize plaque composition and phenotype, the use of imaging to risk stratify coronary lesions that will
precipitate an ACS event has proven less accurate. Thus, plaque risk stratification strategies should move
beyond image-based morphologic markers and focus on identifying the local environmental factor(s) that
contribute to rapid coronary artery disease (CAD) progression, heightened vulnerability, and rupture risk. The
overall goal of this R01 proposal, therefore, is to examine the predictive value of mechanical metrics for lesion
risk stratification and prognostication in prospective studies evaluating the natural history of coronary
atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that mechanical indices will advance the identification of high-risk
coronary lesions and promote the ability to predict plaque rupture. To realize this goal, we will approach this
research through two hypothesis-driven Specific Aims: (i) examine the predictive value of plaque material
stiffness in stratifying risk for coronary lesion rupture and (ii) evaluate the prognostic value of deformation-
induced wall stress for identifying rapidly progressing CAD and increased plaque vulnerability. We propose to
develop and validate computational frameworks to extract the heterogeneous material properties of coronary
arteries and predict the 3D patient-specific coronary plaque mechanical environment through forward finite
element analysis. Subsequently, these frameworks will be clinically translated to establish their clinical value.
Successful completion of the proposed research will advance understanding of the prognostic value of
mechanics in the natural history of CAD and advance patient management and treatment strategies towards
minimizing adverse events associated with ACS."
10757726,"Project Summary
Gene fusions of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase, ROS1, are expressed in a range of malignancies. My lab
and other labs have demonstrated that ROS1 gene fusions drive neoplastic transformation of cells in vitro and
are tumorigenic in vivo when concurrent with loss of tumor suppressor (TP53). It is thought that these gene
fusions transform cells via uncontrolled ROS1 kinase activity. Importantly, clinical implementation of the first-
generation ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), crizotinib, has resulted in significant reduction of
tumor burden in patients with ROS1-fusion positive tumors. However, the efficacy of crizotinib treatment is
often short-lived as resistance to the drug emerges after a period of time. Therefore, ongoing research efforts
will be required to discover second-line or combination therapeutic options.
Clinical resistance to crizotinib treatment has taken on two forms: 1) aberrations in alternate signaling
pathways that compensate for any loss in ROS1 kinase signaling (“bypass pathway aberrations”) and 2) loss of
TKI potency due to point mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain. While both forms of resistance are equivalent
in terms of incidence, little attention has been provided towards understanding bypass pathway aberrations.
Notably, a patient that our collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) are treating has
stopped responding to crizotinib therapy for ROS1-fusion positive non-small-cell lung cancer after initially
seeing tumor regression. Sequencing of the crizotinib-resistant tumor found a copy-number amplification
(CNA) in the transcription factor, MYC, that was absent in the initial tumor. I hypothesize that CNA of MYC
represents a bypass pathway aberration that has reduced the efficacy of crizotinib treatment in this patient and
that this phenomenon can occur in other tumors. To study this, I will 1) reversibly perturb MYC in cells derived
from the patient tumor to determine if ROS1-TKI sensitivity is restored and 2) overexpress MYC in a crizotinib-
sensitive, ROS1-fusion expressing human broncho-epithelial cell line to observe if ROS1-TKI resistance
appears.
Unlike bypass pathway aberrations, much research has been conducted to characterize ALK and ROS1 kinase
point mutations that confer resistance to crizotinib. This has aided the design of second-generation ALK/ROS1-
TKIs like lorlatinib that can bind to the ROS1 kinase domain even in the presence of these mutations. However,
I hypothesize that resistant point mutations will develop towards the new TKIs and that predicting them will
inform future drug design. To study this, I will perform a forward mutagenesis screen in a lorlatinib-sensitive
ROS1-fusion cell line to identify mutations in ROS1 that confer resistance to lorlatinib.
Taken together, achieving the objectives of this project will: 1) discover a bypass pathway aberration that
causes resistance to the ALK/ROS1-TKI, crizotinib, and 2) identify ROS1 point mutations that confer resistance
to a next-generation ROS1-TKI, lorlatinib. This will help combat future ROS1-TKI resistance in patients."
10757727,"The past half-century has seen an amazing trend. Linked advances in vascular biology, endovascular
intervention and drug delivery have dropped morality from cardiovascular disease 4.5 fold. NIH support has
blessed us with involvement in these endeavors and we are humbled by the accomplishments of the community.
Yet, atherosclerotic disease is not eradicated, we do not fully grasp the vascular biology of obstructive vascular
diseases, and interventional therapy is not at a standardized consensus. There is much to be learned in all areas
especially for complex lesions where lesion modification is deemed indispensable. Increasingly sophisticated
methods (e.g. orbital atherectomy, lithotripsy etc.) modify complex plaque before angioplasty or implantation of
devices like stents, and yet modifications are still guided by operator personal experience. There are no criteria
as to which technology to use and when, what constitutes sufficient modification and how to balance benefits
and risks. Intravascular imaging can help visualize lesions peri-modification, but provides no functional feedback,
forcing even experienced interventionalists to guide intricate procedures by sensation (touch, feel, even sound).
 What is needed and what our team of academic and industrial scientists, engineers and clinicians aims to
develop are mechanistic insight into the biology of modification and tools for predicting function from imaging
and validated criteria for treatment outcomes. We will relate alterations in lesion micro-morphology (calcium, lipid,
fibrous, fibro-fatty content) to changes in spatial micro-mechanical (compliance, stress) and local drug delivery
(uptake, retention) response, and correlate image-based quantification of lesion micro-morphology to
interventional outcome, providing a framework to predict and optimize, therapy.
 Our aims are to (1) Quantify changes in clinical lesion micro-morphology of complex arterial disease as a
function of lesion modification using deep-learning-based image analysis, and investigate how initial lesion state
can predict micro-morphological alterations for different modifications. (2) Use image processing and lesion-
specific inverse modelling to examine effects of lesion modification on micro-mechanics and local drug
distribution in excised human lesions, and (3) compare predictions with clinical performance after angioplasty
and stenting. Combining aims 1 and 2 with computational virtual stent implantation we will predict vascular
responses after modification of vascular morphology, and compare these predictions to outcomes from clinical
trials that have imaging and longitudinal follow-up. In whole we will distinguish clinical outcomes that arise from
optimization of lumen dimensions, from optimization of micro-morphology, -mechanics and drug distribution.
 The significance of our work lies in providing a mechanistic framework to explore increasing use of lesion
modification pre-intervention and a means to leverage such insight to guide and optimize effect. The novelty is
in using imaging and computational methods developed with the past NIH support to achieve this understanding.
We are honored that our science may have clinical impact in treating complex vascular disease."
10757319,"Project Summary
 Transcranial ultrasound could facilitate a broad variety of applications in brain imaging, e.g., functional imaging,
intracerebral hemorrhage detection, brain perfusion evaluation, and stroke diagnosis. Ultrasound has the intrinsic
advantages of being real-time, portable, widely available, noninvasive, and free from ionizing radiation. Thus,
transcranial ultrasound imaging could potentially play a unique role in a time-sensitive and dynamic environment
where X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are unavailable. For instance,
transcranial ultrasound has significant potentials in the initial assessment of traumatic brain injury during the
transportation of patients to the hospital, and in bedside monitoring of brain physiology for stroke patients in an
intensive care unit. Despite its promising potentials, the use of transcranial ultrasound imaging has been limited,
largely because adult human skulls cause severe phase aberration, leading to highly degraded ultrasound
images. Phase aberration from the skull can be accurately corrected if the speed of sound (SOS) and profile
(i.e., thickness distribution) of the skull are known a priori. The skull profile and SOS can be estimated by CT,
currently the gold standard approach for treatment planning. The CT-based approach is far less appealing,
however, for ultrasound imaging purposes because of the additional CT scans that involve ionizing radiation and
image co-registration. We propose a real-time pulse-echo ultrasound approach to estimate the skull profile and
SOS using deep learning (DL) methods with ultrasound radiofrequency (RF) signals backscattered from the skull.
The proposed approach rests on the scientific premise that these RF signals contain extremely rich information
of the interaction between ultrasound and skulls, and the information of skull profile and SOS is encoded in the
backscattered signals in a convoluted way that cannot be fully described by simple physical models. We
hypothesize that DL, a subclass of machine learning (ML), is capable of automatically and rapidly extracting skull
profile and SOS from RF signals with sufficient training. The objective of this Trailblazer R21 application is to
develop and validate DL methods for extracting the human skull profile and SOS, with the following aims. Aim 1.
In silico study: Develop and evaluate DL-based skull profile and SOS extraction algorithms using synthetic data.
Aim 2. Experimental study: Evaluate DL algorithms’ performance in skull profile and SOS extraction using
experimental data. Aim 3. Pilot imaging study: Evaluate DL algorithms’ performance in transcranial imaging.
Successful completion of this study will facilitate the transcranial application of both conventional (e.g., B-mode
imaging, blood flow imaging, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound) and emerging ultrasound imaging methods (e.g,
super-resolution imaging and photoacoustic tomography). Although the current application focuses on brain
imaging, our method can be extended to phase aberration correction for ultrasound-based brain treatment,
neuromodulation, and ultrasound imaging of other organs where phase aberration exists."
10757322,"Pancreatic cancer remains among the most lethal of solid tumors, due to late diagnosis and a high probability of
metastatic spread. Effective new systemic treatments are needed in order to improve outcomes in patients.
Targeted radionuclide therapy has demonstrated effectiveness cancer therapy, notably with the success of 177Lu-
dotatate in neuroendocrine tumors including those of the pancreas. Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is
upregulated in 60-80% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, making it a promising target for antibody-directed
therapy. An engineered antibody fragment, the A2 scFv-Fc2 DM has been specifically designed for optimized
delivery of therapeutic radionucides in pancreatic cancer. It is based on a humanized, high-affinity anti-PSCA
antibody, and contains Fc mutations engineered to foster rapid blood clearance via the hepatobiliary route. As a
result, radiation dose to key organs/tissues (bone marrow and kidney) is minimized, enabling effective delivery
of an alpha- or beta-emitting radionuclide to tumors. In Aim 1, biodistribution studies will be undertaken in mouse
models, in order to confirm the expected tumor targeting and hepatic clearance. Formal dose estimations will be
made for the scFv-Fc2 DM radiolabeled with either 177Lu or 225Ac for therapy. Aim 2 will explore the potential
efficacy of the anti-PSCA scFv-Fc2 DM in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, including subcutaneous
xenografts of human pancreatic tumor cells, a syngeneic model of KPC-PSCA tumors in huPSCA knock-in mice,
and patient-derived pancreatic tumor xenograft models. The relative efficacies and toxicities of the alpha-emitter
225Ac and beta-emitter 177Lu will be analyzed in order to prepare for future clinical therapy studies. In Aim 3,
clinical production and conjugation of the anti-PSCA scFv-Fc2 DM will be performed, testing conducted, and an
IND filed. Finally, in Aim 4 we will conduct a first-in-human imaging study using 64Cu-DOTA-anti-PSCA scFv-
Fc2 DM in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, to evaluate the targeting, and clearance properties and
potential radiation dose delivery of this novel engineered antibody fragment. Results from this clinical
immunoPET study will be central to guiding future development of a radioimmunotherapy agent that can be
implemented in a theranostic approach to pancreatic cancer."
10757324,"Methylation on histone and non-histone proteins is a common and important post-translational
modification (PTM) that controls protein functions and activities in modulating cancer tumorigenicity and
responses to therapies. In this project, we will investigate the mechanism for protein arginine (R) methylation
regulation of GBM tumorigenicity by elucidating the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) on cell
mitosis through specific arginine methylation of regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1), thereby
regulating GBM phenotype and responses to therapies. We provide novel evidence that PRMT6 regulates RCC1
activity through methylation of RCC1 at R214, the arginine residue required for RCC1 activation of Ran GTPase
through association with histones in chromosome, thereby affecting cell mitotic process, GBM tumorigenicity and
responses to therapies. We demonstrate that casein kinase 2 (CK2), a ubiquitously expressed and constitutively
active serine/threonine kinase that is important in cancers stimulates PRMT6 methyltransferase activity by
phosphorylating threonine 21 of PRMT6 protein. Additionally, genetic depletions or small molecule targeting of
PRMT6, RCC1 or CK2 inhibited GBM tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced anti-tumor effects by
radiation therapy (RT). These strong scientific premises provide the basis for the overarching hypothesis of this
proposal: CK2-activated PRMT6 induces asymmetric dimethylation (aDMA) of RCC1, thereby regulating cell
mitosis, GBM tumorigenicity as well as GBM responses to RT. We will address this hypothesis in the context of
three specific aims: 1) Determine how PRMT6-induced R214 aDMA of RCC1 affects cell mitotic process as well
as GBM tumor biologic properties in vitro and in vivo; 2) Define mechanisms by which CK2 regulates PRMT6
activity, and the relationships between CK2-associated phosphorylation of PRMT6, RCC1 function, cell mitosis,
GBM tumor phenotypes, and association with GBM patient outcome; and 3) Determine whether PRMT6 and
CK2 directed combination therapy is more effective than corresponding monotherapies, and whether such
combination therapy enhances the anti-tumor activity of RT and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. At the
completion of this project, we will learn how PRMT6-catayzed aDMA of RCC1 shapes of cell mitosis, GBM
phenotype and response to therapy. Our proposed studies will be the first to address the role of PRMT activity
on non-histone aDMA of RCC1 in cell mitosis, GBM tumor biology and responses to therapies. This knowledge,
in turn, will provide clear indication of the potential benefit of including combination of inhibition of PRMT6 and
CK2 with RT and TMZ as part of treatment strategy for patient with GBM."
10757407,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Proper localization of RNA is critical for proper RNA function, downstream protein localization, cell function,
organism development, and organism health. Of particular interest, proper sequestration of RNA into
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules helps cells respond efficiently to stress, while persistent RNA localization to
RNP granules may serve as nucleation points for proteins implicated in ALS, Alzheimer’s, and dementia. During
stress, stress granules (SGs) sequester RNA from translational machinery while processing bodies (PBs)
degrade RNA. SGs and PBs dock, or interact, in certain stress conditions and one stressor has been shown to
promote transfer of mRNA between the two RNP granules. SG-PB docking and mRNA transfer is hypothesized
to function as an additional regulatory measure during stress. mRNA transfer is hypothesized to be facilitated by
specific interactions with two RNA-binding proteins, TTP and CPEB1. However, both hypotheses remain largely
untested. In order to identify RNA localization in healthy or stressed and disease states, scientists use RNA-
imaging tools. Tools that allow us to see single molecules of RNA in live cells are of particular value since biology
is incredibly heterogenous and responds to stimuli in real time. The tool historically used to monitor mRNA
dynamics in RNP granules uses many fluorescent proteins to visualize RNA. Since RNP granules form largely
by nonspecific interactions between proteins and RNAs, this tool may compromise some of our conclusions
about the resultant data. A tool that uses small molecule fluors to visualize RNA may be better suited to
investigate this question. Riboglow was developed as a collaboration between my lab, a fluorescent tool lab, and
an RNA-biology lab. Riboglow is a live-cell RNA-imaging tool that is comprised of two main parts: an RNA
aptamer that is appended to an RNA of interest and a small-molecule fluorescent probe. Riboglow outperformed
the gold-standard tool at detecting mRNA recruitment to stress granules and preliminary data shows that
Riboglow can achieve single-molecule detection of mRNA in live cells. However, Riboglow remains a new tool.
In this proposal, I will 1) optimize and characterize Riboglow for single-molecule detection in live cells, 2) quantify
any effects that tagging an RNA with Riboglow has on basic RNA biology, 3) use Riboglow to establish a list of
stressors that cause SG-PB docking and mRNA transfer, and 4) evaluate the hypothesis that mRNA transfer is
facilitated by specific interactions with TTP and CPEB1. My research will benefit science by expanding the single-
molecule live-cell RNA-imaging toolbox for RNA biologists and by yielding foundational knowledge for the RNP
field. This will facilitate further studies on RNA localization in response to stimuli and the potential relationship
between neurodegenerative diseases and environmental stressors. This fellowship will provide me with
advanced training in biochemical tool development and optimization, quantitative fluorescence microscopy for
biological studies, and data science for image analysis. This interdisciplinary set of skills will position me to
achieve my career goals and positively impact the biomedical field."
10916498,"Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic testing (DMPK) is crucial for understanding the clearance mechanisms,
clearance rate, and any potential drug-drug interactions of small molecule drugs during lead optimization prior
to initiating in-human clinical trials. DMPK testing is currently performed using animal models, usually rats.
However, these studies are problematic for several reasons: 1) Animal-based DMPK studies are expensive and
create a large financial burden during lead optimization; the top 20 pharmaceutical companies spend >$1.2
billion each year on PK testing, with over 1 million animals used by industry per year; 2) They are time-consuming
and delay the collection of important data. For example, the synthesis of each compound needs to be scaled up
from µg to mg quantities before rat studies can be initiated. 3) While higher animal species, such as dogs, pigs,
and non-human primates, have greater human relevance, they are more expensive than rodent studies and
require synthesis of even greater quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); and 4) The ability of animal
models to predict human outcomes is controversial. Although recent attempts have been made to identify in vitro
approaches, these are all limited in terms of reliability, long-term analysis ability, reproducibility, poor reflection
of in vivo hepatic transport, clearance, and metabolism. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry needs better
approaches for DMPK testing that are more predictive, cheaper, and faster than currently available in vitro and
in vivo methods. Successful development of such a system will improve safety and help reduce the ~90% of
drug candidates that currently fail in clinical trials.
In solution to this unmet need, we propose an integrated (in vitro and in silico) hepatic clearance platform that
merges a human liver tissue chip and translational software. This technology can predict human hepatic
clearance parameters accurately in 2 weeks without the need of API scale-up. Javelin is the only organization
pursuing this technology for drug metabolism & disposition, which requires design features that are unique to
DMPK studies and that cannot be met using microphysiological systems designed for toxicology and
pharmacology applications. The purpose of this Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal is improve our technology
ready for launch by optimizing the chip design to enhance usability, evaluate drug clearance mechanisms, and
assess the clinical translation of our technology. This will be achieved through the following Aims: 1) System
design optimization; 2) Evaluation and characterization of known drug clearance mechanisms on the Javelin
hepatic clearance chip; and 3) Assessment of in vitro to in vivo translation to predict clinical outcomes. Successful
application of our tissue chip perfusion system will reduce the need for other preclinical models to estimate drug
PK outcomes, thereby reducing the risk and cost associated with drug development. Indeed, our early evidence
indicates that we can predict clinical outcomes 15% more accurately and in a manner 10-times cheaper and 10-
times faster than rat studies."
10761430,"Project Summary
 Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common sensory disability in humans in industrial countries,
affecting people of any age. The total economic cost of hearing loss, including NIHL, is more than $750 billion annually
worldwide. Currently, there is no approved medicines available for the prevention or treatment of hearing loss. Several
mechanisms – including cochlear inflammation, oxidative stress, Ca2+ overloading, and apoptosis – are important in the
pathogenesis of NIHL. Accordingly, most of preclinical or investigational drugs are antioxidants or ion channel blockers.
However, these drugs have shown either uncertain results or intolerable side effects. Thus, treatment following NIHL offers
a major biomedical challenge. The general aim of this proposed research, in collaboration with Dr. Wu (University of Texas
medical branch) and Dr. Serban (University of Montana), is to identify a novel intervention that can promote the survival
of cochlear hair cells and ribbon synapses when administrated soon after acoustic trauma. All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is
an important endogenous signaling molecule. In addition to maintaining cochlear homeostasis, RA and synthetic retinoids
greatly improves auditory function following acoustic injury, supporting our hypothesis that increasing atRA in the inner
ear will improve recovery in NIHL victims. Problematically, atRA alone has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile and
induces its own clearance, which results in decreased efficacy during long-term treatment. RA clearance is predominantly
mediated by cytochrome P450 family 26 enzymes (CYP26). We hypothesize that selective inhibition of CYP26 in the inner
ear will reduce atRA enzymatic clearance to drive up available atRA concentrations to promote the survival of cochlear hair
cells and ribbon synapses after noise-induced trauma, providing a therapeutic advantage for NIHL victim recovery. Our
approach has led to the identification of a novel selective, nanomolar CYP26 inhibitors DX308 with demonstrated efficacy
at reducing noise-induced auditory brain stem response threshold shift after systemic treatment. This novel class of
compounds is specific for CYP26A1/B1 isoforms without the off-target P450 inhibition associated with previously
described azole-based CYP26 inhibitors. The objective of this proposal is in Aim1 is to determine the minimum oral
effective dose of DX308 improving cochlear morphological and functional outcomes after noise exposure. In Aim 2, we
propose to determine cellular permeability of DX308 across the Tympanic Membrane (TM) and Round Window Membrane
(RWM) for potential topical administration. In Aim 3, we will assess the embryo-fetal development toxicity of the active
oral dose of DX308. By the end of this project, we will have identified the first-in-class oral CYP26 inhibitor preclinical
candidate which exhibits in vivo efficacy at rescuing noise-induced hearing loss, and we will have selected the route of
administration offering the most favorable balance between efficacy, toxicity and compliance for treatment of NIHL."

Glycans play crucial roles in nearly every aspect of biological processes, and their distinct properties make
them appealing as disease biomarker targets. However, due to their highly branched and variably linked
nature, glycans pose a challenge for detection, purification, and structural analysis. Although advanced
analytical techniques and instrumentation have been developed that target glycans, there is still a great need
for reagents with well-defined carbohydrate specificity and high affinity that can be used to independently
interrogate or enrich carbohydrate samples prior to traditional analyses.
Lectenz Bio has been engineering glycan-processing enzymes and glycan-binding proteins into high-affinity
glycan-specific reagents with tunable properties. The Fbs1 component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
recognizes glycans as part of its biological role in ubiquitylation. It is therefore a promising protein for
conversion into a binding reagent for asparagine-linked glycans (N-glycans), which we will achieve by
employing computational modeling and directed evolution. Initial studies demonstrate that Fbs1 can be readily
expressed in E. coli, and binds specifically to N-glycosylated peptides and proteins, and not to the
corresponding non-glycosylated peptides and proteins. However, it does demonstrate a preference for certain
N-glycan structures.
A pan-specific N-glycan binding reagent would directly address the urgent need to tools to help detect glyco-
biomarkers and could immediately benefit the field of glycomics/glycoproteomics by enabling sample pre-
enrichment. After engineering and optimizing the production of recombinant Fbs1 and its engineered variants,
Lectenz Bio will develop a suite of kits for its application in Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, ELISA,
flow cytometry, and affinity chromatography."
10932909,"Based on an analysis, the volume of dosage lost due to diversion increased from 21 million in 2017 to 47
million in 2018, a 126% increase. Addressing the drug diversion problem is a multi-faceted problem involving
many components ranging from provider training to implementation of hardware and software systems to
manage access to controlled substances. However, despite recent improvements in controlling and monitoring
access to controlled substances, the process of identifying drug diversion and ensuring compliance is
complicated and time consuming. Our overall goal is to further develop a technology based on blockchains
to track and document transportation and administration of controlled substances in a hospital environment
and detect drug diversion. The feasibility of the technology and the associated machine learning-based data
analysis engine was established in the Phase I project. Our specific aims are: 1. Further Development of a
cloud-based software platform to leverage smartphones to capture drug transactions in clinic. We will
further develop the cloud-based software platform and its associated smartphone app and web-based
dashboard developed in the Phase I project. The software platform, which uses blockchains to create an
immutable audit trail, will be further developed to capture the “cradle-to-grave” documentation of controlled
substance use and location within an ambulatory surgical center. Prior to deployment, the platform will be
tested by simulation testing using the in silico model developed in our Phase I project, which is capable of
generating realistic transaction data by using a multi-agent simulation framework. 2. Deploying the software
platform at the collaborating health system. We will perform a two-stage rollout of our software platform,
where in the first stage (the focus of this Specific Aim), we plan to perform a pilot test of our smartphone app
and the associated administrator web-based dashboard to ultimately replace the paper logs. The goal of this
stage of the rollout is to understand and address challenges of deploying a new system and potential impacts
on the workflow and its adoption. Data related to adoption, adherence to protocols, and impact on clinical
workflow will be measured and any challenges will be addressed by fine-tuning of the software platform. 3.
Further development and deployment of an analysis engine to detect drug diversion. The goal of this
specific aim is to further develop and fine-tune the analysis engine that uses data (recorded on the blockchain)
to detect drug diversion. This effort involves two main tasks. Real data (collected as part of Specific Aim 2) will
be analyzed offline by the framework developed in Phase I. Through collaboration with our collaborating health
system, we will investigate the generated red flags and use the results of such investigation to fine-tune the
parameters of our model. Next, we will integrate the updated analysis engine and rollout the drug diversion
detection capability to the pilot in collaboration with the partner health system in the second stage of the rollout."

diabetes (T2D). In these hyperglycemic conditions proteomic modifications associated with glycation and
glycoxidation are often observed. In this application we propose to analyze the role played by glycation
and carbonylation on the MHC II antigen processing and presentation machinery and its implication for T
cell immunity. Prompted by the observation that MHC II proteins, as well as processed peptides, are
modified by advanced glycation endpoint (AGE) and carbonyl groups in patients with T2D, we aim to
systematically dissect the role played by these moieties on antigen processing, MHC II-peptide binding,
DM editing, and T cell presentation. In a step-by-step approach we will address how the antigen
processing machinery is affected by glycation/carbonylation post-translational modifications (PTMs) and
how this, in turn, affects T cell immunity. In this application we propose to: (i) map glycation and
carbonylation on MHC II Molecules in T2D patients, Ob/Ob mice and relevant controls, using state-of-
the-art tandem mass spectrometry, (ii) determine the effect of these PTMs on endosomal antigen
processing using quantitative MS/MS and hot spot analysis, (iii) analyze the MHC-II
immunopeptidomes in T2D patients, Ob/Ob mice and relevant controls to determine how the
dysmetabolic environment can affect peptide selection, epitopes copy number and peptides PTM-
modifications, (iv) analyze the MHC-II immunopeptidomes in Ob/Ob mice and relevant controls, prior to
and after infection with S. Typhimurium, to determine how the dysmetabolic environment can affect MHC
II restricted pathogen immunity, (v) characterize immune responses to novel PTM-modified
autoantigens by CD4 T cell using tetramer staining following immunization with relevant epitopes, and T
cell characterization (surface phenotype, proliferation and cytokine production following antigen
stimulation). Ultimately our analysis will provide a mechanistic analysis of how T2D impacts MHC II-
restricted immune responses and its consequences on immunity."
10763380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a chronic disease characterized by lipid
retention and vascular inflammation. Endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages
are recognized to have a unique impact on the disease progression. It is recently recognized that specific
dysregulation of metabolic signaling pathways contributes to certain aspects of EC, macrophage and SMC
homeostasis. For instance, during the process of atherosclerosis, ECs are exposed to a pro-inflammatory
milieu that enhances glycolysis and reduces fatty acid oxidation in ECs and predisposes them to undergo
mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which may affect plaque stability. The implications of non-coding RNAs,
including microRNAs (miRNAs), in cardiovascular disease is well recognized, representing the most rapidly
evolving research field. Furthermore, miRNAs have emerged as critical regulators of cellular metabolism (e.g.
miR-33) and therefore can directly regulate EC metabolic responses that can determine the progression of
atherosclerosis, although this aspect has not been elucidated yet. Moreover, miRNAs can promote the
acquisition of mesenchymal markers (e.g. miR-21) that can in turn shape their metabolic response and
mesenchymal phenotype, thus affecting EC atherosclerotic phenotype. This has also not been investigated
in detail. In this regard, similar mechanisms may be involved in the phenotypic regulation of SMC during
atherosclerosis, and need to be explored as well. A vast literature has demonstrated that miRNAs play
important roles in macrophage functions by regulating macrophage inflammatory responses and
lipid metabolism. Increasing evidence indicates that a substantial crosstalk exists between innate immune
signaling and metabolic pathways. Macrophage activation and differentiation prominently feature the
modulation of genes involved in general cellular metabolic activities. In this regard, downregulation of
cholesterol biosynthetic genes in classically activated macrophages is linked to regulation of inflammatory
reactions elicited by macrophages. A critical outstanding question is how the dynamic interplay between
cholesterol, cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates and cholesterol derivatives influences macrophage foam
cell formation and inflammation, which are key determinants of atherosclerosis progression. On the whole,
this research program aims to elucidate different mechanisms that regulate cell-specific metabolic signaling
pathways and how they are involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Targeting cell-specific metabolic
processes could become another potential therapeutic targeting strategy for treating metabolic disorders."
10763435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The tooth root is a critical component of the tooth, anchored to surrounding alveolar bones through the
periodontal ligament (PDL). Appropriate formation of the root and its surrounding structure is essential not only
for fundamental functions of the tooth in mastication for nutrition intake, but also for growth and development of
the lower face. Prevalent dental diseases such as caries and periodontal diseases are the etiology for tooth
loss, which can be treated only by prostheses lacking functional structures, leading to compromised long-term
prognosis. An effective approach to regenerate a functional periodontal attachment apparatus is needed to
achieve a breakthrough in dental regenerative therapies. During tooth root formation, the dental follicle (DF)
provides precursor cells for cementoblasts, periodontal ligament (PDL) cells and alveolar cryptal bone
osteoblasts to establish the functional periodontal attachment apparatus, the periodontium. Currently, how
diverse populations of dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells work together and generate highly functional
tooth roots remains unknown. In this proposal, we will define how concerted actions of distinct classes of
dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells are essential for proper formation and regeneration of the tooth root
accompanied by a functional periodontal attachment apparatus. In Aim 1, we will define how Hedgehog-Fox
pathway regulates DF mesenchymal progenitor cells. We hypothesize that the Forkhead (Fox) transcription
factors play a key role in regulating physiological functions of Hedgehog-responsive DF mesenchymal
progenitor cells. We will first reveal the diversity of Hedgehog-responsive Gli1+ DF cells using single cell RNA-
seq analyses, and determine their relationships with PTHrP+ DF cells and other precursor cell populations.
Second, we will determine the function of Gli1+, PTHrP+ and Runx2+ cells in periodontium formation using
inducible cell ablation experiments, and further test the function of Foxf1 and Foxf2 in periodontium formation
using their floxed alleles. In Aim 2, we will identify Wnt-mediated roles of apical root mesenchymal progenitor
cells in tooth root formation. We hypothesize that chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)+ mesenchymal
progenitor cells in the apical root area orchestrate formation of the tooth root and the apical periodontium in a
canonical Wnt signaling-mediated manner. We will determine the relationship between CXCL12+ cells and
stem cells for apical papilla (SCAP) using ex vivo culture system, and define molecular mechanisms underlying
a Wnt-mediated cell fate choice of mesenchymal progenitor cells by a comparative RNA-seq analysis followed
by in situ validation. In Aim 3, we will determine actions of dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells in
periodontal regeneration. We hypothesize that distinct classes of dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells
contribute to regeneration in a concerted manner. We will define how descendants of Gli1+, PTHrP+, Runx2+
and CXCL12+ progenitor cells contribute to periodontal regeneration after bone destruction, by utilizing a
ligature-induced periodontitis model mimicking periodontal diseases, and a surgical periodontal defect model."
10747377,"A significant percentage of people in the US suffer from disabilities resulting from traumatic
injury, stroke, or degenerative disease which cause deficits in visual perception. Therefore, an
understanding of the basic circuit neurobiology and neuromodulation of feature-based visual

facilitate the development of treatments for these disabilities.
 One form of visual attention is targeted to salient features of the visual scene, during
which a subject detects optical disparities that distinguish a salient object from the cluttered
visual surroundings. The cell-circuit mechanism for how this occurs is not well understood. This
renewal project will capitalize on recent discoveries and significant experimental advantages of
the fruit fly Drosophila to explore the elementary neural circuitry required for feature-based
visual attention. The fly has a numerically simple nervous system, with which highly advanced
genetic techniques can be used to identify, manipulate, and repeatedly record the activity of
individual neurons, as well as their upstream and downstream network partners. The fly also
displays robust feature-based visual perception, even under stimulus conditions that defeat
classical models of motion vision, for which similar processes have been localized to cortical
pathways in humans and non-human primates. The PI hypothesizes that flies detect and
discriminate the higher-order features of visual objects with specialized circuits that integrate
first-order elementary motion signals retinotopically, which are further enhanced by the action of
inhibitory neurotransmitters. The PI will perform two-photon Ca2+ imaging of candidate cellular
pathways in response to stimuli the PI has discovered to elicit robust feature detection by flies
within a virtual reality flight simulator. Armed with physiological receptive fields, the PI will use
live imaging to ‘read’ and optogenetics to ‘write’ activity patterns in a behaving fly to directly
observe input-output functions of feature detection processing on visual behavior. Finally, the PI
will study how biogenic amines modulate the functional properties of feature detecting neurons
to enable plasticity required for visual feature detection in switching behavioral contexts such as
the transition from stationary quiescence to active locomotion."
10762826,"Computational Simulations of DNA Transaction Enzymes: Application and Development
Project Summary
Computational simulations based on classical molecular dynamics (MD) and hybrid quantum mechanical
(QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) methods have been shown to provide a very important tool to investigate the
reaction mechanism of enzymes with atomic level detail. Our long-term goal is to develop accurate QM/MM
methods to understand the mechanism, structure and function of enzymes involved in DNA transactions by
computational simulations. Both of these approaches have been pivotal to achieve detailed understanding of
certain aspects of DNA transaction enzymes. The accurate synthesis, maintenance, repair, and modification of
DNA is crucial for organismal survival since errors in DNA can lead to the onset of different diseases.
Therefore, enzymes related to DNA transactions need to perform their activities accurately and efficiently.
Mutations arising from exogenous or endogenous factors can result in changes that affect the structure and/or
function of these enzymes. There are a large number of enzyme families involved in the synthesis, repair and
modification of DNA. To this end, the goals of the present proposal are: 1) To improve the accuracy of
computational simulations by continuing the development of LICHEM, our QM/MM software, which interfaces
QM programs with advanced anisotropic/polarizable force fields (GEM and AMOEBA) to accurately describe
the MM environment; and to improve the sampling of QM/MM simulations using machine learning approaches
for applications with polarizable force fields. 2) To apply these techniques to understand evolutionary
convergence of function on DNA synthesis proteins; how distal mutations affect these functions and other
functions on DNA synthesis and other DNA transaction enzymes; and exploit this knowledge to develop
inhibitors that can be used as therapeutics for specific DNA polymerases and iron/2-oxoglutarate enzymes
related to DNA transactions."
10763852,"Summary
The overall goal of our study is to identify small molecule inhibitors with appropriate potency, selectivity, and
safety profiles to cure chronic toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite of animals that
causes opportunistic infections in humans. Although healthy individuals control the infection, they are not able
to completely eliminate it and remain chronically infected. Complications occur due to reactivation of chronic
infections in immunocompromised patients and new infections during pregnancy when the parasite can cross
the placental barrier and infect the developing fetus. It is estimated that ~ 2 billion people worldwide are
chronically infected with T. gondii and hence at risk of reactivation should their immune function decline.
Existing chemotherapy for T. gondii is only effective at suppressing acute infection, but is unable to eradicate
the chronic tissue-cyst stages. In preliminary studies, we have conducted a high throughput screen of a diverse
small molecule library of compounds and identified a number of very potent inhibitors (low nanomolar EC50) of
parasite growth in vitro. Additionally, several of these highly potent leads act on chronic stages of infection and
suppress reactivation of infection in an immunocompromised mouse model of toxoplasmosis. The active
compounds come from a diversity-oriented synthetic (DOS) library that was synthesized using modern
methods of asymmetric organic chemistry, hence they are rich in stereochemical diversity. The proposed
studies will focus on two series that display low nM potency in inhibiting T. gondii growth. We will develop
structure activity relationships based on T. gondii growth inhibition by existing analogs. We will then design and
synthesize new analogs to optimize potency, safety, metabolic, brain penetration, and pharmacokinetic
properties. Genetic and genomic approaches will be used to identify potential resistance and confirm
mechanisms of action of these leads. We will also employ animal models that we have developed for
monitoring the efficacy of compounds against reactivated toxoplasmosis. Successful achievement of these
goals will define leads for future clinical studies aimed at developing new drugs to eradicate chronic
toxoplasmosis."
10880265,"Abstract
This NRSA F30 fellowship will prepare the applicant for a successful career as a translational physician-
scientist. Career development training will focus on High Priority HIV/AIDS comorbidity-related research,
utilizing a preclinical rodent model of HIV gp120-induced neuropathic pain alongside investigation of a clinical
population of people living with HIV (PLWH). Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic disease associated with
excessive drinking and is frequently comorbid in people living with HIV (PLWH). AUD often results in the
emergence of negative emotional states that influence the desire to consume alcohol, and one potentially
important contributor to these negative affective states in PLWH is HIV-associated painful neuropathies (HIV-
N). Thus, the rationale for drinking in PLWH may stem from a desire for self-medication of pain due to the
analgesic properties of alcohol. Importantly, excessive alcohol use can also result in hyperalgesia, a condition
that may be worsened by HIV-N. Previous work has described the emergence of hyperalgesia in animals made
dependent on alcohol. Preliminary investigation in a cohort of PLWH has also revealed positive associations
between AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) scores and circulating levels of the stress hormone
cortisol. At the molecular level, the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) is directly controlled
via phosphorylation status. Dysregulation of GR signaling may facilitate the transition to AUD and contribute to
AUD-associated hyperalgesia, potentially playing a role in development of HIV-N. Furthermore, chronic pain
can result in supraspinal plasticity in brain areas linking nociception and negative emotion, such as the
cingulate cortex, which may also contribute to the establishment or progression of AUD. In support of this,
preliminary data has discovered increases in GR phosphorylation in the cingulate of alcohol-dependent rats.
To study the contributions of alcohol and HIV to HIV-N, we’ve utilized an established preclinical rodent model
employing perineural exposure to the HIV envelope protein, glycoprotein 120 (gp120), which is closely involved
in the pathogenesis of HIV-N. Taken together, our preliminary data and the existing literature support the
hypothesis that increased pain associated with HIV and at-risk alcohol use is driven by heightened
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity. The proposed study will employ a wide array of techniques to test two
hypotheses: (1) GR activity mediates hyperalgesia associated with HIV gp120 and alcohol dependence in rats
and (2) circulating cortisol levels are associated with pain symptoms and AUD risk measures in PLWH.
Findings from this study will advance our understanding of the role of stress hormone signaling in the interplay
between HIV- and alcohol-associated pain. With the support of a strong mentoring team and the NIH P60
Comprehensive Alcohol-HIV/AIDS Research Center (CARC), completion of the proposed research and training
plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career in academic medicine."
10889969,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sexual minority men (SMM; i.e., non-heterosexual men) in the US are impacted by intertwining epidemics of HIV
and stimulant use (e.g., methamphetamine, powder cocaine, crack cocaine) at disparate rates compared to their
heterosexual peers. Findings from our team and others demonstrate that SMM with HIV who use stimulants
have greater difficulties successfully navigating the HIV care continuum as well as display substantially elevated
viral load, amplified HIV transmission risk, and faster clinical HIV progression. The dominant theory used to
explain health disparities among SMM is minority stress theory, which states that these disparities are the result
of stigma-related social stressors (e.g., discrimination, internalized homonegativity). While evidence of the
association between minority stress and stimulant use exists, few studies have directly examined associations
between minority stress and biological HIV outcomes, such as viral load, and many rely solely on self-report
measures (as opposed to laboratory testing) to assess these outcomes. The Biopsychosocial Minority Stress
Framework (BMSF) has been proposed to link minority stress to biological health, and posits that: (a) minority
stress directly affects the health behaviors and psychological health of SMM; (b) SMM’s health behaviors and
psychological health indicators are interrelated; and (c) these factors influence biological health among SMM via
the immune system. Applying the BMSF to SMM with HIV, stimulant use and ART nonadherence (health
behaviors) may serve as mediators through which minority stress impacts viral load (an outcome critical to
immune health) and, thereby, other health outcomes (e.g., opportunistic infections and cancers). Further,
consistent with intersectionality theory, racial/ethnic minority SMM may experience intensified effects of minority
stress that could contribute to the increased burden of HIV and stimulant use observed among SMM of color in
the US. Understanding the mechanisms through which minority stress impacts viral load, and thereby other
health outcomes, has important implications for intervention among SMM with HIV who use stimulants. As such,
we propose to systematically test associations posited by the BMSF in this high-priority population using a series
of mediation analyses. Specifically, we aim to examine BMSF components by testing longitudinal associations
between minority stress, stimulant use, ART nonadherence, and laboratory testing-derived viral load using
existing data from two independent samples of SMM with HIV who use stimulants: (1) 110 SMM residing in San
Francisco, CA and (2) 350 SMM recruited from across the US. Further, we aim to test whether the associations
between minority stress, stimulant use, ART nonadherence, and viral load differ among racial/ethnic minority
versus majority (i.e., non-Hispanic White) SMM with HIV who use stimulants, using multigroup analyses to
assess the invariance of effects examined in Aims 1 and 2. Support for this project will greatly help in furthering
the PI toward his long-term goal of becoming an independent academic clinical psychologist with expertise in
studying the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying sexual and gender minority health disparities."

While Black persons account for approximately 14.6% of the US population, among those with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) 35% are Black. Treatment options include dialysis, but best outcomes (survival, quality of life,
cost) are achieved with kidney transplantation. Yet, Black ESRD patients are less likely referred for kidney
transplant evaluation - a national mandate for those with ESRD - less likely listed for kidney transplantation,
less likely to receive a kidney transplantation. As outlined by the FOA (RFA-DK-22-014), structural racism is a
fundamental cause of the stark racial disparity in health outcomes for Black patients with ESRD in the US.
Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the US and serves as an excellent example of structurally
racist communities that have disinvested in Black communities with a mean life-expectancy that is almost 30
years lower than that of affluent predominantly White Chicago neighborhoods. To counteract these severe
forces of structural racism, Dr. Simpson, engaged with the Black community to build and name the first and
largest African American Transplant Access Program {AATAP) in the nation and has enjoyed national
prominence. AATAP is a multi-pronged intervention with 4 pillars: 1. Cultural Congruency, 2. Trust/Activation,
3. Health Literacy, and 4. Psychosocial Support taking a 'Keeping it RE.A.LL.' (Racial concordance between
provider and patient, Empathy, Affirmation, Length of visit and Lay person language) approach.
Aim 1. To study the impact of African American Transplant Access Program (AATAP) designed to
mitigate structural racism and reduce health inequities for Black ESRD patients
Aim 1.1. To assess the impact of AATAP on patients' perception of health-related quality of life, social support,
patient activation, self-efficacy, knowledge about kidney transplant and perception about discrimination
Aim 1.2. To assess impact of AATAP on process measure {e.g., time to listing, completion of work-up, listing)
Aim 1.3. To assess impact of community engagement and dissemination of information aboutAATAP on
referral for kidney transplant
Aim 2: To increase awareness and structural competency among transplant gatekeepers at 2 large
kidney transplant centers
Aim 2.1. To study the experience of Black patients, providers, and team members in terms of perception of
discrimination within the transplant health system through qualitative interviews
Aim 2.2. To perform recurrent implicit bias and structural competency training
Aim 2.3. To assess perceived discrimination of Black patients over time
Aim 3: To demonstrate generalizability by adapting the AATAP program to a second large kidney
transplant program in Tampa Florida"
10892259,"Safety net newborn intensive care units (snNICUs) have been identified as contributors to the stark disparities
in care and outcomes delivered to the 60,000 very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500g) infants born annually in the
United States. Usual explanations for these findings highlight social risk and limited hospital resources as key
drivers. However, in our population-based California cohort of NICUs, we find large variation in performance
across safety net NICUs. For example, in a key national quality metric, any breast milk feeding at discharge,
which exhibits the largest racial ethnic disparities, California snNICUs as a group perform worse that non-safety
net NICUs. However, some snNICUs are among the state’s best performers (positive deviants), even after risk
adjustment. There is a dearth of knowledge regarding the malleable organizational features differentiating quality
of care across snNICUs. We propose to bridge this gap by gaining a deep understanding of network
characteristics and their links to clinical care and outcomes. We will accomplish this by leveraging the unique
population-based data resources and applied quality improvement expertise of the California Perinatal Quality
Care Collaborative (CPQCC) to conduct a novel improvement collaborative among snNICUs to address
performance and disparities in breast milk feeding rates at discharge for VLBW infants. This collaborative will
serve to create an unprecedented peer learning network of snNICUs and serve as a vehicle for our team for a
multimodal inquest to study the organizational features that either promote or degrade quality of care. We
propose a large, population-scale study of snNICUs, with a large estimated sample of approximately 5,300
VLBW infants receiving care in 30 NICUs between 2024 to 2026. Specific aims:
1. Conduct a quality improvement collaborative of safety net NICUs,
2. Identify organizational features that may be associated with quality of care delivery, and
3. Associate safety net NICU organizational features with clinical outcomes.
Our analyses will be guided by quality and implementation frameworks. Methods will include an Institute of
Healthcare Improvement style quality improvement collaborative, quantitative validated surveys of safety culture
and healthcare worker well-being, key informant interviews, and guided site visits. We will link organizational
features with clinical quality of care and outcome metrics using epidemiological causal and observational
modeling approaches. We have a long track record of impactful research funded by NIH using CPQCC data. We
expect our research to have an immediate positive impact; internally, it is designed to build quality and safety
capacity in snNICUs that can readily be extended to other aspects of care; externally, it will result in actionable
information for policy makers, administrators and clinicians to improve perinatal care delivery and equity. The
topic is timely, the sample (~90% of all CA snNICUs) is unique, the research team is accomplished, and the
focus on an outcome of high importance to snNICUs, and to public health are significant strengths of this study."
10749952,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glucose is an essential fuel for cancer cell proliferation in serving both as a substrate for ATP production and
as an irreplaceable carbon source for biomass accumulation. Cancer cells are especially addicted to glucose
but only to secrete the majority as lactate (known as aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect), thereby creating an
inhospitable glucose-poor and lactate-rich microenvironment that would otherwise be lethal to most cells.
However, cancer cells can efficiently use the limiting glucose and excess lactate for unlimited growth through
unclear mechanisms. My preliminary data revealed that in low glucose conditions, extracellular lactate
enhances cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistically, I found that lactate preferentially enters the mitochondria
TCA cycle over glucose to increase oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, which in turn suppresses
glycolysis to conserve extracellular glucose, suggesting cancer cells rely on lactate-induced OXPHOS for
optimal growth. The proposed studies are aimed at mechanistically dissecting the metabolic interplay between
lactate-mediated mitochondrial OXPHOS and glycolysis (Aim 1 & 3), and assessing therapeutic potential of
targeting lactate oxidation in cancer (Aim 2). The following specific aims are being pursued: Aim 1. Determine
how lactate-mediated increase in OXPHOS suppress glycolysis; Aim 2. Assess the in vivo therapeutic
potential of targeting lactate oxidation using Phenformin; Aim 3. Mechanistically dissect how cells distinguish
and preferentially use extracellular lactate over glucose for entry into TCA cycle. The knowledge and scientific
expertise gained through these studies will facilitate my transition to independence, with my long-term goal to
study and target metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer as a physician scientist.
In addition to the scientific goals, I have also outlined a detailed career development plan in this application to
obtain skills that are necessary for leading an independent research laboratory. The proposed research and
training plan will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Craig Thompson. Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, along with the nearby Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medical College will provide the
ideal academic environment to achieve these goals for me to transition to independence."
10762478,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy that has a very poor prognosis in the United States. It has a 5-
year survival rate of only 9% and is projected to become the second most common cancer death by 2030.
Pancreatic cancer also has a disproportionate burden across race/ethnicity, with higher incidence rates observed
among minority groups, such African Americans, Japanese Americans, and Native Hawaiians. Past prediction
models have been developed to identify high-risk individuals and improve the earlier detection of this disease.
However, these models were designed in individuals of primarily European or Asian ancestry and have not been
validated in multiethnic populations. In addition, these models included mainly known epidemiologic risk factors
and only a few incorporated data on genetic variants or health conditions. Thus, a model that employs more
granular data, such as comorbidities/symptoms, genomics and metabolomics, for the prediction of pancreatic
cancer across multiple races/ethnicities does not exist. In this study, we seek to apply an integrative systems
biology approach to enhance the prediction of pancreatic cancer risk using data from the Multiethnic Cohort
(MEC) Study. The MEC is a long-standing prospective cohort of over 215,000 racially diverse individuals that
has comprehensive lifestyle, environmental, clinical, and genetic data. We will use data from existing resources
of the MEC, including epidemiologic risk factors from questionnaires, clinical health conditions from Medicare
claims, genetic data from a large biorepository of blood samples, and cancer incidence and mortality information
from SEER Cancer registries and state and national mortality databases. We will also generate new metabolomic
data for a subset of MEC participants. Our specific aims are: 1) to identify clusters or patterns of clinical conditions
associated with pancreatic cancer risk; 2) to validate existing prediction models in a multiethnic population and
develop an enhanced prediction model that incorporates epidemiologic, clinical and genomic data; 3) to identify
metabolites associated with pancreatic cancer in a multiethnic population; and 4) to integrate epidemiologic,
clinical, genomic and metabolomic data to identify individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer. Results from this
study are expected to elucidate etiologic mechanisms and improve the prediction of pancreatic cancer risk for
heterogeneous populations. This will have significant implications for improving strategies for earlier detection
and reducing the overwhelming burden of this fatal cancer."
10928268,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct the first mechanistic clinical trial of pediatric Comprehensive
Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) to identify bio-behavioral predictors and correlates of response and the
most potent aspects of CBIT delivery. Chronic tics affect 1-3% of youth in the US and are a disabling
neuropsychiatric symptom associated with multiple childhood-onset mental disorders. CBIT is the current
first-line, gold-standard treatment for tics and focuses on skills to enhance voluntary tic suppression and
reduce tic triggers. However, about 50% of youth do not benefit from CBIT. The current study aims to use
multimodal measurements to identify predictors of response (for whom does CBIT work?), the therapeutic
processes that activate change (what are the potent aspects of CBIT delivery?), and correlates of response
(what changes occur in patients whose tics improve?). Study hypotheses, based on the literature and our
preliminary data, predict that CBIT relies upon, engages, and strengthens connectivity within and between
functional brain networks that support top-down control over motor functions. Youth ages 10-17 years with
chronic tics (N = 100) will complete a course of 8 outpatient, weekly sessions of CBIT and pre-, post-, and
3-month follow up assessments. Multimodal assessments will include: 1) neural measures of functional
connectivity among the brain's large-scale functional networks using fMRI and EEG during rest and tic
expression and suppression, 2) direct-observation behavioral measurement of tics, and 3) psychosocial
measures, including assessments of clinical symptoms and patient-centered outcome measures informed by
preliminary data and our Patient Advisory Board. CBIT process will be assessed via a novel video-based
behavioral coding of CBIT sessions. This project has the potential to directly benefit patients both immediately
and in the long-term. Results will have a downstream impact on clinical practice by informing individualized
treatment planning and efforts to streamline and improve CBIT quality. Results will also have an upstream
impact on treatment development by identifying novel neural targets for intervention and strategies for
improving CBIT outcomes via refinement or adjunctive procedures."
10745279,"Up to 20% of all individuals in the US are treated for an autoimmune and/or chronic inflammatory disease.
Autoimmune diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are responsible
for significant suffering and represent an enormous financial burden to the health care system. Despite the
release of new therapies, many individuals remain refractory to treatment. Thus, there is still a very large unmet
need to develop new medicines that can be used to treat autoimmune patients. Although we know that B cells,
B lineage antibody (Ab) secreting cells (ASCs) and inflammatory cytokines all play important roles in driving
clinical disease, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how acute or chronic inflammatory signals initiate
commitment of B cells into the ASC lineage and whether B cells contribute to pathology only through their
production of Abs or whether inflammatory effector B cells also contribute to immunity or immunopathology. We
identified a unique population of circulating T-bethi pre-ASCs (DN2 cells) that are expanded in a subset of SLE
and RA patients. We showed that these cells, which have also been observed in other autoimmune and chronic
inflammatory settings, are associated with increased systemic inflammatory cytokines, pathogenic autoAbs and
disease severity. We identified the inflammatory cytokine IFNg as key inducer of the T-bethi pre-ASC subset. We
further showed that IFNg signals significantly enhance development of both mouse and human ASCs and
determined that two IFNg-induced transcription factors (TFs), T-bet and IRF1, play important but distinct roles in
IFNg-induced ASC development. In this application we are testing our central hypothesis that IFNg induces two
mutually exclusive or competing cell fate programs in B cells – a cytokine-producing effector cell fate and an
ASC differentiation fate – and that integration of signals from TLRs and other cytokines, like IL-2, cooperate with
T-bet to repress the inflammatory fate and promote IRF1-mediated differentiation into ASCs. The immediate
objectives of this proposal are to (i) determine how IFNg signals synergize with TLR, IL-2 and IL-21 to promote
human ASC development and (ii) determine whether the balance between IRF1 and T-bet regulates the
development of protective or damaging immune B cell mediated humoral and inflammatory responses in the
setting of viral infection and autoimmunity. Our long-term goal is to use what we learn about how B cell fate
decisions are programmed to identify interventions that can be that can prevent the formation, maintenance or
function of potentially pathogenic B cell subsets. This research is significant because we will for the first time
define at a molecular level how IFNg contributes to human B cell fate decisions and how two of the TFs induced
by IFNg, T-bet and IRF1, cooperate to facilitate ASC development in the settings of acute infectious and chronic
autoimmune disease. We expect that these studies, which are designed to reveal how IFNg-induced TFs
modulate B cell fate decisions, may someday lead to new strategies for treatment of diseases, like SLE and RA,
that are caused or exacerbated by inflammatory cytokines and pathogenic Abs.

While there are many treatment options for patients with metastatic RCC, it is still a deadly disease with
considerable mortality. RCC can be much more effectively treated if it is detected early when it is amenable to
surgery. To date there is no biomarker for RCC. Additionally, A specific and sensitive circulating biomarker
could not only help detect this cancer earlier but could also aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease.
This proposal seeks to test the utility of circulating kidney injury molecule-1/ T cell immunoglobulin mucin
domain-1 (KIM-1/ TIM-1) as a blood test that can be used to follow patients with small renal masses and with
the goal of safely avoiding or delaying surgery. We will also measure KIM1 in patients with resected RCC with
the goal of identifying a high-risk patient population most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy after
nephrectomy for localized disease. This proposal will also test KIM-1 as a blood test that can help
follow response to therapy for metastatic disease. To prepare for submission our team has spent
considerable time and effort in identifying readily available patient samples to answer our questions. In
this proposal we are poised and have samples available to address all of these questions. We hope that in
the future, prospective trials will test KIM-1 in these settings but at this time, rigorous testing in these

toxicologist Dr. Kevin Osterhoudt will design a lead poisoning toolkit and lead chelation and environmental
health telehealth resource for regional clinicians. The Translational Core also aims to accelerate the reach of
CEH knowledge to children and parents through teachers in the Philadelphia region by helping them build
curricula on CEH topics. We will create a webinar series for childcare providers on CEH topics. The Translational
Core will engage vulnerable populations in the Philadelphia Region to disseminate and implement proven
environmental health translational programs such as the Community Asthma Prevention Program that will be
replicated in Chester, PA by CHOP Pulmonologist Dr. Tyra Bryant Stephens. Dr. Marilyn Howarth plans to
engage with Clean Water Action to enhance home lead evaluations to include water testing for lead through an
existing inspection process through the Energy Coordinating Agency and the Region 3 Pediatric Environmental
Health Specialty Unit to engage refugee populations around lead exposure. The Translation Core will provide
assistance to regulators, legislators and community groups by bringing science to enhance policy development.
Two examples of policy improvements would be the establishment of lead safe certification for all childcare
facilities in the state and the addition of science guidance to the risk assessment of air toxics currently underway
at Philadelphia Air Management. Dr. Marilyn Howarth will work with community partners and provide research
and data to support these initiatives. The Translational Core aims to apply children's environmental health
science to address health issues that can be applied to other regions by engaging with the Philadelphia Healthy
Schools Initiative to use a risk assessment approach to the prioritization of asbestos removal in schools,
communicating risk to parents, teachers and staff using a science-based approach. We also plan to engage
adolescents in programming that will teach them about endocrine disrupting chemicals and their health effects.
We will support pilot projects that will test, implement, adapt and evaluate new CEH research translation products
and incorporate them into existing or new programs. We will engage new researchers in children's environmental
health translational techniques in regulatory, legislative and community settings to enhance their skills in
engaging with these important translational audiences."

The most recent reports indicate Clostridioides difficile is the cause of over 400,000 cases of
gastrointestinal illness and nearly 30,000 deaths annually. A major factor in the virulence of C.
difficile is TcdB, an intracellular bacterial toxin that glucosylates small GTPases in targeted cells.
Our studies focus on determining the critical differences in TcdB1 and TcdB2, the two major
variants of TcdB. TcdB1 is produced by historical strains of C. difficile and TcdB2 is produced by
hypervirulent/epidemic strains of C. difficile. Understanding how these two forms of TcdB, which
share 92% identity, differ in critical steps in intoxication and immunogenicity provides insight into
underlying differences in virulence between historical and epidemic strains of C. difficile. Several
studies, including many from our group, have found that TcdB1 and TcdB2 differ in their
interactions with target cells, tropism, cytotoxicity, and immunogenicity. The objective of our work
is to identify and characterize the underlying molecular and cellular details of the factors
accounting for these differences in TcdB1 and TcdB2 activity. To continue this line of
investigation, three specific aims to i) Determine the underlying differences in the molecular
mechanism of TcdB1 and TcdB2 receptor binding and cell penetration, ii) Determine if TcdB2
subverts antigen presentation and limits humoral immunity to co-administered vaccine antigen
TcdB2Δ1769-1787, and iii) Construct and test strains of C. difficile expressing mutants of TcdB1
and TcdB2 will be pursued. These studies will provide further insight into the differences in TcdB1
and TcdB2, determine the contribution of TcdB to ineffective immune memory leading to relapse,
and test hypotheses related to specific TcdB functional activities in the context of C. difficile
infection. Overall, the findings from this work will enhance our understanding of C. difficile disease
at multiple levels and provide information needed to prevent and treat this serious human illness."
10931699,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) remains the most lethal gynecologic cancer in the United States. Early
detection through screening, particularly of high-risk populations, is an appealing strategy for timely
intervention yet conventional efforts have not improved survival. Extracellular vesicles (EVs; 30-200
nm in diameter) are actively released by cells into circulation, carrying diverse molecular cargo.
Capturing this information could provide a real-time window to monitor tumor burden and dynamic
molecular changes and potentially OvCa precursor lesions. We aim to advance our translational EV
assay for early OvCa diagnosis with a focus on its most lethal subtype, high-grade serous ovarian
cancer (HGSOC). We formed a powerful strategic academic-industry alliance between
Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Exosome Diagnostics and
have laid out two primary objectives. Technology reﬁnement. We will implement an automated and
high-throughput platform, OCEANA (Ovarian Cancer Exosomal Analysis with Nanoplasmonic Array).
We will also construct an EV marker panel to enhance the diagnostic power of EV assays. Expanded
clinical validation. We will rigorously evaluate OCEANA and EV biomarkers using patient-derived
organoids and samples across the clinical spectrum (e.g., benign, early, advanced stages) from a
world-class and gynecologic-focused biorepository. We have four Speciﬁc Aims to achieve these
objectives. Aim 1. We will develop a disk-based cartridge for fast, automated total EV isolation. The
underlying technology will be our dual-mode chromatography (DMC) which has demonstrated
superior EV extraction from plasma. Aim 2. We will establish an expanded EV-marker panel for
HGSOC detection informed by patient-derived organoids and EVs. Speciﬁcally, EV protein and mRNA
results will be combined to make a multi-analyte marker panel. Aim 3. We will analyze EVs from mice
hosting HGSOC patient-derived xenografts to study the relationship between tumor progression and
circulating EVs. Aim 4. We will screen circulating EVs in women with benign or malignant ovarian
conditions, rigorously evaluating OCEANA's clinical performance. Impact. This project will establish
OCEANA as a transformative tool for comprehensive EV analyses. The clinical study will also validate
EVs as a potent circulating biomarker for early detection of HGSOC. Ultimately, we envision
translating the technology as a monitoring tool for cancer care across research and clinical settings."
10875552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infant health and neurodevelopment in early life may be impaired by a wide range of prenatal and postnatal
factors including maternal infection and inflammation, and the socio-behavioral postnatal environment.
Identifying the independent impact of these exposures is critical for defining key interventions to improve infant
health and development. This proposal addresses a long-standing challenge in examining multifactorial
outcomes such as neurocognitive development that require incorporating both biological and psychosocial
exposures. The Principal Investigator, Dr. Andrea Buchwald, is an infectious disease epidemiologist at
University of Maryland School of Medicine with expertise in biostatistical methods and global health. She will
use multidisciplinary methodology to address this challenge, examining the independent contributions of
prenatal and postnatal exposures on child health and development in a cohort including HIV exposed and
uninfected infants. Using data from an on-going cohort study in Malawi, Dr. Buchwald will be uniquely able to
develop an innovative statistical approach to examine the contribution of both biological and socio-behavioral
factors on infant health and development. Mothers with and without HIV infection were enrolled in their second
trimester of pregnancy and infants are being followed up through five years of age for health and development
outcomes. Dr. Buchwald will use a multidisciplinary approach, combining machine learning and structural
equation modeling, to address the following aims:
Aim 1: Estimate the independent contributions of in utero exposure to HIV and postnatal environmental factors
on infant health and neurocognitive development.
Aim 2: Identify immunological profiles at birth predictive of infant health and neurocognitive development.
The results of this research will help us to identify key intervention targets for improving child health and
development, to inform intervention design and implementation.
 Dr. Buchwald’s goal is to become an independent investigator in in pediatric infectious disease, with
expertise in utilizing cross-disciplinary methodology to address the multifactorial nature of infectious disease.
Towards this goal, she proposes a comprehensive career development plan that will enhance her existing
skills in infectious disease epidemiology while providing mentored training in 1) data integration of large
datasets, 2) socio-behavioral methodology, 3) analyzing large biological datasets, and 4) leadership skills.
 Dr. Buchwald has assembled a highly accomplished multidisciplinary team of mentors with unique
areas of expertise including global health research, maternal/child health, neonatal immunology,
bioinformatics, structural equation modeling, and neurodevelopment. Her mentors have a track record of
successfully mentoring trainees and junior faculty and the University of Maryland School of Medicine will
provide the ideal environment for Dr. Buchwald to establish a productive independent research career."
10764106,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In our continued efforts to probe pituitary hormone action on body composition [Nature, 2017, PMID:
28538730; PNAS, 2019, PMID: 31843930]1,2 and given that weight gain in post–menopausal women is
accompanied by variable increases in FSH and LH3-7, we examined the action of LH on body fat and energy
homeostasis. We found that LH receptor (LHCGR) activation resulted in leanness—opposite to the pro–
obesity effects of FSH1. This is particularly telling as a subset of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome,
with high LH levels, display a lean phenotype8-10. We made three sets of key observations. First, we found
that LHCGR transcript and protein was expressed abundantly in fat tissue, with gonadal white adipose tissue
levels in female mice approaching that of the ovaries themselves. Second, LHCGR activation by LH, hCG and
a small molecule agonist, ORG43553, which has undergone clinical testing for infertility11-14, resulted in less fat
accrual in mice on a high–fat diet independently of testosterone. Third and importantly, ORG43553 reduced
adipocyte differentiation in organoid cultures and induced thermogenesis both in vitro (Seahorse) and in vivo
(indirect calorimetry). These responses mimicked those of FSH blockade1—raising an important clinical
question whether ORG43553 and MS-Hu6 can be used in combination for therapeutic synergy in obesity—a
crippling disease that affects 600 million men and women worldwide, with an increasing prevalence in older
adults. It is thus imperative that we understand the cellular and molecular underpinnings of LH action on
body fat, and the interactions between LH and FSH. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine how LH induces
leanness given that, not only do we find abundant receptors on adipocytes, but that LHCGRs are expressed in
hypothalamic neurons that regulate adipose tissue sympathetic tone [eLife, 2022, PMID: 36052994]15. We will
therefore delete Lhcgr selectively in adipocytes by crossing Lhcgrfl/fl mice with doxycycline–inducible Adipoq-
CrertTA,tetO mice, and use UCP1–reporter ThermoMice to study LH–induced beiging. In parallel, we will inject
siLhcgr stereotactically into LHCGR–rich hypothalamic nuclei15. Mutant mice will be put on a high–diet and
undergo detailed body composition and metabolic phenotyping. In Specific Aim 2, to determine whether FSH
and LH intersect, we will probe downstream thermogenesis and cell differentiation signals using UCP1–
reporter ThermoCells and 3T3.L1 organoids, respectively. This will be complemented by an unbiased search
for early and late events using phosphoproteomics and RNA sequencing. We will also determine which gene
has a dominant role by studying genetic epistasis between Fshr+/- and Lhcgr+/- crosses. This, in turn, will
inform us whether LHCGR agonism and FSHR blockade could be combined for treating obesity. To determine
if there is synergy, we will first perform dosing studies to determine the minimum effective dose for ORG43553,
and then combine it with the minimum effective dose of MS-Hu6 (from Project 1). All studies will be conducted
using our GLP Platform to enable inclusion of the data in our Investigational New Drug Application."
10764107,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This project builds upon data from our current U19 AG060917 that (a) show a strong correlation between
high serum FSH, low bone mineral density (BMD), and high fracture risk in older post-menopausal women in the
AGES-Reykjavik cohort, and (b) provide compelling evidence for a direct effect of FSH in causing cognitive
decline in mice [JCEM, 2021, PMID: 33326040; Nature, 2022, PMID: 28538730]1, 2. Dementia and fracture are
both highly prevalent among older adults and have devastating consequences. Hip fracture risk is higher in
older adults with dementia, and those who sustain a hip fracture have a nearly 6-fold higher six-month mortality
if cognitively impaired3, 4. There is evolving evidence that dementia and osteoporosis do not simply coexist,
but instead may be related causally––there may be “common causes” of cognitive decline and bone loss
during aging. Declining estrogen is associated with both cognitive decline and bone loss, although the effect on
cognition of replacing estrogen remains uncertain
5-9
. FSH is a compelling candidate for a “common cause” as
rising FSH levels during the menopausal transition, when estrogen is unperturbed, track with a rapid rate of bone
loss and spikes of cognitive decline10-12. AGES-Reykjavik presents a unique opportunity to understand brain-
bone connectivity in aging, as its 5,764 Icelandic participants (66-90 years at baseline, 58% female) have
undergone extensive phenotyping including cognitive testing, dementia ascertainment, brain MRI, and bone CT.
Measurements were repeated after 5 years in 3,316 participants, and incident fractures and dementia were
ascertained for years after. Given that FSH negatively affects both bone and brain2, 13 and the strong relationship
between serum FSH, BMD and fracture risk in post-menopausal women in AGES-Reykjavik1, we hypothesize
that FSH links deteriorating brain and bone health in older adults. We will use a two-pronged strategy to
determine (a) relationships between bone and brain health, and (b) whether FSH is the common cause. In
Specific Aim 1, we will examine, in a longitudinal study, whether cognitive function and MRI measures of brain
health are associated with subsequent bone loss and fracture. We expect that older adults with poor cognition
at baseline, or with global brain atrophy or infarct, will display greater bone loss. We further expect that
deteriorating cognitive function or MRI features over 5 years will predict incident fracture. In Specific Aim 2, we
will use a case-cohort design to test the hypothesis that higher serum FSH levels are associated with incident
dementia and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), independent of sex steroids. During the current U19,
we measured serum FSH, sex steroids, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) on baseline samples from a
random sub-cohort in AGES-Reykjavik, and we will now add serum levels on archived samples from cases with
incident dementia and with incident MCI. The study should help shape evidence-based recommendations on
prevention, screening and management of cognitive deficits and bone loss in older adults, and provide a firm
foundation for testing FSH-blocking drugs to promote healthy aging."
10763836,"Project summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the function and regulation of cGMP-phosphodiesterases (PDE6) in rod and
cone photoreceptor cells. As a central effector enzyme in the phototransduction cascade,
PDE6 is critical to photoreceptor cell physiology and survival. Severe retinal diseases
including retinitis pigmentosa, achromatopsia, and Leber congenital amaurosis result from
pathogenic mutations in genes that encode PDE6 subunits or aryl hydrocarbon receptor-
interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1), a specialized PDE6 chaperone. Despite our advanced
understanding of the PDE6 regulation in phototransduction, little is known about the folding
and maturation of this enzyme, and the proposed research aims to fill this gap. Our
evidence suggests that AIPL1 forms a complex with ubiquitous chaperone HSP90 that is
absolutely required for maturation of PDE6 into a functional enzyme. We will define the
protein-protein interfaces and the structure of the HSP90/AIPL1 complex in solution to
gain mechanistic insights into how this chaperone complex interacts with PDE6. Based on
our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that nascent PDE6 assumes a closed
nonfunctional state, and the HSP90/AIPL1 complex and the regulatory P-subunit of PDE6
induce and/or catalyze the transition of PDE6 from the closed state to the functional open
state via an intermediate state. We propose a detailed model as to how HSP90, AIPL1
and P facilitate the maturation of PDE6 and will rigorously interrogate this model by
leveraging our heterologous expression system for cone PDE6C in HEK293T cells, and
rod PDEAB in the Pde6g-/-/Pde6ccpfl1 mouse model. In addition, we will use the HSP90
knockout mouse, which highlights the importance of HSP90 in photoreceptor cells
because of its rapid retinal degeneration phenotype, to test our hypothesis that defects in
PDE6 maturation are the key cause of the degenerative phenotype. Elucidation of the
molecular mechanisms of PDE6 maturation will have important implications for retinal
diseases and the design of new therapeutic strategies."
10763839,"PROJECT SUMMARY: During autoimmunity, the body incorrectly identifies “self” molecules as foreign. In
multiple sclerosis (MS) attack of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) leads to neurodegeneration. Existing
therapies for MS range from immunosuppressants to newer monoclonal antibodies, but even the latter do not
distinguish between healthy and self-reactive cells displaying the antibody target. Thus, while beneficial, existing
therapies are not curative, cause immunocompromising side effects, and require life-long compliance. These
limitations have motivated efforts to control autoimmunity with vaccine-like specificity, leaving the rest of the
immune system intact. One such antigen-specific tolerance strategy being studied pre-clinically and in human
trials is co-delivery of myelin peptide and tolerizing immune signals to promote populations, such as regulatory
T cells (TREG) that combat MS. The polarization of T cells into inflammatory T cells (e.g., TH17) or TREG is localized
to lymph nodes (LNs), tissues that coordinate immunity. New studies also reveal TREG can adopt memory
functions to maintain tolerance. Further, in appropriate tissue niches, inflammatory TH17 cells can
transdifferentiate to TREG. Likewise, B cells are relevant to MS in several ways, including producing pathogenic
myelin-specific antibodies, and as therapeutic targets able to adopt regulatory function. LNs play key roles in
these processes, directing dynamic stromal organization to promote and regulate cell interaction and modulatory
cues that control T and B cell polarization between (auto)inflammatory and tolerance functions. From a
therapeutic view, controlling this niche is challenging using conventional delivery technologies (e.g., systemic
injections/infusions), and even biomaterial approaches such as targeted nanoparticles face difficulty establishing
durable tissue environments after injection. However, the ability to understand and control the integration of
signals in the LN microenvironment could enable potent, myelin-specific immunotherapies that avoid
immunosuppression. We propose tackling this goal using a platform that combines direct intra-LN (i.LN.) injection
with controlled release biomaterial depots. We have shown diffusion-restricted polymer depots that are too large
to drain from LNs after injection concentrate and retain depot-loaded cargo in LNs. Using depots loaded with
myelin peptide and rapamycin - an immunoregulatory drug, we have shown a single treatment at the peak of
disease in a pre-clinical model of MS reverses paralysis for over 90 days. Efficacy is not achieved with i.LN.
injection of soluble cargo, or during injection of depots via traditional routes. We will use this interdisciplinary
immune engineering approach to understand how local controlled release promotes a tolerogenic stromal LN
environment and how these effects induce and maintain long-lasting tolerizing function against myelin in T and
B cells. The aims are 1) Define the robustness of efficacy and the underpinning therapeutic effects on
neuroinflammation, 2) Show the durability of tolerance is antigen-dependent and driven by TREG maintenance &
plasticity, 3) Show i.LN. depots disrupt germinal centers, reduce auto-antibodies, & induce tolerogenic B cells."
10767970,"Currently, there are no lasting treatments to restore degenerated articular cartilage in people with osteoarthritis. Many treatment strategies for osteoarthritis attempt to restore the extracellular matrix (ECM) to its native stiffness, but these approaches have not been successful. Instead, this project focuses on the ability for healthy cartilage to swell, which in conjunction with the stiffness of the ECM, helps support load and lower friction. The ability for cartilage to swell, or its osmotic pressure, is derived from the negatively charged sidechains of proteoglycans (aggrecan). These negatively charged groups (glycosaminoglycans) are lost in osteoarthritis. To restore the osmotic pressure, often measured as the fixed charge density, we propose developing synthetic aggrecan mimics made from polystyrene sulfonate. In conjunction with this treatment, we will develop a platform capable of resolving cartilage swelling in situ, which will help determine our treatment efficacy, while also contributing to a timeline of mechanical changes in the cartilage. To facilitate physiological relevance, our platform will evaluate swelling on full-stack equine explants. This project will first establish how typical OA-like processes, like enzymatic digestion, impact the in situ swelling in our cartilage explants. Then, we will test how more physiologically relevant OA precursors, such as mechanical injury or inflammation, lead to aberrant swelling behavior. Due to the orthogonal nature of swelling measurements to standard mechanical testing, we will be able to decouple mechanical changes derived by the osmotic pressure of the cartilage from those resulting from matrix damage. Finally, after synthesis of our polymer aggrecan mimics, we will test if our intervention can revert the swelling behavior of damaged cartilage into the swelling behavior seen in native cartilage. The impact of this work is a new treatment strategy based on the swelling behavior of cartilage: while swelling is equally important to the mechanical function of cartilage, it has not seen a similar level of research as an intervention target. We hypothesize that without restoring the swelling behavior, current OA treatment strategies are unlikely to be successful in the long term."

Bioinformatics Core C (Pellegrini). The Bioinformatics core will provide a central hub for data
analysis for the program projects. We will process next-generation sequence data to enable the
measurement of transcriptomes and epigenomes. This will be carried out for both bulk and single
cell genomic approaches. Moreover, we will also process spatial data and provide estimates of
cell types present across a tissue. As the focus of our program is to elucidate age dependent
changes in stem cells and other cell types, the core will also develop models of age associated
changes in genomic data. To this end, our core not only has expertise in the use of standard
machine learning methodologies to construct epigenetic clocks but has also developed new
methodologies to model non-linear associations between epigenetic data and age. This is of
relevance, as age associated genomic changes have been shown to often follow non-linear
trajectories that capture rapid changes early in development, followed by slower ones later in the
later part of the lifespan. Finally, the core will also assist the program by providing data
visualization interfaces to facilitate the analysis of complex single cell genomic data.
The director and scientists of the core not only have extensive expertise in the application of
standard data analysis platforms but have also developed multiple methodologies that will be
provided as a service within the core. This includes methods to align DNA methylation data (i.e.
BSBolt), model non-linear epigenetic trajectories (i.e. Epigenetic Pacemaker), deconvolute bulk
transcriptomic data to identify the cell type composition (i.e. GEDIT) as well as assign cell types
in single cell data (i.e. ACTINN) and finally to analyze transcriptomic data using signature
databases (i.e. SAVANT).
In conclusion, this core will provide cutting edge data analysis support to maximize the
interpretability of the genomic data that will be collected throughout this program and advance the
understanding of age associated transcriptomic and epigenomic changes."
10768510,"SUMMARY
 The loss of tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity is an almost ubiquitous aspect of mammalian
aging. Underlying this age-related change is a decline in the potential of tissue-specific stem cells to participate
in tissue maintenance and repair. In skeletal muscle, this has been amply demonstrated for the resident
muscle stem cells (MuSCs), whose response to injury has been shown to decline with age in. Nevertheless,
the molecular basis of the cellular changes that integrate cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic influences to render
MuSCs less responsive with age is not well understood. Likewise, the molecular basis for the restoration of
youthful function to aged stem cells by rejuvenating interventions remain to be elucidated. Understanding these
fundamental mechanisms of MuSC aging and rejuvenation will provide the potential for being able to intervene
to restore youthful characteristics to aged stem cells, thus enhancing aged tissue repair and regeneration.
 Toward these goals, this Project focuses on key themes of the Overall Program of epigenetics in stem cell
aging. In Aim 1, focusing on the intersection of metabolism and epigenetics in collaboration with Project 2,
we will focus on the mechanisms of loss of heterochromatin in MuSCs with age, focusing on the role of the
metabolite s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its role in histone methylation reactions are relevant to
heterochromatin formation and maintenance. This Aim will rely heavily on the bioinformatic resources of
Core C. In Aim 2, we will expand our studies for “rejuvenating interventions” (specifically, diet (in the form of
fasting) and exercise, in collaboration with Projects 2 and 3) pursued during the previous grant cycle to
examine. We will examine the downstream mediators of the beneficial effects of these interventions, studying
them both in terms of the metabolic and epigenetic pathways explored in Aim 1 and also in terms of unbiased
assessments. In Aim 3, we will examine age-related heterogeneities of MuSCs at the single cell and spatial
levels, focusing on our recent findings of the bimodality of aged MuSCs in terms of glutathione levels. In close
collaboration with Core B, we will use MIBI-TOF technology to test for regional variations as correlates and
determinants of specific subsets of MuSCs that we have identified in aged muscle. In close collaboration
with Core C, we will continue to develop spatial transcriptomic analysis of MuSC niche heterogeneity in a
broader, unbiased fashion, taking advantage of the architecture of muscle and rarity of MuSCs to be able to
expand our targeted proteomic analyses to genome-wide transcriptomic analyses. Together, these studies will
advance our understanding of stem cell aging and approaches to restore youthful function to aged stem cells
as a way to enhance tissue homeostasis and repair in older individuals."
10768543,"Abstract
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies, tau neuropathology correlates with severity of
dementia. However, interventions for AD and AD related dementias (ADRDs) are limited to treatment
of symptoms that do not directly alter tau pathology or the resultant neurodegeneration. This
underscores the need for tau-targeted disease-modifying therapeutics. Our work has demonstrated
that MSUT2 controls neuronal susceptibility to tau toxicity in the mammalian brain. The mechanism of
MSUT2 modulation of tauopathy involves the MSUT2 CCCH domain binding to poly(A) RNA, as
deletion of the CCCH domain suppresses neurodegeneration in mouse models of tauopathy. The
identification of single chain antibody or nanobody leads that inhibit MSUT2 from binding to poly(A)
RNA will provide a biologic means of intervening against tauopathy. We hypothesize that biologic
antagonism of MSUT2/poly(A) RNA-binding after onset of pathological tau deposition will
reverse the toxic consequences of pathological tau. The specific aims of this proposal will develop
potent and specific brain-penetrant biologic based approaches to target MSUT2 and use them to
dissect the temporal and mechanistic relationship between MSUT2 activity and tauopathy. Completion
of the project as proposed will also further demonstrate the importance of MSUT2 in tauopathy. This
knowledge will set the stage for future translational studies by both generating MSUT2 specific lead
biologic agents and further validating a novel candidate therapeutic target for intervention in tauopathy
disorders."

We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and
MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in
which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care
disparities. Now in its 21st year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered over 30 PhD degrees. During their
predoctoral work, 29 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 14
were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF/Merck
awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to date have entered postdoctoral work: 23 in
academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life
Sciences Award; 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award; 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner’s award; and 1 who
pursued postdoctoral work at GlaxoSmithKline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-
evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve
and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central
strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a
laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to
work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect
PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and department
seminars and works-in-progress presentations. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community
and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of
psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/Journal Clubs, lunches with advisors and
guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration
into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master’s student community of the Graduate School, which whom
PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities. The Program joins a
Regional PREP Symposium, at which the PREP scholars present their work and network. The Program
maintains close touch with PREP alumni through emails, reunions, and alumni visits."

The ultimate goal in the field of RNA sequencing (transcriptomics and epitranscriptomics) is single-molecule,
high-accuracy, de novo RNA sequencing, including the ability to sequence modified bases without the need for
additional techniques/methods that add time, cost, and sample requirements. Unfortunately, current
transcriptomic sequencing technologies are costly, have low accuracy (specifically relative to DNA sequencing
approaches), they can require reverse transcription that removes the identity of modified bases
(limiting/prohibiting epitranscriptomic investigations), and/or they can use or require processive enzymes that fail
to traverse certain types of sequences. During this Phase I SBIR project, we will develop a sequencing
technology/methodology that overcomes these short comings, and is capable of state-of-the-art, RNA
sequencing and characterization. More specifically, we will develop and demonstrate an approach for
controllably and iteratively translocating single RNA molecules back-and-forth through a nanopore reader such
that single molecules can be directly and repeatedly sequenced, and corresponding ultra-high accuracy
consensus sequence determinations can be made. Furthermore, during this project, we will demonstrate the
ability to multiplex the associated measurement, significantly reducing the risk associated with developing a high-
throughput, single-molecule sequencing system following this effort. Nanopore-based technology has the
potential to enable complete and comprehensive RNA sequencing, and to be a field-leading technology in the
future. During this project, we will take steps toward making that future a reality by developing and optimizing all
components of our technology and then demonstrating RNA sequencing, including the ability to sequence N6-
methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and pseudouridine (Ψ). We will then show the functionality and
advantages of the developed technology by benchmarking our approach against current nanopore-based

10760660,"The Gardner Laboratory uses a combination experimental and computational approach to
dissect molecular mechanisms for how microtubule lengths are regulated inside of cells, and for
how forces within the mitotic spindle act to ensure proper chromosome segregation during
mitosis. We use biophysical computational modeling to better integrate and understand our
experimental observations, make new experimental predictions, and to test whether our
proposed cellular mechanisms are physically reasonable. Overall, we are a cellular biophysics
laboratory that combines cell biology tools with biophysical methods to shed new light on the
regulation of microtubule dynamics, and to dissect forces and their consequences in mitosis.
Achieving the goals described in this application will provide mechanistic insights into how
molecular-scale changes in microtubule structure could regulate cellular-scale changes in
microtubule-associated protein localization and binding, as well as how controlled mitotic forces
could act to protect genome integrity during mitosis. In particular, this application will advance
our understanding of: 1) how microtubule structure can alter protein binding, and vice versa, 2)
how the cell reads out and responds to nuanced tension signaling during mitosis, and 3) how
controlled anaphase forces could act to protect genome integrity during anaphase."

Low-cost DNA sequencing has provided researchers with abundant genomic data in which to search for the
unique footprints left by natural selection. However, many nonadaptive forces can obscure these signals, making
it important to develop statistical methods that can account for multiple factors that influence genetic variation.
My research in this area focuses on the design and application of statistical approaches for identifying regions
undergoing positive selection, which increases the frequency of beneficial alleles in a population, and balancing
selection, which maintains the frequency of distinct alleles in a population. During the past four years of my MIRA
ESI, my group contributed to a number of methodological advances, including designing the first likelihood
methods to detect positive selection from haplotype distributions, state-of-the-art likelihood methods to detect
ancient balancing selection within and across species, the first likelihood method to detect positive selection by
adaptive introgression, and the first machine learning method to detect positive selection by explicitly modeling
genomic autocorrelation. Applications of our methods to empirical data led to several novel insights, including
evidence of convergent positive selection in Europeans and East Asians, positive selection at olfactory genes
that affect communication and behavior in New York City rats, and balancing selection at venom genes that may
influence predator-prey coevolutionary dynamics in rattlesnakes. During the next five years, I propose to develop
improved statistical and machine learning approaches to detect complex modes of adaptation by leveraging
information about how different evolutionary forces simultaneously shape the distribution of genetic diversity
around adaptive sites. In particular, my future research program will be subdivided into several interrelated goals:
designing likelihood frameworks to identify positive and balancing selection while accounting for genomic,
temporal, and spatial autocorrelations; developing methods to identify regions that underwent complex positive
and balancing selection from ancient variation; introducing signal processing approaches to extract features from
images of genomic variation for use in machine learning models of adaptation; and building innovative domain
adaptation procedures to circumvent genetic and demographic parameter uncertainty when training machine
learning predictors of adaptation. Availability of these methods will empower researchers to address important
questions about adaptation in model and non-model organisms from ancient and contemporary samples,
increasing inclusivity in the field, and thereby broadening our knowledge about adaptation. Further, we will apply
these methods to answer or revisit key evolutionary questions about the roles of different adaptive mechanisms
in primates, rodents, snakes, insects, plants, and other organisms with complex or unknown demographic
histories. Advantages of these studies are two-fold, in that they will yield powerful new approaches for identifying
signatures of diverse modes of adaptation from genomic data, as well as elucidate evolutionary forces underlying
the acquisition of adaptive phenotypes, such as those involved in disease resistance and pathogen defense."
10762947,"Project Summary. In complex ecosystems, microbes use secondary metabolism as a means to communicate
within and control their local environment. Some of these products have had profound utility for the treatment
of human diseases, particularly infectious disease, where a large percentage of currently prescribed antibiotics
are based on or derived from natural products of microbial origin. This program develops, evaluates and
implements a new activity-based single cell genomics approach for the discovery of antibiotic candidates from
host-associated marine microbes. The research in this collaborative program involves sample collection, single
cell genomics, bioinformatics analysis of genomic data with focus on antibiotic producing gene clusters,
engineering the most promising clusters into host strains, and flow cytometry-based guided production of these
compounds. Using three marine soft-bodied macroorgansims as models (nudibranchs, tunicates and
sponges), our team will use a new synthase-selected approach to identify unexplored PKS producing symbiotic
microbes, evaluate their genomes for PKS systems and use this genomic data to guide the reconstruction of
PKS production in laboratory tractable hosts. The expected results will advance the discovery of novel
antibiotic candidates from the microbiomes of marine animals."

Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema affects 1.2 million patients in the United States
and has no cure. The symptoms of lymphedema include fatigue, tightness, pain, and
life-threatening infections. However, two-thirds of women undergoing breast cancer
treatment with the highest risk factors for developing lymphedema do not develop the
disease. While there is no explanation for this finding, one hypothesis is that normal
anatomic variations of the lymphatic system pre-dispose certain women to developing
lymphedema after breast cancer treatment. Specifically, the main back-up lymphatic
pathway of the arm, the Mascagni-Sappey (MS) pathway, is variably present in cadaver
studies and avoids areas that are usually damaged with breast cancer treatment.
Moreover, when present in these cadaver studies, the MS pathway has variable
anatomic connections which can impact its ability to drain the arm effectively. We
hypothesize that, utilizing modern imaging techniques, we can define the anatomy of
the MS pathway and its variations in normal women and in breast cancer survivors who
have undergone high risk breast cancer treatment and did not develop lymphedema.
Utilizing this information, we will be able to predict which variations predispose women
to develop lymphedema. Finally, we will develop a novel method of non-invasive intra-
operative optical imaging to assess the function of this pathway during breast cancer
operations to predict the patient's risk of developing lymphedema. The ability to
evaluate real-time lymphatic function would allow cancer teams to implement preventive
interventions in high risk patients. As the most common cause of lymphedema in the
United States is secondary to cancer procedures, this model of lymphedema prevention
could be widely applied to the treatment of other high risk cancer populations including
gynecologic cancers, urologic cancers, skin cancers, and sarcomas."

 Immune checkpoints play an important role in restraining the immune response, maintaining self-
tolerance and preventing excessive collateral damage. Immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer
immunotherapy but can lead to immune related adverse events (IrAEs). Patients receiving programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade can develop IrAEs including vitiligo, colitis, endocrinopathies, and Sicca
Syndrome, an autoimmune disease characterized by the accumulation of immune cells in the salivary and
lacrimal glands, leading to deterioration and dysfunction. After immune cell activation, PD-1 is upregulated, and
upon interacting with its ligand PD-L1, PD-1 signaling results in reduced proliferation, cytokine production, and
cytotoxicity. PD-1 is expressed on infiltrating lymphocytes of the salivary gland including natural killer (NK) and
T cells. Hyporesponsive immune cells in the salivary gland are thought to retain the integrity of this delicate
tissue, while inadvertently contributing to viral latency. While trying to understand why lymphocytes in this organ
are hyporesponsive, I unexpectedly found that genetic loss of PD-1 results in increased CD8+ T cell number and
frequency in the salivary glands of naïve animals. Additional preliminary data suggests that NK cells may control
CD8+ T cell expansion in the salivary gland. Based on these data, I hypothesize that in order to preserve the
integrity of the salivary gland, NK cells may control T cell proliferation via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in this organ.
Therefore, in Specific Aim 1, I will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PD-1 regulates CD8+ T cells in
the salivary gland, and characterize the transcriptome and effector functions of the expanded CD8+ T cell
population. In Specific Aim 2, I will characterize the potential immunopathological consequences of CD8+ T cell
expansion in the PD-1 KO salivary gland by assessing histopathology and saliva secretions. These studies of
PD-1 on salivary gland immune cells should provide insights for prevention and treatments of IrAEs. In
preparation for the proposed work, my training has taken place in the outstanding immunology laboratory of Dr.
Laurent Brossay, as well as within the supportive Pathobiology Graduate Program. My training experience will
be enriched by attending and presenting at national and international conferences, and thoughtful mentoring by
my sponsor. Completion of this proposal will prepare me with a repertoire of skills and the key foundational
knowledge required for a successful career as an independent researcher."

A key feature of progressive fibrotic diseases of the lungs, including in patients with silicosis, is the excessive
deposition of scar tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly collagen1a1 (Col1a1). Fibroblasts are
known to be resistant to apoptosis and persist in fibrotic lungs, continuing to lay down matrix, contributing to a
progressive and persistent phenotype in patients. Fibroblasts that participate in this pathogenic process have
most commonly been identified by αSMA staining and termed myofibroblasts. However, recent work by our group
and others has shown that αSMA does not identify all pathogenic fibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis. This proposal
seeks to address the central hypothesis that elimination of persistent collagen-producing fibroblasts is critical in
halting disease progression. Based on our robust preliminary studies, we propose three specific aims to test this
central hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will determine the accumulation and localization of Col1a1+ fibroblasts to the
fibrosis associated after silica exposure using a lineage tracing strategy. We hypothesize that Col1a1+ fibroblasts
accumulate and persist in mouse lungs during silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In Aims 2 and 3 we ask if the
loss of Col1a1+ fibroblasts prevents fibrosis progression. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the
progression of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice is arrested after the selective and targeted ablation of
Col1a1+ fibroblasts. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that genetic loss of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in
Col1a1+ fibroblasts promotes their susceptibility to undergo intrinsic apoptosis during silica-induced pulmonary
fibrosis resulting in the arrest of disease progression. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for silicosis
and no therapies that stop or reverse fibrosis for pulmonary fibrosis in general. Thus, there is a critical need to
identify molecular pathways or cell populations that are targetable for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the
proposed studies will provide a novel and mechanistic understanding about pathogenic fibroblast accumulation
and persistence in driving the progression of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

Alcohol Use disorder (AUD) is a disorder in which alcohol alters a wide range of neural circuits to cause
maladaptive behaviors across several behavioral domains. Despite the prevalence and cost of this disorder,
treatment strategies are ineffective, especially in preventing relapse. A key feature in some individuals is the
induction of negative affective states when alcohol consumption is ceased. In these individuals, alcohol taking
and seeking is hypothesized to be motivated by negative reinforcement, where individuals continue
consuming alcohol to avoid negative internal states that are triggered by abstinence. While past research has
focused on how abstinence produces negative affective states, the question remains as to how affective
disturbances motivate behavior (i.e. negative reinforcement). To this end, the goal of this proposal to
understand how circuits that control the motivation to avoid aversive stimuli are engaged by alcohol and
associated cues to drive alcohol seeking. At the center of reinforcement is the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The
NAc is a heterogeneous region primarily composed of two non-overlapping cell types: D1 and D2 medium
spiny projection neurons (MSNs) which play complementary roles in controlling motivated behaviors4. While
previous work has implicated D1 MSNs in positive reinforcement, our data show that D2 MSNs respond to
cues that signal negative reinforcement and causally control the motivation to avoid aversive stimuli.
We hypothesize that D2 MSNs are engaged by alcohol-associated cues following withdrawal from chronic
intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE; achieved via vapor inhalation), and drive alcohol seeking.
 To address these questions, will use a variety of cutting-edge optical approaches to record from and
manipulate these cells to define the temporal patterns by which they respond to alcohol associated cues and
link this to alcohol seeking following CIE exposure. We will determine how the development of D2 responses to
alcohol-associated cues is predicted by the negative affective states that develop over withdrawal from CIE.
Finally, using patch clamp electrophysiology with channelrhodopsin assisted circuit mapping we will 1) define
how CIE changes glutamatergic drive onto D2 MSNs that are specifically activated by negative reinforcement
(from the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and basolateral amygdala) and 2) use drugs acutely restricted by
tethering (DARTS) in vivo to prevent glutamatergic drive selectively through AMPA receptors on NAc cells
activated by negative reinforcement and prevent alcohol seeking. Together, we will define how this critical cell
population that controls negative reinforcement drives operant alcohol seeking. This understanding will be
critical to our conceptualization of AUD and why individuals drink following withdrawal."

Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women of color from low-socioeconomic geographical locations.
Locations, such as sub-Saharan Africa, can also have a high incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
infection, and access to cervical cancer screening is generally limited for women living in these underserved
communities. Furthermore, People Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWH) have evidence of
premature aging, which could contribute to cervical cancer progression and responses to chemoradiation therapy
(CRT). CRT is the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer, and older women (≥52 years of age)
treated with CRT have worse side effects than younger (<52 years) women, suggesting that advanced age may
influence clinical outcomes from CRT for cervical cancer. Many of the hallmarks of cancer, including
tumorigenesis, tumor maintenance, therapy resistance, and immune evasion, are regulated by epigenetic
changes in DNA (e.g., DNA methylation). DNA methylation levels are correlated with (1) chronological clocks,
which estimate the age of a sample/patient, or (2) biological clocks, a widely accepted measure of where an
individual is in their lifespan, regardless of chronological age, which can be reflective of disease morbidity and
mortality risk. Indeed, the biological age of PLWH (i.e., HIV-mediated epigenetic age) is advanced up to 20 years
beyond chronological age; however, studies examining epigenetic aging in PLWH have not evaluated premature
aging in PLWH with cervical cancer, nor the contribution, if any, of oncologic therapy on premature aging.
Preliminary data comparing women living with HIV(WHIV) vs. HIV-negative cervical cancer patients indicate that
biological aging, defined using patterns of methylation that accumulate on host DNA over time, was significantly
accelerated in WHIV vs. HIV-negative cervical cancer patients, and this accelerated aging was significantly
associated with mortality after cancer diagnosis. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that a biomarker of
aging can be identified and will correlate with systemic and tumor immunologic phenotype and function that can
be used, in the future, to select WHIV and cervical cancer for novel therapeutic regimens. In Aim 1, differences
in DNA methylation will be compared between WHIV vs. HIV-negative patients with cervical cancer. Aim 2 will
focus on measuring systemic and tumor immune cell phenotype, function, and repertoire that will be correlated
with biologic age at pre-CRT and 1 year post-CRT. Furthermore, Aim 3 will focus on determining an association
of longitudinal (pre-CRT and 1-year post-CRT), biologic age changes with clinical outcomes. Results from the
proposed work are expected to elucidate how oncologic treatment in the setting of immunosuppression due to
HIV infection impacts the aging process and, through detailed interrogation of immune cells, to link aging to
underlying biological features that may exacerbate disparities in clinical outcomes observed in women living with
HIV and cervical cancer."

 Substantial evidence supports health benefits associated with aspirin use, particularly for individuals at
increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2016, the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force recommended low-dose (81 mg) aspirin for primary prevention of CVD and CRC despite
an incomplete understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying aspirin’s effects on the colon. We have
proposed an interrelated framework for aspirin’s biological mechanisms through direct inhibition of
prostaglandins within epithelial cells. To expand this framework, we now propose the novel hypothesis supported
by compelling preliminary data that the gut microbiome may mediate the biological effects on colorectal mucosa
associated with aspirin. The gut microbiome is a key determinant for gut homeostasis and is increasingly
implicated in the development of colorectal neoplasia. However, prospective studies are required to define the
specific role of the gut microbiome in the development of mucosa at-risk for neoplasia and how microbial
dynamics are impacted following intervention with aspirin. The overall goal of this proposal is to interrogate the
joint impact of aspirin on colonic epithelial cells and the gut microbiome in humans to refine and establish causal
mechanisms, including PG pathways, which will be further validated using novel, in vitro, patient-derived
modeling approaches. We hypothesize that by fully interrogating these additional mechanisms an integrated
network may be developed that comprehensively informs a precision prevention strategy. To address this, we
will leverage biospecimens (colonic biopsies and stool) collected within our randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of aspirin, ASPIRED.
 In Aim 1, we will deeply characterize the effects of randomized aspirin treatment on colorectal mucosa
through RNA sequencing of epithelial cells collected from mucosal biopsies and on the gut microbiome by
performing integrated whole-shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics to investigate the
effect of randomized aspirin treatment on the gut microbiome. In Aim 2, will leverage intestinal organoid cultures,
or three-dimensional ‘mini-guts’, to culture epithelial cells derived from the same patients with aspirin (direct
effects) and/or a priori microbial metabolites (indirect effects) to refine chemopreventive mechanisms. The results
will further elucidate a role for the gut microbiome in the health and disease states of the alimentary tract and
aligns with the overall mission of the NIDDK. This proposal will also offer a promising young investigator the
opportunity to further develop a niche within which to pursue independent lines of inquiry and expand his
bioinformatics and translational methodological skillsets. This will be an important first step for the candidate to
achieve his goal of leveraging basic science training (pre-doctoral) and experience in clinical gastroenterology
trials (post-doctoral) to become an effective bridge between the laboratory and the clinic as an independent
academic investigator."

Recently, the potential of cellular therapy based upon genetic reprogramming of T cells via CAR-T technology
has been explored for diseases of the heart, and the promise embodied in this strategy has captured popular
and scientific imagination. However, in current clinical CAR-T cell therapy practice, extracorporeal methods must
be applied, which represent a major time and cost barrier restricting wider implementation of this technology.
Thus, robust methods to generate CAR-T in situ, within the patients, would greatly facilitate the practical
application of this promising approach. For this, we propose to develop a robust gene delivery system consisting
of a conjoined “SAd.AAV” nano-vector with multiple T cell-tropic adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) conjugated to
a clinically approved, T-cell tropic simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus 36 (SAd) on its capsid's surface. Of note,
both capsid-engineered SAd and AAVs are able to selectively target various tissues including T cells with high
transduction efficiencies, and we hypothesized that SAd.AAV may therefore provide superior targeting through
the combined effects of both engineered viral capsids targeting different receptors on the same tissue or cell
type. Importantly, AAVs carrying single-stranded knock-in donor DNA templates have been widely shown to
support high editing efficiency of homology directed repair (HDR). Furthermore, the robust but transient
expression of gene editor by SAd also provides highly desirable “hit-and-run” gene editing reducing potential
adverse effects associated with prolonged editor expression after the on-target editing is achieved. Therefore,
by virtue of the advantages of each virus in gene editing, SAd.AAV potentially increases the tissue targeting
specificity and efficiency and improves safety of existing CRISPR-Cas gene editing therapies. As a proof of
concept, after constructing and characterizing the first T cell-targeted SAd.AAV, we plan to achieve efficient
production of the heart disease-specific CAR-T cells in vivo with an SAd.AAV gene editing platform to knock-in
a switchable CARi transgene in the T cells in vivo. A proof-of-principle demonstration of in vivo production of
gene-edited switchable CARi-T cells will establish a key platform for follow-on studies of CARi-T interventions in
murine models of heart diseases. We furthermore anticipate that the SAd.AAV can be rapidly redesigned to
target a wide variety of clinically important organs relevant to the NHLBI for gene editing-based therapies."
10890176,"Background. This proposal entitled “""Nuclear receptor regulation of epigenetic mechanisms regulating HIV CNS
latency"" is submitted in response to RFA-MH-22-280: Epigenetic Mechanisms Regulating HIV CNS Latency and
Neuropathogenesis Using Novel Single Cell Technologies”. Microglial cells are the main target of HIV infection
in the central nervous system (CNS) and form a reservoir of infection that persists despite antiviral treatment and
contributes to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).
Our goal. Using microglia cellular models, we demonstrated previously that the Nurr1 nuclear receptor, working
in conjunction with ligand-activated nuclear receptors, plays a critical role in the regulation of HIV latency. We
confirmed these observations in iPSC-derived human microglia (iMG), which provide the most informative
primary cell model to study the interaction between HIV and this important target cell. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that agonists of the Nurr1, RXR and RAR nuclear receptors lead to HIV silencing, suggesting
a novel therapeutic strategy for HIV infections in the CNS. Underpinning this work are two key technical
advances allowing the study of HIV in human microglia. First, we now have the capability to study HIV latency
using iMG alone or in combination with iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes - the first available model systems
that do not rely on transformed cell lines. Second, in collaboration with the Cannon laboratory, we established a
humanized mouse model of HIV latency in microglia based on the new NOG-hIL34 transgenic mouse, which is
We demonstrated that the
humanized mice support latent HIV infection of human microglia. We have been able to identify latently infected
cells recovered from the humanized mice. In addition, we applied single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to
confirm that the microglia have transcriptional characteristics that match reference human microglia and further
identified subsets of reactive microglial cells that are associated with active HIV infections.
the only humanized mouse model to support full human microglial cell maturation.
Using these models,
we will apply highly sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and single cell sequencing and epigenomics
analyses to define nuclear receptor interactions with the HIV promoter region, and the mechanism of epigenetic
silencing on the HIV LTR.
How will we advance the field? Numerous clinically-effective, brain-penetrant drugs that regulate the nuclear
receptors are available, many of which are now FDA approved, and will be evaluated using the iPSC derived
cell models and in the humanized mouse model for their impact on HIV expression and latency in the context of
an intact brain. We are undertaking these technically challenging studies because it is only by working within the
context of authentic human microglial cells and an environment that better reflects the HIV-infected CNS, that
the underlying physiology is accurately represented. We believe these studies will allow us to obtain a convincing
proof-of-concept for this important therapeutic strategy to target HIV CNS Latency and Neuropathogenesis."

The goal of this training program entitled “Training in Computational Neuroscience and Data Analysis” is
to help undergraduate and predoctoral students gain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need to
flourish in a scientific career that brings quantitative approaches to the study of neuroscience and

Brandeis University that expired recently after 10 years of NIDA support. Given the increasing
importance of machine learning in data analysis and solving of data-rich scientific problems, coupled with
recent Brandeis hires in the field, our new program will include more participation from computer science
faculty with expertise in the field. Also, given the recent introduction of an applied mathematics major at
Brandeis and associated new faculty in the field, we have doubled the number of training labs with
students working on mathematical modeling in neuroscience. The proposed program requests funding
to support 6 undergraduates, 4 NRSA eligible graduate students, and 2 non-NRSA eligible graduate
students each year. We will target two cohorts of prospective trainees: 1) Individuals with strong prior
experience with quantitative methods who wish to work in neuroscience. 2) Individuals with backgrounds
in psychology, neuroscience and biology who wish to learn to employ quantitative and computational
methods to tackle important problems in neuroscience. We will continue prioritizing outreach activities
aimed at ensuring trainees from underrepresented populations are included in our program. Students will
have two complementary mentors so they participate in labs with both quantitative and experimental
approaches to neuroscience. The 26 training faculty have research expertise ranging from human
cognition to cellular and molecular neuroscience, so a wide variety of research problems, at numerous
levels of analysis are available to trainees. The training faculty were chosen based on demonstrated
commitment to the use of theoretical and computational methods and interdisciplinary collaboration to
understand the nervous system in health and disease. Students will take courses in statistics, data
analysis, computational neuroscience, obtain skills in building models of neurons, synapses, and
networks, and employ these in a variety of independent research projects. In addition to course work and
laboratory research, students and trainees will be engaged in a large number of other activities designed
to enhance their speaking skills, writing skills, and ability to collaborate with other scientists. All students
and trainees will receive training in the responsible conduct of science and will interact with senior

Cancer is a collection of complex, heterogeneous, and devastating diseases; however, one common theme is
recurrent and high-frequency mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. In contrast to other tumor
suppressors, most TP53 alterations are missense mutations and these exhibit gain-of-function phenotypes that
are dependent of transcriptional rewiring. This proposal is focused on the role of p53 missense mutations in
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Breast cancers are widespread malignancies representing 15% of all
cancer deaths in women worldwide. 80-88% of basal-like breast cancers, the majority of which are TNBC, have
mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor. We have recently developed the first genetically engineered mouse
model of somatic breast cancer driven by p53 missense mutations. This conditional model represents a major
advance as it expresses mutant p53 from the endogenous locus and maintains wild-type p53 in the stroma and
immune system. Moreover, our model faithfully mimics the histology of human TNBC, and develops TNBC with
a one year latency. Moreover, in these mice, deletion of mutant p53 with CRISPR-Cas9 results in tumor
regression and increased survival, indicating that the breast tumors are addicted to mutant p53. In addition, we
see increased infiltration of T lymphocytes upon tumor regression. In this study, we propose to understand the
biology of TNBC initiated by a somatic p53 driver mutation and determine why these tumors are addicted to
mutant p53. This work combines our elegant and disease relevant mouse models of TNBC with state-of-the-
art genomic profiling to comprehensively understand the mechanisms underlying mutant p53 driven breast
cancer. Moreover, we will use cell lines recently derived from our model that are also addicted to mutant p53
as a platform to undertake a functional genomics screen to identify novel vulnerabilities in these cancers.
Immune based therapies have revolutionized cancer care. Therefore to effectively advance mutant p53 directed
therapies, a comprehensive understanding of the immune landscape and response is needed. Since our
somatic breast model uniquely retains a WT p53 microenvironment and immune compartment, we are in an
ideal position to examine the immune response to mutant p53 directed therapies. Our specific aims are: Aim
1. To understand the underlying biology that drives breast cancer development in p53-null versus mutant mice,
we will perform whole exome sequence analyses. To identify the molecular pathways that lead to addiction of
mutant p53 breast cancers, we will perform RNA-seq analyses of somatic p53R172H breast tumors with and
without deletion of mutant p53. Aim 2. To determine the molecular pathways downstream of mutant p53 that
are essential for tumor maintenance using CRISPR/Cas9 functional screens. Aim 3. To understand and exploit
the immune response to therapeutic inhibition of mutant p53 in breast cancer. Because our conditional mouse
model shares the underlying molecular pathology with human sporadic tumors, it will be more predictive of
human responses to drugs, and thus a valuable tool in preclinical testing."

Although multiple sclerosis (MS) is classically considered a demyelinating disease, neuro-axonal loss occurs in
both relapsing and progressive phases of the disease and represents the primary pathologic correlate of disa-
bility. Existing therapies primarily target the peripheral immune system, preventing clinical relapses but largely
failing to prevent neurodegeneration in progressive MS. Therapies with a primary neuroprotective mode of ac-
tion are a major goal of current research, both to slow disability in progressive MS and to limit injury when re-
lapses occur despite current therapies. Nitric oxide (NO), a toxic free radical produced by central nervous sys-
tem (CNS) macrophages and microglia, contributes to neuro-axonal injury in both relapsing and progressive
MS and in models of neuroinflammation, with NO-induced mitochondrial dysfunction playing a major role. Spe-
cific, druggable signaling pathways that mediate this injury have not been identified. We propose to study a
candidate signaling pathway involving nitrosylation of the protein GAPDH. Nitrosylated GAPDH (SNO-GAPDH)
translocates to both nucleus and mitochondria, with an established role in cell death and nuclear targets, such
as SIRT1 and PGC-1α, critical for mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, SNO-GAPDH signaling can be
blocked by CGP3466, a highly specific, oral CNS-penetrant drug with an established safety profile in humans
and a low threshold for clinical translation. We have preliminary evidence that SNO-GAPDH signaling is active
in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of neuroinflammation, and in white
matter tissue obtained post-mortem from MS patients. We have found that systemic administration of
CGP3466 attenuates neurologic disability in C57BL/6 MOG35-55/CFA EAE and prevents impairment of neuronal
mitochondrial respiration in cultured neurons exposed to NO. In the proposed studies, we plan to fully charac-
terize SNO-GAPDH pathway activity in MOG35-55/CFA EAE and post-mortem human MS tissue. We will deter-
mine whether the protective effects of CGP3466 in EAE derive from a primary neuroprotective mechanism in-
dependent of peripheral immune effects, differentiating it from current therapies and establishing its pre-clinical
potential. Finally, we will seek mechanistic insights by evaluating the effects of SNO-GAPDH on neuronal mito-
chondrial function. Positive results from this mechanistic and pre-clinical therapeutic research will establish a
new therapeutic approach for MS and neuroinflammatory disease more broadly. The PI's career development
plan will provide new training opportunities in immunology, models of neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial
bioenergetics, providing a foundation for future independent studies of inflammatory neurodegeneration."

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the role of tissue specific stem/progenitor cells and their capacity
for division and renewal. In tissues such as the breast, these cells undergo expansive growth and
differentiation with every pregnancy. Yet, mechanisms regulating the generation of binucleated, milk-producing
alveolar cells are scarcely understood. Until this knowledge gap is closed, we will be unable to support the
substantial number of women who produce insufficient milk. The long-term goal of this research is to
understand how mammals harness stem/progenitor cells to build a milk supply. Recently, it was discovered
that a large fraction of cells become polyploid during mammary alveologenesis, a process required for milk
production. This proposal's objective is to identify the signaling pathways regulating the generation of polyploid
cells via endoreplication in response to DNA damage generated by replication stress, and determine the
impact of these pathways on milk production. The central hypothesis is that ROBO-regulated NOTCH signaling
governs the DNA damage differentiation response and endoreplication that occurs in response to alveolar
progenitor cell expansion and differentiation. Our hypothesis is based on our own preliminary data that ROBOs
differentially regulate alveologenesis and Notch signaling, and that, together, Robo/Notch signaling regulates
the response to DNA damage, which we find occurring during alveologenesis. The rationale underlying this
proposal is that the identification of these pathways will allow for interventions, pharmacological or dietary, that
improve alveolar development and milk production. Guided by strong preliminary data, three hypotheses will
be tested in three Aims: 1) ROBO1 promotes differentiation by restricting the activation of one or more NOTCH
receptors in AVPs. 2) ROBO2 inhibits differentiation by activating the signaling of one or more Notch receptors
either directly or by acting through ROBO1. 3) Replication stress, occurring during the expansion phase of
pregnancy, is the source of DNA damage, triggering the DNA damage differentiation response and
endoreplication that is governed by Robo/Notch signaling. The proposed research is significant because it will
identify new methods for increasing milk production. The proposed research is innovative because we propose
that harnessing stem/progenitor cells can enhance milk production. Previous studies have focused on the
prolactin pathway and only yielded drugs with significant negative side effects. The proposed research will
have a positive impact for women who produce insufficient milk and their children who do not reap the benefits
of this “liquid gold”.

10755725,"Summary
Back pain is a leading cause of global disability and intervertebral disc (IVD) disorders play a role in specific and
non-specific pain and disability. While spinal surgery can effectively address specific causes of pain, discogenic
pain, or axial back pain with IVD degeneration as the most common diagnosis, is non-specific and lacks effective
treatment strategies. Causes of discogenic pain are hard to identify since radiographic IVD degeneration is
common in both symptomatic patients and pain-free controls, and treatment strategies are also non-specific.
Hence, a critical need exists for targeted and novel interventions for discogenic pain, yet current science is limited
by a lack of fundamental information on how IVD injury progresses to neuroinflammatory pathologies, and how
this can be modulated. In fact, surprisingly little is known about how IVDs and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) interact
in response to IVD injury and degeneration, although chronic inflammation involving tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNFα) plays a key role. Furthermore, almost no studies on sex differences in discogenic pain exist despite
known sex differences in pain transmission. This project addresses how IVD injury progresses to chronic
discogenic pain involving IVD degeneration and DRG neuroinflammation, and how this can be modulated. Our
premise is that IVD injuries progress to chronic discogenic pain via TNFα-modulated IVD degeneration, and
DRG sensitization and remodeling; and that the treatment of long-term discogenic pain is refractory with simple
treatments and requires interventions that target both IVD and neural pathologies. We developed a robustly
characterized in vivo rat discogenic pain model and novel interdisciplinary collaborations. Pilot results
demonstrate that TNFα is an essential factor in the onset of IVD degeneration and pain, and that TNFα receptor
1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 have distinct roles in the inflammatory cross-talk between IVDs and DRGs needing further
investigation to understand pathophysiology and identify treatments. Aim 1 determines the role of TNFα and its
receptors in the progression from IVD injury to chronic discogenic pain using a rat discogenic pain model and
human IVD cells. Aim 2 uses single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) to identify IVD and DRG cells and molecular
pathways important in long-term discogenic pain that are TNFα-mediated and affected by Atsttrin, a novel drug
that blocks TNFR1-related catabolism and promotes TNFR2-related anabolism. Aim 3 treats chronic discogenic
pain using Atsttrin, Duloxetine (an anti-depressant with efficacy for neuropathic pain), and combined treatments
to address both IVD degeneration and neuropathology. Aims use rat in vivo models and human in vitro cell
culture model systems with behavioral, gene and protein measurements, as well as next generation sequencing.
Outcomes of this project include determining the role of TNFα and its receptors in onset and progression of
discogenic pain; identifying TNFα-modulated cells and molecular pathways critical in the IVD-DRG of cross-talk
in long-term discogenic pain; developing novel treatment strategies for chronic discogenic pain; and identifying
potential sex differences in discogenic pain pathophysiology and treatment."
10755726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammation is crucial for the host defense response, but unregulated inflammation is a key element of
atherothrombosis and links plaque initiation to subsequent growth and acute rupture, leading to clinical
cardiovascular (CVD) events. Clinical trials of inflammation inhibition have significantly reduced CVD events,
confirmed the inflammation-CVD hypothesis, and stimulated interest in targeting inflammation specifically for
CVD prevention. Such therapies could have widespread impact, since residual inflammatory risk in clinical
practice is common and undertreated. Importantly, recent evidence demonstrates that the resolution of
inflammation is not a passive process but occurs in an active coordinated process involving chemical
mediators called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that include resolvins, maresins, lipoxins,
protectins (neuroprotectins), and aspirin-triggered pro-resolving mediators, each with characteristic biological
actions. Yet a major gap in knowledge is which specific SPMs or sets of SPMs may be cardioprotective in
human populations. Motivated by our exciting preliminary findings that plasma levels of certain SPMs are
related to CVD risk and inflammatory traits, and in response to NHLBI NOT-ES-20-018: Promoting
Fundamental and Applied Research in Inflammation Resolution to identify the role of SPMs in CVD, we
propose to test the hypothesis that specific SPMs are early indicators of CVD protection from
inflammation and are associated with its resolution over time. This cost-efficient proposal leverages
resources from three well-phenotyped and genotyped prospective studies. We will examine an extensive panel
of circulating plasma SPMs and proinflammatory mediators using a high-throughput mass spectrometry assay
in relation to incident CVD (total 2339 cases) including repeated measures over time in a subset. Our primary
aims are to: 1) Evaluate associations of SPMs with future CVD events in primary and secondary prevention
populations enriched with chronic inflammation, and assess effect modification by randomized aspirin therapy
vs placebo since aspirin has important pro-resolving effects on SPM biosynthesis; 2) Examine associations of
circulating SPMs with CVD risk factors and downstream biomarkers and cytokines of systemic inflammation;
and perform genome-wide association study of circulating SPMs, to better understand biological pathways for
mechanistic insights into SPM functions; and 3) Assess temporal changes in SPMs over time in relation to
concomitant changes in levels of downstream proinflammatory biomarkers and cytokines, and examine
modulation of SPMs with randomized low-dose methotrexate vs placebo. We will examine functional actions of
the relevant CVD-associated SPMs using ex vivo leukocyte assays for inflammatory gene expression and
macrophage pro-resolving function. Results from this proposal will identify and validate resolution mediators
and pathways that may play a pivotal role in cardioprotection and could have important public health
significance since residual inflammatory risk is common and remains undertreated with current therapeutics."

Practice-based research (PBR) has demonstrated effectiveness to integrate evidence-based care into clinical
practice, enhance the generalizability of research findings and conduct longitudinal studies not possible through
traditional randomized controlled studies. The PBR Networks (PBRN) in medicine began in 1970 and have
played a crucial role in advancing medical research findings and translating research evidence to practice
settings to enhance patient outcomes. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)
established the Dental Practice-Based Research Network in 2005 and it is now considered to be the largest
dental PBRN in the world. However, PBR experiences have yet to become part of the dental
predoctoral/postdoctoral curriculum. According to NIDCR, it is essential to ‘engage dental students in research
activities and incorporate evidence-based principles into the dental curriculum to enhance their critical thinking
skills to evaluate and incorporate new knowledge into practice.’ In this application, the Indiana University (IU)
School of Dentistry (IUSD) investigators with expertise in basic science, PBR, informatics, and salivary
diagnostics have established collaborations with the Indiana Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI),
IU School of Medicine (IUSM), Purdue College of Pharmacy, Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and Indiana Health
Information Exchange to advance clinical research training of dental clinical faculty and trainees, and strengthen
research mentoring partnership amongst students, clinical faculty and researchers. We will advance knowledge
of salivary and serum biomarkers in identifying dental patients susceptible to Sjögren’s Disease (SD), thus
improving patient outcomes and management of patients at risk for SD and manage through interprofessional
communication and collaboration of dental clinicians (DC), pharmacists, rheumatologists, and patients. This
application is significant because it seeks to 1) advance the knowledge and skills of next-generation DCs to
conduct and lead PBR, 2) facilitate interprofessional communication and care via virtual health platforms to
address dental patients’ conditions such as SD that require multidisciplinary expertise for timely diagnosis and
management and 3) develop a salivary hypofunction index in combination with salivary biomarkers to detect
patients susceptible to SD thus improving shared decision making and management of patients at risk for SD.
The outcomes include measurable increases in DC students and faculty completing clinical research and
mentoring training and participation in the proposed PBR study, validation of biomarkers for early detection of
SD in PBR settings, and improvement in coordinating care with other health care providers. The proposed
research is significant because it lays the foundation for multidisciplinary teams to diagnose and manage
individuals affected with SD in community practice settings and reduce current delays in diagnosis due to
fragmented and siloed dental-medical care."
10798334,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to elucidate the extent to which small vessel cerebrovascular
disease (svCBVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology are additive or synergistic in their effects on
neurodegeneration and cognition in midlife, and to determine if that differs across racial/ethnic groups.
Comorbid svCBVD and AD pathology is observed in most dementia cases at autopsy, and is more prevalent in
racial/ethnic minorities. Evidence is building that svCBVD has detrimental effects on amyloid clearance and tau
phosphorylation, which exacerbates neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD. It is crucial to include
svCBVD, amyloid, and tau when considering primary drivers of disease, and neurodegeneration and cognition
when considering the consequences of those primary drivers. While initial cognitive impairments in svCBVD
are in executive function and those in AD are in memory, the consequences of the two become less distinct
when they co-occur. Equally as important, studies in midlife are necessary to elucidate how svCBVD and AD
pathophysiology initially develop, and how a particular mixture of AD and svCBVD influences disease
progression. Aim 1 (K99) determines the biological consequence that svCBVD and amyloid have on tau-
related neurodegeneration, and explores racial/ethnic differences in these associations. Aim 2 (K99)
determines the cognitive consequence that svCBVD and amyloid have on tau-related memory dysfunction, and
explores racial/ethnic differences in these associations. The central hypothesis is that, in middle age,
individuals with svCBVD demonstrate more AD-related neurodegeneration and subsequently more cognitive
impairment, and that this effect will be stronger in racial/ethnic minorities due to the higher prevalence of
svCBVD. To achieve these goals, the applicant will undergo quick, but essential mentored training in three
areas: (1) tau and small vessel cerebrovascular disease, (2) applied neuroscience, and (3) advanced statistical
modeling. With these skills, the applicant will be well equipped to independently pursue Aim 3 (R00), which
determines the longitudinal consequences that baseline svCBVD and amyloid have on neurodegeneration and
memory decline over time. Understanding the consequences of single or mixed svCBVD and AD pathology will
inform therapeutic targets and help determine whether interventional strategies need to differ by race/ethnicity.
The strengths of this proposal include formal training in the underlying pathology represented by biomarkers
and its connection to cognition, as well as formal training in statistics to rigorously implement a flexible National
Institute on Aging(NIA)-Alzheimer’s Association-recommended research framework to directly address the
current missions of the NIA. For the applicant, this accelerated training period will facilitate the development of
an independent research program focused on large-scale neuroimaging studies of AD and related dementias
in diverse populations."
10757408,"SUMMARY: “Targeted therapies” against “driver oncogenes” play key roles in the therapy of many tumors,
including breast cancers caused by amplification of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2
(HER2+ BC). In metastatic HER2+ BC, however, resistance occurs even to combinations of anti-cancer
drugs, and preventing its emergence is essential for converting remissions to cures. “Drug-tolerant persisters”
(DTPs) survive exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other anti-neoplastics in a non-proliferative,
quiescent (dormant) state via reversible, non-genetic mechanisms. DTPs are implicated in resistance of
EGFRmut non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BRAFmut melanoma, and other cancers, but a potential role in
in HER2+ BC had not been explored thoroughly. We found that HER2+ BC lines treated with HER2-TKIs
(lapatinib, tucatinib) give rise to two types of DTPs, which have luminal or mesenchymal transcriptomes. As
in other cell lines, a fraction of HER2+ BC cells transit stochastically through G0 after exiting mitosis, instead
of proceeding directly into G1. Remarkably, luminal DTPs arose uniquely from these transient G0 cells (“pre-
DTPs”), which also express a subset of DTP genes. HER2+ BCs are highly proliferative, yet like other tumors,
they also have significant numbers of G0 (Ki67-) cells, and our initial analyses of samples from TKI-treated
HER2+ BC patients comport with DTP generation from G0 cells. Thus, in contrast to current models, which
contend that the drug-tolerant, quiescent state is induced by TKIs and other targeted
therapies/chemotherapies, our data indicate that pre-DTPs might already be present in the drug-naïve
population.
 We hypothesize that the chromatin of such transient, G0/pre-DTP cells has a globally distinct
organization that primes them to induce the complete DTP transcriptome and become drug-tolerant upon
TKI exposure. Whether this “G0 selection/induction” model applies to mesenchymal-like HER2+ DTPs, DTPs
induced by other agents, and/or more broadly to bona fide HER2 tumors remains unclear. Because DTPs
comprise a potential cellular reservoir for seeding stable resistance to HER2 TKIs and other
targeted/conventional therapies, delineating their ontogenetic mechanisms could reveal novel cancer
vulnerabilities and ultimately, new therapies. Our focus on the unique features of gene regulation in G0 cells
could also have implications for tumor dormancy. This proposal joins experts in epigenetics/chromosome
organization (SKOK) and cancer biology/cell signaling (NEEL) to address these timely, relevant questions
Specifically, we will: (1) Characterize chromatin architecture and gene regulation in HER2-TKI pre-DTPs and
DTPs from luminal-like HER2+ BC lines, (2) Test the hypothesis that HER2-TKI DTPs from mesenchymal
HER2+ BC lines also arise from G0-like pre-DTPs and have condensin II-organized chromatin, and (3) Test
the pathophysiological significance of lapatinib DTPs in in vivo models of HER2-TKI DTPs."
10757422,"Vascular insufficiency underlies the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID). The pathological events in VCID involves crosstalk between the CNS and peripheral
metabolic regulation, yet the details in bridging two compartments are underexplored. To fill this
gap, the present proposal focuses on the impact of the adiponectin in the progression of VCID.
Adiponectin is an adipokine mainly produced by adipocytes and secreted into the bloodstream,
regulating glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Using a mouse model of chronic cerebral
hypoperfusion-induced VCID by asymmetric common carotid artery stenosis (ACAS), we found
that adiponectin levels increased in plasma 3d to 42d after ACAS, yet were suppressed in
cerebrospinal fluid at 42d after ACAS. We obtained further promising data showing that 1)
Adiponectin knockout (KO) mice exhibited more prominent cognitive deficits up to 42d after ACAS,
whereas administration of adipoRon, a small-molecule agonist of adiponectin receptor (adipoR),
rescued long-term cognitive functions in adiponectin KO mice and attenuated cognitive deficits in
wild-type mice; 2) Adiponectin KO exacerbated, while adipoRon treatment improved long-term
white matter structural and functional integrity; 3) Adiponectin receptors AdipoR1/R2 were highly
expressed on endothelial cells (ECs); 4) Adiponectin KO exacerbated the reduction in cortical
cerebral blood flow (CBF) after ACAS; 5) AdipoRon promotes endothelial nitric oxide synthase
activation in cultured EC; 6) AdipoRon reduced blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage in vivo after
ACAS and protected from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced hyperpermeability in an in
vitro BBB model. 7) AdipoRon treatment inhibited neuroinflammation after ACAS and inhibited
the release of inflammatory factors from primary EC upon OGD. The current proposal will further
explore the effects of adiponectin on endothelial function in ACAS, including vasoactivity, BBB
integrity, and EC inflammation and will develop in vivo adipoRon regimen as a novel strategy to
preserve white matter and improve cognitive function. The central hypothesis is that adiponectin
ameliorates cognitive deficits and white matter injury in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-
induced VCID at least in part by enhancing endothelial-dependent vasoactivity and BBB
integrity. Aim 1. Test if adiponectin improves endothelial-dependent vasoactivity and CBF by
enhancing vascular production of nitric oxide following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced
VCID. Aim 2. Test if adiponectin inhibits endothelial inflammation and protects the BBB integrity
against hypoperfusion-induced injury. Aim 3. Test if adipoRon treatment maintains white matter
integrity and long-term neurological functions after ACAS in young and aged mice of both sexes."

The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes the AIDS-defining B cell malignancy, primary
effusion lymphoma (PEL). KSHV is found in all tumor cells and is tightly latent in >95% of infected cells. Latency
is an intricately organized program that highly restricts gene expression to a handful of genes (i.e. latency genes).
PEL cell lines require these latency genes to be constitutively expressed while the lytic genes are silenced for
survival. Thus, both expression of the latency genes and maintenance of the latency program are critical for PEL
cells. However, the contributions of most viral genes to the survival and proliferation of PEL-derived cell lines
are unknown. Our long-term goal is to accelerate our understanding of the biology of this AIDS-defining
lymphoma by comprehensively analyzing viral factors required for PEL tumor cell survival. We, therefore,
performed an RNA-targeting CRISPR/CasRx tiled screen to identify KSHV transcripts required for the survival
of PEL cells. Our results reveal that the left-hand origin of lytic replication (OriLytL) encodes a previously
unannotated RNA critical for the survival of PEL cell lines. The OriLytL serves as one of two initiation sites crucial
for viral DNA replication during reactivation from latency. In this lytic phase, the OriLytL produces two long
noncoding RNAs required for lytic viral DNA replication. However, our data suggest that the latency-specific
OriLytL (OriLytLlat) RNA is distinct and functions differently from the lytic OriLytL RNAs. Our central hypothesis
is that the OriLytLlat RNA acts to maintain the latency program. Since latency is crucial for the survival of tumor
cells, the OriLytLlat RNA is a critical oncogenic driver of KSHV-associated cancers. The over-all objective is to
characterize this latency-specific OriLytLlat RNA and determine its role in latency maintenance in PEL. In Aim 1,
we will characterize the latent viral transcriptome, including the full-length OriLytLlat RNA using long-read RNA
sequencing. In Aim 2, we will define the role of the OriLytLlat RNA in the recruitment of chromatin binding factors
and resulting epigenetic changes in the viral genome that contribute to establish and maintain the latency
program. Together, this work will provide a new model on how viral latency is influenced by a latent RNA from
the lytic origin of replication. Importantly, our studies will also shed light on the biology of other KSHV-associated
malignancies, including Kaposi’s sarcoma."

The health of persons with HIV (PWH) has improved with the expanded use of effective antiretroviral therapy.
Despite these improvements, the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) for PWH remains up
to twice as high as for those without HIV. PWH bear a high burden of ASCVD risk factors such dyslipidemia
and diabetes mellitus, which is increasing as PWH live longer. Statins have proven efficacy to prevent ASCVD.
PWH have a greater statin need but lower rates of adequate response to statins than those without HIV, in
large part due to nonadherence. There is a need for patient-centered interventions for improving statin
adherence that adequately incorporate PWH-specific barriers, such as HIV stigma, low ASCVD risk perception,
HIV treatment vs. ASCVD prevention prioritization, and pill fatigue and drug interaction fears from antiretroviral
therapy. The objective of this K01 grant is to adapt an intervention promoting statin adherence from the general
population to PWH and evaluate the adapted intervention’s acceptability and feasibility in an HIV clinic. We
hypothesize that STIC2IT (Study of a Tele-pharmacy Intervention for Chronic diseases to Improve Treatment
adherence, “Stick to it”) can be adapted to PWH. STIC2IT is a pharmacist-delivered intervention proven in the
general population to improve chronic medication adherence including to statins, via motivational interviewing
and tailored resources to reduce adherence barriers. We will analyze existing data from the Centers for AIDS
Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) and conduct in-depth interviews of PWH in the
University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV Clinical Cohort (UCHCC). We will use interview
findings to adapt the intervention and pilot it in the UCHCC. This career development award will provide the PI
with training in: 1) qualitative research methods; 2) intervention adaptation and evaluation; and 3) ASCVD
prevention and epidemiology. The PI will be closely guided by an interdisciplinary mentoring team of experts in
health behavior, epidemiology, cardiology, HIV care, and intervention trials. The Specific Aims are: 1) Among
PWH, identify contemporary longitudinal patterns of statin use and effectiveness, and patient groups at greater
risk of suboptimal statin use; 2) Systematically adapt the STIC2IT intervention to the needs and preferences of
PWH; and 3) Evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention in an HIV clinic. Carrying out
these research aims will reinforce training activities and leverage the PI’s existing skills in HIV, clinical
epidemiology, and pharmacoepidemiology studies using large, electronic health records-based clinical cohorts.
The study will produce preliminary data for future study planning and a prototype adapted intervention ready to
be evaluated for efficacy in R-level grants. This award will support the PI’s career goal of becoming an
independent investigator at the forefront of innovative research to improve ASCVD prevention for PWH."

CMT type 1 is a demyelinating peripheral
neuropathy characterized by reduced motor nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/s) and segmental
demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy. Despite the different subtypes of
CMT associated with distinct genetic causes and pathogenetic mechanisms, all forms of CMT1 eventually
converge on the loss of myelinated nerve fibers. Thus, a common approach based on enhancing myelination in
diseased nerves without exacerbating myelin damages must be identified to provide widely effective therapy for
the array of CMT neuropathies.
 We previously showed that enhancing axonal NRG1tIII signaling increases fatty acid levels in myelin,
improves myelination and nerve function in mouse models for inherited demyelinating neuropathy, through an
alternative EGR2-independent pathway. Notably, we found that PMP2, a fatty acid-binding protein is uniquely
up-regulated downstream NRG1tIII overexpression in Schwann cells. Our central hypothesis of this proposal is
that overexpression of the fatty acid-binding protein PMP2 is a downstream promyelinating mediator of NRG1tIII-
mediated hypermyelination and that sustained overexpression of PMP2 is sufficient to improve myelin formation,
without exacerbating myelin damages. We have now compelling preliminary evidence that PMP2
overexpression in Schwann cells enhances the uptake of fatty acid, increases ATP production, and is beneficial
to Schwann cell myelination and remyelination. Thus, we propose to determine if PMP2 overexpression is a
suitable strategy to improve myelination defects in inherited peripheral demyelinating neuropathy (P0S63del),
which of PMP2 functions are beneficial to improve myelin formation, and how Pmp2 expression is being
regulated. The new mechanistic insights on PMP2 overexpression enhancing myelination we will gain from this
work are in line with NINDS objective seeking fundamental knowledge about the nervous system that may
facilitate the development of future interventions to reduce the disease burden in patients with peripheral

10763392,"Pathological Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia characterized by memory loss and
aggregation of insoluble beta amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Memories are stored at synapses, and it is
thought that an early driver of dementia may be synapse pruning occurring even before plaque deposition.
Extensive activity-dependent synaptic pruning also occurs during developmental critical periods when learning
and experience strengthen and stabilize actively used synapses, while others weaken and are pruned. In an
unbiased in vivo screen for genes regulated by neural activity during visual system development, my lab made
the unexpected discovery that specific Major Histocompatibility Class I (MHCI) molecules, famous for their
immune system roles, are expressed in neurons and at synapses. Next, we identified an innate immune MHCI
receptor expressed in neurons: PirB (Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B). Functional studies in mice reveal
that the MHCI - PirB axis is required for synapse pruning during normal development. Genetic deletion of PirB
selectively in cortical pyramidal neurons, or pharmacologic blockade using a recombinant protein, rapidly
generates new spines and functional synapses even in adult cerebral cortex. In the APP/PS1 transgenic model
of autosomal dominant AD, mice lacking PirB are protected from memory loss at 9 months of age despite high
levels of beta amyloid. Remarkably, PirB is a receptor for soluble beta amyloid oligomers, with high affinity
saturable binding. This interaction hyperactivates cofilin signaling which drives actin depolymerization and
contributes to synapse pruning in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model. In human the LilrB (leukocyte immunoglobulin-
like receptor B) family of 5 related molecules are PirB homologs. Similar to PirB, LilrB1 and LilrB2 are known to
bind MHCI ligands, including HLA-A, B and C alleles, which are implicated in human GWAS and gene expression
studies of AD. We discovered that LilrB2 binds soluble beta amyloid oligomers with nanomolar affinity, and LilrB2
protein is expressed in human frontal lobe. A crystal structure of the interaction between beta amyloid and LilrB2
has been solved, confirming genuine structural interactions and pointing to novel drug targets for AD. A major
goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that innate immune signaling via MHCI-PirB/LilrB at the synapse is
disrupted by pathological oAbeta, and to connect observations in mice to human neurobiology by (1) studying
MHCI-PirB dependent signaling in neurons using RiboTag cell type- specific transcription profiling in AD model
mice, and (2) by identifying and studying the function of human homologs, the HLA Class I and LilrB receptor
families, in 3-dimensional forebrain organoids derived from human iPSCs, followed by validation in brain samples.
Results from these studies will build a bridge between mouse models of AD and human neurons. They should
also provide mechanistic information about how nervous and immune systems communicate at the synapse and
open up new therapeutic avenues for treating synapse pruning disorders in development and in Alzheimer’s
disease."

 Marmosets, squirrel monkeys, and owl monkeys are New World Monkeys (NWM) studied extensively in
a broad array of research areas, including infection, vision, audition, social behavior, cognition,
neurodegenerative diseases, reproduction, and genetic manipulation. One critical shortcoming of the NWM
animal models is the limited number of immunological reagents that are currently available due to more than
33 million of years of evolutionary divergence. This scarcity of research tools reduces the translational value of
these nonhuman primates. The goal of this R24 application is to remedy this deficiency by generating
antibodies and validating immunological assays that identify important NWM biomarkers of inflammation and
metabolism, for which there is currently lack of reagents. Inflammation is a common process involved in aging,
obesity, and pathologies such as infectious diseases, multiple sclerosis, and age-related neurodegenerative
disorders, all of which are being modeled in these species. The NWM inflammatory biomarkers to be produced
include C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10
(CXCL10, IP-10), granzyme B, and the surface glycoprotein CD69. Gastrointestinal hormones to be produced,
critical for validation of studies of metabolic syndrome, include insulin, adiponectin, and leptin. In order to
accomplish our goal, we have assembled a team of scientists from academic and research institutions and a
biotechnology company specialized in the production of reagents of veterinary and human use. We will
produce NWM proteins in eukaryotic cells, and use the recombinant marmoset proteins to produce monoclonal
antibodies (mMabs) in mice (Specific Aim 1). We will then use the marmoset recombinant proteins to identify
epitope specificity of these mAbs, select the ones that also recognize squirrel monkey and owl monkey
homologues, and identify optimal antibody pairs for techniques such as ELISA, ELISPOT, Luminex, and
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays (SA 2). Finally, these immunological assays will be validated with
samples obtained from plasma aliquots from NWM exposed to transient metabolic and inflammatory
challenges, and from ex vivo stimulated NWM cells (SA 3). At the end of this project, researchers working in
different NWM models of human disease will have access to research tools for improved validation of their
preclinical models. A resource website will be developed to disseminate the availability of reagents, to track the
impact of these reagents in biomedical studies, and to distribute protocols and SOPs. Development of these
reagents is of trans-NIH interest, will increase the translational value of marmoset, squirrel monkey and owl
monkey modles, and will expand the scientific data obtained from these animals."

endometrium like tissue in sites outside the uterine cavity. Approximately 6-10% of women have endometriosis
and suffer from symptoms including chronic pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, infertility, and other co-
morbidities associated with systemic inflammation. The widespread nature of this disease extends to impact
overall health, including contributing to elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) --the leading cause of
death in women. Endometriosis and atherosclerotic CVD are both inflammation-induced diseases. Estrogen
exposure is beneficial for women from a CVD standpoint, but the standard of treatment for endometriosis
includes estrogen suppression. This creates a conundrum for the long-term management of CVD risk in women
with endometriosis. This proposal fills a significant gap in prior research into the role of inflammatory signaling,
CVD risk and effective interventions to mitigate cardiovascular comorbidities. Circulating oxidized lipids and
inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in women with endometriosis stimulate the ubiquitously expressed
scavenger lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1) on the vasculature resulting in pronounced endothelial
dysfunction, one of the earliest detectable indicators of increased CVD risk. Estrogen directly inhibits LOX-1-
dependent endothelial dysfunction and thus the standards of care for endometriosis treatment may be
exacerbating CVD risk. Our working model is that endometriosis-associated systemic inflammatory mediators
increase LOX-1 receptor activity and result in endothelial dysfunction. Our global hypothesis is that in women
with endometriosis increased CVD risk is the result chronic systemic inflammation inducing endothelial
dysfunction, mediated through LOX-1 receptor, and this CVD risk is exacerbated by standard estrogen
suppression treatments. In this application, we use a multipronged approach including in vivo and ex vivo human
physiological experiments to determine the role of inflammation and estrogen suppression on cardiovascular
specific outcomes in the setting of endometriosis. This series of studies in women with endometriosis will
delineate the roles of estradiol (Specific Aim 1) and systemic inflammation (Specific Aim 2) in endometriosis-
associated accelerated CVD risk. These studies will evaluate novel signaling mechanisms including the linkage
common to both CVD and endometriosis through the downstream activation of the ubiquitous scavenger receptor
LOX-1. We will also test the effects of two distinct interventions (Specific Aim 3) including the selective estrogen
receptor modulator bazedoxifene, and the statin simvastatin in mitigating CVD risk in women with endometriosis.
Our studies have the potential to identify clinically relevant therapeutic targets and interventions thus decreasing

includes estrogen suppression. This creates a conundrum for the long-term management of CVD risk in women
with endometriosis. This proposal fills a significant gap in prior research into the role of inflammatory signaling,
CVD risk and effective interventions to mitigate cardiovascular comorbidities. Circulating oxidized lipids and
inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in women with endometriosis stimulate the ubiquitously expressed
scavenger lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1) on the vasculature resulting in pronounced endothelial
dysfunction, one of the earliest detectable indicators of increased CVD risk. Estrogen directly inhibits LOX-1-
dependent endothelial dysfunction and thus the standards of care for endometriosis treatment may be
exacerbating CVD risk. Our working model is that endometriosis-associated systemic inflammatory mediators
increase LOX-1 receptor activity and result in endothelial dysfunction. Our global hypothesis is that in women
with endometriosis increased CVD risk is the result chronic systemic inflammation inducing endothelial
dysfunction, mediated through LOX-1 receptor, and this CVD risk is exacerbated by standard estrogen
suppression treatments. In this application, we use a multipronged approach including in vivo and ex vivo human
physiological experiments to determine the role of inflammation and estrogen suppression on cardiovascular
specific outcomes in the setting of endometriosis. This series of studies in women with endometriosis will
delineate the roles of estradiol (Specific Aim 1) and systemic inflammation (Specific Aim 2) in endometriosis-
associated accelerated CVD risk. These studies will evaluate novel signaling mechanisms including the linkage
common to both CVD and endometriosis through the downstream activation of the ubiquitous scavenger receptor
LOX-1. We will also test the effects of two distinct interventions (Specific Aim 3) including the selective estrogen
receptor modulator bazedoxifene, and the statin simvastatin in mitigating CVD risk in women with endometriosis.
Our studies have the potential to identify clinically relevant therapeutic targets and interventions thus decreasing
CVD burden in women with endometriosis."
10876387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application seeks to understand how circadian rhythms control T cell immunity to influenza infection
through signals delivered by the sympathetic nervous system. Circadian rhythms are biological clocks that are
entrained by light/dark cycles, and in mammals, those rhythms are synchronized systemically throughout the
body via signals delivered by sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. Our recent studies uncovered an
unexpected role for the β2-adrenergic receptor in cytolytic responses of CD8+ T cells to a virus infection.
Further, we found that selective deletion of the Adrb2 on CD8+ T cells profoundly disrupted circadian gene
expression and oscillation frequencies as a function of light/dark entrainment. This proposal will test the
hypothesis that the signaling through the ADRB2 in CD8+ T cells regulates circadian rhythm genes, and that
those genes are required for orchestrated T cell responses to influenza infection. Aim 1 will distinguish the roles
of the Adrb2 and downstream core clock in CD8-mediated lung inflammation during influenza infection. Aim 2
will determine how jet-lag impacts CD8+ T cell responses to influenza. This proposal tests a very straight-
forward hypothesis, which if supported, will be the first to connect a circadian rhythm entrainment receptor to
downstream T cells responses to influenza. The outcomes of this research will significantly advance our
understanding of environmental pathways that regulate immune responses to influenza and improve mouse
models of viral pathogenesis and vaccine design."
10745324,"Complementary to efforts supported by this grant that led to the characterization of the first signaling
fatty acid primary amide, its hydrolysis and signaling termination by and discovery of fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH), and the validation of FAAH as a therapeutic target modulating the activity of endocannabinoids, we will
target additional serine hydrolases that regulate the release or degradation of these key signaling fatty acid-
derived endocannabinoids (i.e., anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG)). With the concerns surrounding
the use of COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of chronic pain, the liabilities of opioids (respiratory depression,
desensitization with chronic dosing, dependence, constipation), and the challenges of promoting direct
cannabinoid use (catalepsy, hypomotility, hypothermia, dependence), interest in therapeutic targeting of the
endocannabinoid system is now intense. Rather than blunt force targeting of the signaling receptors (CB1 and
CB2), the modulation of the release or termination of the endocannabinoid signaling molecules has emerged as
an especially attractive therapeutic approach that avoids cannabinoid side effects by only potentiating active
signaling at their needed sites of action. This development is largely the result of our studies and those of our
collaborators with whom we discovered and characterized FAAH, and for which we provided the first inhibitors
that were sufficiently efficacious in vivo to validate the target for the treatment of pain without the characteristic
cannabinoid or opioid side effects. Our continued efforts will define therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of
pain and inflammatory disorders by using inhibitors of additional enzymes regulating the signaling of
endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-AG), targeting dual FAAH/MAGL inhibitors, selective MAGL inhibitors,
and selective DAGL-? inhibitors. In these studies we will continue to create targeted screening libraries for this
major enzyme class and use activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to screen for potent, selective inhibitors of
uncharacterized serine hydrolases for use in identifying their endogenous roles and potential to serve as
therapeutic targets. Central to the science to emerge from our work was the discovery of the presence, and
subsequently the role, of fatty acid amide signaling molecules. Studies continuing to define the site of action and
endogenous role of such fatty acid amide signaling molecules will be conducted, including those targeting
erucamide and arachidonamide."

10745330,"Summary:
 In addition to the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), human connective tissue mast cells (MCTC) express
a recently described G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), known as Mas-related GPCR-X2 (MRGPRX2). Our
lab was the first to demonstrate that host defense antimicrobial peptides (HDPs) activate human mast cells
via MRGPRX2, which likely contributes to innate immunity. Emerging evidence suggests that MRGPRX2-
mediated local mast cell activation clears bacterial infection via the recruitment of neutrophils and promotes
adaptive immunity to control reinfection. However, dysregulation of host defense and excessive generation
of the host defense peptide, LL-37 contributes to the pathogenesis of rosacea. MrgprB2 is the mouse
counterpart of human MRGPRX2 and our preliminary data demonstrated that LL-37-mediated experimental
rosacea is significantly reduced in MrgprB2-/- mice when compared to wild-type mice. MRGPRX2 also serves
as a novel GPCR for neuropeptides such as substance P, hemokinin-1 and pituitary adenylate cyclase-
activating peptide (PACAP). Furthermore, MRGPRX2 is an “atypical opioid receptor” and some of the side
effects opioids are likely mediated via mast cell degranulation through this receptor. However, the molecular
mechanisms involved in the activation and regulation of its downstream signaling remains largely unknown.
 In addition to G proteins, many GPCR agonists also signal via the recruitment of adapter proteins
known as β-arrestins. This pathway not only contributes to GPCR desensitization but also provides a platform
for a variety of G protein-independent signaling. Biased GPCR agonists preferentially activate pathways
mediated by G proteins (G protein-biased) or β-arrestins (β-arrestin-biased). Agonists that activate both
pathways are known as balanced agonists. Recently, we made the surprising observation that while compound
48/80 activates both G protein and β-arrestin (balanced agonist) an angiogenic host defense peptide activates
only G protein but not β-arrestin (G protein-biased agonist). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that
balanced and G protein-biased MRGPRX2 agonists activate mast cells via different mechanisms to
promote distinct biological responses in vivo. Because MrgprB2 is the mouse counterpart of the human
MRGPRX2, we will incorporate this receptor for many of our in vivo studies. In aim #1, we will determine which
of the known mast cell secretagogues (HDPs, neuropeptides, opioids and FDA-approved pseudo-allergic
drugs) act as balanced and G protein-biased agonists for MRGPRX2. We will also identify the structural
determinants on the receptor that facilitate their coupling to G protein and β-arrestins. In aim #2, we will
modulate host defense, pseudo-allergy and rosacea by targeting MRGPRX2/MrgprB2’s balanced/G protein
biased signaling in mast cells in vivo. In aim #3, we will determine the roles of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 on
MRGPRX2 and MrgprB2-mediated signaling in vitro and biological responses in vivo. Completion of this study
will provide novel approaches to modulate MRGPRX2-mediated host defense and inflammatory diseases."
10745332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Biological tissues appear to “know” their intended final sizes and achieve them precisely and robustly. While,
in principle, a simple negative signaling feedback should be sufficient to explain how a given stem cell lineage
regulates its cellular outputs, in reality it cannot work because most tissues are physically large, with stem cells
and their progeny spread out over centimeter-scale distances. How tissues overcome the microscopic decay
limits of diffusible molecular signals to breach distances orders-of-magnitude in spatial scale remains elusive.
 This application is inspired by our serendipitous discovery that FGF and BMP mutant mice are able to grow
super-long and highly imprecise hairs that can exceed the length of normal mouse hairs by 7-fold. Our lineage
analyses suggest that hair stem cells continuously replenish short-lived transit-amplifying (TA) cells spatially
located nearly 1 cm away from the stem cells. Interestingly, our single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses reveal
previously unappreciated heterogeneity of the intermediate epithelial progenitor cells physically located between
the stem and TA cells.
 Through an integrated mathematical and experimental approach, this application will focus on testing
our new hypothesis that dynamic equilibrium between two or more intermediate cell states and their associated
cell-cell communications enable feedback information propagation over large spatial scale from TA cells to stem
cells to regulate the new progenitor cell production for hair size control. The first aim of the proposed research
is to profile and quantify the heterogeneity of intermediate epithelial progenitors, and computationally and
experimentally determine the functional link between specific intermediate progenitor states in the hair follicle
and the hair length and its precision. The second aim is to define the cell-cell communication networks within the
epithelial hair follicle lineage, and computationally and experimentally establish how multiple short-range
signaling activities coordinate to form a long-range feedback mechanism that controls progenitor flux between
distant stem and TA cell compartments for proper hair growth. The third aim is to determine the signaling impact
of mesenchymal niche cells, which surround the hair follicle, on the epithelial lineage cells for hair size control.
 The study premise is based on novel and extensive preliminary experimental and computational data. The
proposed studies are significant because they will establish new long-range signaling mechanisms and
uncover novel roles of intermediate cell states in tissue size control. The proposed studies are innovative
because they will establish new experimental models for studying tissue size regulation using super-long and
extra-short hair mutant mice and will result in numerous new genetic mouse tools for epithelial stem cell research.
They will also result in several novel mathematical and computational tools for analyzing single-cell RNA-
sequencing data and new spatial models for complex cell lineages, such as in the hair follicle."
10763814,"The primary objectives of this research project are to characterize a new immune checkpoint and
to develop a new immunotherapeutic strategy to treat cancer. Immunotherapy that targets
lymphoid cell checkpoints holds great promise for curing cancer. However, a majority of cancer
patients do not respond to this form of therapy. In addition to lymphoid cells, myeloid cells play
essential roles in controlling immunity to cancer. Whether myeloid checkpoints exist that can be
targeted to treat cancer is not well established. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a
newly identified population of leukocytes important for cancer. Depletion of MDSCs leads to
markedly enhanced anti-tumor immunity in mice, and may be crucial for the success of cancer
immunotherapy in humans. Despite their significance in cancer, MDSCs remain to be the least
understood subset of myeloid cells. It is unclear what transcriptional program specifies MDSC
differentiation; it is unknown what pharmaceutical approach can be used to target MDSCs for the
treatment of cancer. This grant application is inspired by our recent discovery that the transcription
factor c-Rel is required for both human and murine MDSC development and/or function, and that
c-Rel inhibitors are effective for treating cancer in mice. The goals of this project are to (i) elucidate
the mechanisms through which c-Rel regulates murine and human MDSCs, and (ii) establish the
efficacy and the mechanisms of action of our c-Rel inhibitors for the treatment of cancer."
10914266,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People with HIV (PWH) have a heightened coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse event risk even after
controlling for traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Hence, there is an unmet need for improved CV risk
stratification among PWH. HIV infection is associated with increased systemic immune activation and
inflammation that is not part of the traditional CV risk assessment. Importantly, work to date in PWH has been
limited to evaluating systemic inflammatory biomarkers or utilizing functional imaging assessments of vascular
inflammation at vessels larger than the coronary arteries. Assessing large vessels prevents direct assessment
of the local coronary inflammatory milieu that drives the development of coronary plaques. Nevertheless,
recent advances in cardiac computed tomography (CT), specifically assessing the density of peri-coronary
adipose tissue (PCAT) that directly surrounds the coronary arteries, suggest that PCAT density may be an
accurate non-invasive index of coronary artery inflammation. In the proposed study, we will leverage data
obtained from the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE), in which we have shown
high rates of vulnerable plaque, in association with key systemic inflammatory markers, among asymptomatic
PWH on ART, with only low to moderate traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. We
will first assess the relationship of coronary inflammation to critical cardiac CT and deep immune phenotyping
parameters, including noncalcified plaque volume, obtained in the mechanistic substudy of REPRIEVE. We will
further leverage the trial design, encompassing a randomized treatment trial of statin therapy and serial
assessments of CTA parameters to assess the natural history of coronary inflammation and plaque and the
key effects of statin therapy in PWH. Specifically, we will analyze the unique relation of coronary inflammation,
measured as PCAT density, to coronary plaque development and changes in plaque composition in
relationship to other CV risk factors, the effects of statins on coronary inflammation in relation to changes in
plaque volume, and the relationship to MACE in exploratory analyses. Successful completion of this study will
inform the field of the critical, independent role of coronary inflammation in the development of coronary plaque
in PWH and determine for the first time whether a reduction in coronary inflammation contributes to statin-
related effects on plaque parameters in this population. Data from this grant, leveraging a key ASCVD
prevention trial, will thus inform the development of more targeted CV risk reduction strategies among PWH."
10764100,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
 Osteoporosis, obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are public health hazards that affect millions of older
adults. Despite crippling consequences, their therapeutic armamentarium pales when compared with diseases
of similar magnitudes, such as diabetes and cancer. Our current U19 AG060917 and the ADRD supplement
have allowed us to create a highly collaborative transdisciplinary translational research program that
spans bone biology, metabolism and the neurosciences. The program builds on rigorous and transparent
research, born from a longstanding collaboration between Drs. Mone Zaidi and Clifford Rosen, wherein data
continues to be contemporaneously replicated in both labs. We have together identified the fertility hormone
FSH as a unique target to prevent osteoporosis, obesity and AD. We have developed antibodies that block the
action of FSH and, in doing so, prevent bone loss, obesity, and cognitive decline in mouse models1-4. We have
now created a therapeutic antibody—MS-Hu6—which has undergone early stage testing, including safety
studies in monkeys5,6—and, is therefore poised for efficacy testing in aging models of human disease. This is
particularly relevant as elderly women in the AGES–Reykjavik cohort show a correlation between a high serum
FSH, low bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk7. We have also unmasked a novel action of the second
gonadotropin LH in reducing body fat—raising the question whether the leanness induced by a small molecule
LH receptor agonist, ORG43553, can synergize with FSH blockade by MS-Hu6. Four projects will thus focus
on both mechanism and translation. In Project 1, we will examine if FSH blockade by MS-Hu6 or genetic Fshr
ablation in aged mice can reverse established osteoporosis, obesity and/or AD. Project 2 will use Cre lines to
delete the Fshr in specific bone cells—osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts—as well as in adipocytes and
examine the evolution of the respective phenotypes. This will be complemented by siRNA–mediated Fshr
knockdown in hypothalamic neurons that might contribute to obesity. Project 3 will likewise probe the
mechanism of action of LHCGR agonism on body fat, and specifically determine interactions between
downstream signals by using chemical inhibitors and in vivo genetic epistasis. Project 4 remains as the
program's epidemiological arm, which will utilize validated datasets from AGES–Reykjavik to probe
relationships between brain health and bone health, and examine, using a case–cohort design, whether high
serum FSH levels are associated with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The Projects will be supported by
three overarching Cores, namely a Skeletal, Metabolic and Neurobehavioral Core (Core A), an Antibody
Production and Testing Core (Core B), and an Administrative, Biostatistics and Good Laboratory Practice
(GLP) Management Core (Core C). In sum, our U19 renewal should allow us to break new ground in
understanding the role of pituitary gonadotropins in the pathogenesis of three prevalent disorders of aging, in
addition to moving our two lead therapeutics, MS-Hu6 and ORG43553 into the clinic."

This proposal is for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for Scott Baliban, Ph.D. Training:
My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in systems vaccinology, focusing on defining
the elements that support protective immune responses to pediatric bacterial infections and using this knowledge
to predict infection and vaccination outcomes. My current research expertise involves developing mouse models
of bacterial infectious disease and exploring functional and protective aspects of vaccine-induced antibody
responses. This application presents a five-year career development program meant to expand my vaccinology
toolkit with new areas of expertise in bioinformatics and computational biology. Specifically, I will receive training
in analyzing rich and complex data sets using multi-omics data integration and machine learning. My mentoring
and advising team are experts in all areas of my proposed research, and I have designed a rigorous training
plan that will ensure my success throughout the award. Research: The global rise in pediatric infections caused
by invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis has created an urgent public
health crisis. We have developed novel glycoconjugate vaccines consisting of the iNTS surface polysaccharide
(core-O-polysaccharide [COPS]) linked to the flagellar monomer protein (FliC). COPS:FliC conjugates are
immunogenic and protective in animal models; however, less is known about the mechanisms that support
successful immunization as well as the in vivo effector function of protective vaccine-induced antibodies. My
preliminary data demonstrate that infant mice respond sub-optimally to COPS:FliC immunization as compared
to adult vaccine recipients and that COPS:FliC-induced antibodies are sufficient for robust protection against
lethal iNTS challenge. In Aim 1, using S. Enteritidis COPS:FliC as an exemplar conjugate vaccine, I will build a
predictive model of vaccine responsiveness based on both gene expression and metabolite perturbations after
vaccination. In Aim 2, I will decipher the in vivo functionality of human anti-COPS:FliC antibodies using the infant
mouse model of fatal iNTS challenge. Outlook: This study will identify vaccine-induced molecular pathways that
correlate with COPS:FliC vaccination outcomes. It will also establish the in vivo importance of specific antibody
effector functions for protection against in infant mice. These findings will support an R01 application where I will
derive more accurate predictive models of COPS:FliC response quality by assessing the temporal dynamics of
metabolomic and transcriptomic responses to vaccination in mice. This approach will be extended to S.
Typhimurium COPS:FliC conjugates, and ultimately the predictive models will be verified in vaccinated human
infants. I will also investigate mechanistic antibody correlates of protection in the infant mouse model with the
goal of developing serological assays to measure anti-microbial functions. At the completion of the K01, I will be
uniquely positioned for an independent career where I will apply systems vaccinology approaches to develop
novel conceptual frameworks for infant immunology and the vaccination process."

Scientific summary:
The 5-HT2-serotonin family of receptors represents essential drug targets for most atypical
antipsychotics as well as drugs useful in treating obesity, sleep disorders, psychosis and autistic-
spectrum disorders. It is currently unknown how these drugs interact with their target receptors. Here
we aim to obtain high resolution structures of 5-HT2-family receptors bound to various transducers (G
proteins and arrestins) and biased and unbiased agonists. We will use these structures to prosecute
ultra-large-scale docking campaigns (up to 15 billion novel compounds) to discover improved chemical
tools for these receptors.
These studies are both innovative technically and conceptually by providing an unprecedented
understanding of the molecular and atomic details responsible for psychoactive drug actions.
Additionally, models which attempt to explain ligand-specific properties of biased signaling from the
perspective of ligand-receptor interactions will be tested by a combination of direct structural studies,
molecular modeling, docking, site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies. We anticipate that
our studies will reveal key ligand-receptor interactions essential for biased signaling for serotonin
receptors. Elucidating the molecular details for such interactions provides a
template for the structure-guided design of novel therapeutics."
10768511,"SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to identify functional metabolic changes in adult neural stem cells during aging,
with the objective of `reprogramming' chromatin and transcriptional states in old stem cells and rejuvenate their
function. The adult brain contains regenerative neurogenic niches that comprise neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs
can give rise to new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and contribute to aspects of learning and memory
as well as injury repair. During aging, the ability of NSCs to generate new neurons decline dramatically.
Interestingly, neurogenic decline can be reversed at least in part by `rejuvenating interventions' (e.g. diet and
exercise), raising the exciting possibility that specific mechanisms can boost regenerative niches to counter
aging. While some mechanisms underlying NSC decline have been identified, a systematic characterization of
the program that regulate regenerative neurogenic regions during aging has been elusive. Identifying how
metabolic changes impacts neurogenic niche aging and how metabolic interventions `reprogram' chromatin and
transcriptional states will be critical to design efficient molecular strategies to slow the functional deterioration of
regenerative niches and enhance the repair potential of the nervous system during aging.
We have recently performed large scale CRISPR-Cas9 functional screens in vitro and in vivo in old NSCs, which
unbiasedly identified glucose metabolism as a critical way to boost old NSC function during aging. In parallel,
our lab has embarked on a systematic effort to identify the reversible changes in the epigenome, transcriptome
and metabolome in neurogenic regions during aging, at both single cell and spatial resolution. Our central
hypothesis is that boosting the metabolic states of old NSCs could reprogram chromatin and transcriptional
states to rejuvenate the function of old neurogenic region. We propose the following experiments:
1. To identify the mechanisms by which manipulating glucose metabolism boosts old neural stem cells by
 impacting their chromatin and transcriptional states in collaboration with Project 1, Core B, and Core C;
2. To use `aging clocks' based on single cell RNA-seq to test in a scalable manner the impact of metabolic
 interventions on specific cell types in old stem cell niches in synergy with Projects 1 and 3 and Core C;
3. To examine the spatial relationship between metabolic and chromatin/transcription states in cells from the
 neurogenic niche in young, old, and rejuvenated individuals in collaboration with Core B.
This project has major implications for countering brain aging and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease."
10768512,"Summary
Aging human tissues have recently been shown to nearly universally experience clonal evolution, in which their
genetic diversity plummets due to selective expansion of specific clones driven by particular somatic mutations.
In the hematopoietic system, clonal evolution (or “clonal hematopoiesis” (CH)) has been associated with an
increased risk for hematologic malignancies, but also acceleration of other non-hematologic aging-associated
diseases. How circulating blood cells derived from aberrant hematopoietic stem cell clones impacts the
function of distal tissues and promotes disease is largely unknown. Overall, this project aims to establish the
mouse as a model for natural clonal hematopoiesis, and to begin to examine the mechanisms through which
CH impacts distal tissues in the context of the most common CH driver- reduced function of DNA
Methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A). Our preliminary data from three distinct mouse strains demonstrates that
expansion of clones indicative of natural CH can be observed in mice above 2 years of age, with the most
common variants overlapping with those in humans. Here this observation will be extensively verified by testing
for CH in mice of multiple ages and under different conditions in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2. We will
also determine clone expansion kinetics by serial sampling, and the effect on clones of specific perturbations.
This Aim will establish the mouse as the first experimental model for natural clonal hematopoiesis and reveal
conditions which enhance or slow its development. Additionally, we will engraft Dnmt3a-mutant cells into
murine recipients to mimic CH, and examine the impact on function of distal tissues and their resident stem
cells in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2. Using single cell sequencing and tissue-proteomics, we will
determine the identity and activity of donor cells infiltrating tissues. A variety of molecular and functional assays
will also reveal the impact of this “induced” CH on the tissue stem cells. Finally, our preliminary data suggest
aberrant macrophages in the context of CH as a key mediator of the downstream effects of CH. Thus, using
multi-omic approaches and candidate gene modulation, we will determine the mechanisms through which
natural aging and reduced DNMT3A engender biased myeloid development and altered function that in turn
impacts distal tissues. Together, these studies exploit the mouse as a model to study key aspects of CH. Given
that CH is ubiquitous in aging humans, and is associated with a growing list of aging-associated diseases,
understanding how CH impacts broader aspects of tissue and organismal aging, in collaboration with
Projects 1 and 2, will enable us to develop new therapeutic approaches to improve human health-span."
10768536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sleep disturbance is one of the primary complaints of gynecologic cancer survivors, with more than 80% of
survivors reporting sleep difficulties. Sleep disturbance also contributes to worsened health-related quality of
life (HRQOL) and increased symptom burden. Although non-pharmacological interventions for sleep
disturbance have been explored among cancer populations, up to 50% of survivors do not adhere to treatment
recommendations, possibly due to the behaviorally labor-intensive nature thereof. Therefore, there is a need
for more effective and acceptable approaches to improve sleep outcomes in cancer. This application proposes
a career development plan to support Dr. Rina Fox in establishing an independent research program focused
on examining strategies to improve HRQOL and reduce symptom burden among cancer survivors, with
particular consideration for the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in the overall disease experience. Her
career development will be supported by a multidisciplinary group of researchers. Her mentors, Drs. Ong, Rini,
and Zee, are recognized scholars in behavioral sleep medicine, cancer control and survivorship, and circadian
rhythms and biology, respectively. They have lengthy histories of federal funding, multidisciplinary
collaboration, and successful mentorship of trainees who go on to achieve independence. Dr. Fox’s training will
be enhanced by expert consultants who will provide guidance in clinical gynecologic oncology (Dr. Tanner),
biostatistics and optimization methodology (Dr. Siddique), qualitative research methods (Dr. Kaiser), circadian
activity rhythms and execution of sleep-focused research among cancer survivors (Dr. Ancoli-Israel), and
biobehavioral mechanisms of intervention efficacy and psychosocial intervention development specifically
among gynecologic cancer survivors (Dr. Penedo). The aim of this application is to optimize a behavioral
intervention to decrease sleep disturbance (primary outcome), and improve HRQOL and reduce symptom
burden (secondary outcomes) among gynecologic cancer survivors. In Phase I, 15 participants will

restriction, stimulus control, and bright light), and will subsequently complete semi-structured individual
interviews to provide feedback regarding barriers and facilitators to intervention adherence. In Phase II, 80
participants will be randomized to evaluate these intervention components within a 23 full factorial trial design,

10768542,"Hypertensive nephropathy is a common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is the
second leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The prevalence of CKD is
significantly higher than the general population and demonstrate progressive loss of kidney
function over time, more attention to the underlying mechanisms of hypertensive nephropathy
are required. Remodeling of the afferent arterioles and accompanying glomerulosclerosis are
hallmarks of human hypertensive nephropathy. Despite extensive investigation, there remain
gaps in understanding why some hypertensive patients develop ESKD, while others do not.
The molecular pathogenesis of the arteriolar remodeling in hypertensive nephropathy would
provide clues to this susceptibility, but the multiple variables that associate with the human
condition limit the ability to provide definitive conclusions. Insight into the molecular basis of
renal microvascular remodeling may therefore be gained through the study of relevant animal
models, in particular the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat, a well-characterized model of hypertensive
nephropathy. Our previous studies, which are described in detail in this application, uncovered
an intrinsic defect in the structural/functional relationship of the renal microvasculature of SS
rats occurring with increases in blood pressure. Preliminary and published studies revealed that
hypertension rapidly upregulated expression of both matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and
Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2), a potent pro-inflammatory chemokine, in kidney
microvasculature of SS rats. We further confirmed that ED-1-positive macrophages collected
around the microvessels of hypertensive SS rats. Our combined findings support the working
hypothesis that hypertension-induced kidney disease in SS rats is initiated by glomerular
injury mediated by microvascular smooth muscle production of a milieu that promotes
inflammation, remodeling, and autoregulatory impairment (Fig. 1). We propose 2 aims:
Aim 1: Determine the novel mechanisms of renal microvascular remodeling and autoregulatory
 dysfunction in SS rats. Hypothesis: MMP-9 mediates afferent arteriolar remodeling and
 impairment of the myogenic response during the development of hypertension.
 1.1 Assess renal afferent arteriolar remodeling and autoregulatory behavior and smooth
 muscle pathobiology of SSMmp9-/- rats.
 1.2 Describe the role of kidney-specific versus systemic expression of MMP-9 in
 microvascular remodeling using a kidney transplant model.
Aim 2: Define the mechanisms of the renal microvascular inflammatory process on
 hypertensive nephropathy in SS rats. Hypothesis: CCL2 is integrally involved in renal
 microvascular remodeling and autoregulatory impairment in hypertensive SS rats.
 2.1 Describe the role of CCL2 in microvascular inflammation and autoregulation in
 SSCcl2-/- rats.
 2.2 Determine the microvascular mechanism of kidney-specific versus systemic
 expression of CCL2 in hypertensive nephropathy using a model of kidney
transplantation.
By focusing on the molecular pathogenesis of renal microvascular inflammation and remodeling,
impaired autoregulatory response to hypertension and glomerular injury, these studies will
improve understanding of the molecular basis of CKD and ESKD from hypertension."
10768624,"The global impact of malaria remains staggering despite extensive efforts to eradicate the disease. The
devastating situation is largely attributed to and aggravated by the emergence and spread of multidrug-
resistant Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of the deadliest form of malaria. Preventing and delaying
emergence of drug-resistance is an essential goal of antimalarial drug development. Monotherapy and highly
mutable drug targets have each facilitated resistance, and both are undesirable in effective long-term
strategies against multi-drug resistant malaria. The novel chemotype described in this proposal represents a
revolutionary approach. It specifically aims to exploit the strengths of other compounds with ideal traits by
making possible a new combination therapy strategy. Our innovative design addresses an immutable parasite
target and merges intrinsic potency with resistance-counteracting functions in a single molecule. It represents a
novel strategy to expand, enhance, and sustain effective antimalarial drug combinations. Our proposed work in
this application seeks to develop novel, potent, safe, inexpensive, and sustainable antimalarial that can be co-
formulated with other antimalarials in a synergistic combination to treat malaria, thus supporting world-wide
elimination of the disease. The specific goal of this project is to maximize the antimalarial potential of the dual-
function acridone chemotype through structural optimization for potency, synergy, pharmacology and metabolic
stability; to accomplish preclinical assessment of lead candidates that are developed through this program of
research; to evaluate for safety, to investigate the mode of action(s) for these synergistic antimalarial
acridones, and to explore the propensity for drug resistance to selected acridone candidates."
10768545,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are two of the most common mental
health disorders and are highly comorbid. Unfortunately, the incidence rate of PTSD is significantly greater in
the Veteran population. Even worse, Veterans with PTSD are almost twice as likely to develop issues with alcohol
abuse and AUD. Both disorders are thought to arise from “aberrant learning” resulting in deficits in the ability to
adjust behavior (e.g. impaired cognitive flexibility) that ultimately drives continued drug abuse or fear behavior.
Recent evidence further suggests that the neurocircuitry of fear and anxiety disorders and the neurocircuitry of
drug addiction have many common characteristics. A prominent feature of both disorders is dysfunctional top-
down control of behavior by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Alterations in prefrontal-mediated cognitive processes
that regulate behavior likely contribute to the high comorbidity of the disorders. Of particular clinical importance,
this comorbidity is associated with significantly worse prognosis of recovery when compared to non-comorbid
individuals. There is also evidence that PTSD symptoms are a significant risk factor for development of AUD
that, in turn, interfere with PTSD treatment and contributes to increased functional impairment. This application
will examine three separate aims that contain novel questions about PTSD/AUD comorbidity and utilize state-of-
the-art techniques to answer them. We propose that the combination of stress and alcohol exposure alters many
factors associated with the disorder including drug use, relapse behavior, cognitive deficits, and vulnerability to
future traumas. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that stress and alcohol exposure alter subsequent
drug, cognitive, and stress-related behaviors through glutamatergic mechanisms in subregions of the PFC. To
test this, we will use a multi-faceted approach that incorporates behavioral pharmacology, optogenetics, and
telemetry to investigate the interactions between a traumatic stressor and chronic alcohol exposure to identify
certain brain mechanisms that may mediate the resulting changes in behavior. Aim 1 will examine the result of
stress and chronic exposure on alcohol-related behaviors including intake, relapse-like behavior, and
consolidation of extinction memories. We will use recent developments in technology to monitor some of the
same measurements in rats that are often used in human studies. Radiotelemetry sensors will be implanted in
the rats to determine whether stress-induced alterations in alcohol behaviors are associated with deficits in heart
rate variability (HRV: a physiological measure that reflects coping ability). In this aim, and the remaining aims,
will attempt to either attenuate or prevent stress- and alcohol-induced behavioral deficits through manipulation
of glutamatergic signaling in the PFC and its projections to other brain regions. Finally, to better understand the
neural mechanisms involved we will measure inflammatory makers in the PFC. Aim 2 will examine a component
of PTSD/AUD that has not been investigated sufficiently in the field. These are cognitive-based tasks that
measure behaviors often seen in the clinical population such as changes in normal decision-making processes.
Thus, we will assess the impact of stress and chronic alcohol on future “risky” behaviors that often precede drug
abuse and the development of PTSD. In Aim 3 we will determine how exposure to the combination of stress and
chronic alcohol leads to significant increases in neuroinflammation in specific brain regions. This is critical
because it provides a potential mechanism for the behavioral effects observed in this population. Importantly,
we have data showing that modulation of mGlu5 can reduce stress/alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and this
provides a novel target for drug treatment. When combined, this set of experiments lays the foundation to
examine PTSD/AUD from multiple perspectives, highlight potential neural mechanisms, and develop novel
treatment options."
10768626,"Project Summary
This proposal addresses the clinically significant issue of bacterial otitis media (OM), a major source of hospital
visits and preventable hearing loss in young children and the most common diagnosis for antibiotic
prescriptions in this age group. Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the two most common causes of bacterial
OM, which results from bacterial invasion from the nasopharynx to the middle ear. Despite widespread vaccine
use, S. pneumoniae remains a significant OM pathogen, indicating the need for new therapeutic approaches.
However, large knowledge gaps remain regarding the host factors which contribute to bacterial OM
pathogenesis. To address these knowledge gaps, we developed a new mouse model of S. pneumoniae
invasion to the middle ear. This model is based on the clinical observation that viral co-infection increases OM
risk in children, and in mice promotes S. pneumoniae invasion. We find that serial administration of the viral
dsRNA analog poly(I:C) is sufficient to promote S. pneumoniae invasion to the middle ear. Poly(I:C) induces
the production of type I interferons (IFNs), which contribute to S. pneumoniae survival in other tissues. In the
first Aim, we address the hypothesis that type I IFNs enhance S. pneumoniae survival in the middle ear. Type I
IFNs can induce production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which we recently demonstrated
suppresses protection against S. pneumoniae infection in the lung. Here, we investigate whether IL-10
signaling in poly(I:C) treated mice enhances S. pneumoniae survival following middle ear invasion, as well as
the impact of IL-10 on middle ear inflammation. Together, these experiments will determine whether type I
IFNs contribute to S. pneumoniae OM pathogenesis. In the second Aim, we investigate the importance of the
host microbiome. Children treated with antibiotics are susceptible to recurrent bacterial OM, and pathogens
including S. pneumoniae are more resistant to antibiotics than many commensal (non-pathogenic) species. In
preliminary data, we find that antibiotic treated mice have increased S. pneumoniae invasion and reduced
neutrophil recruitment to the middle ear. We investigate the importance of microbiome-dependent neutrophil
recruitment for early clearance of S. pneumoniae following middle ear invasion. In the upper airway, the
prevalent commensal Corynebacterium has been identified by next-generation sequencing as negatively
correlated with OM in children, indicating a potentially protective role. Here, we determine whether
Corynebacterium improves protection against S. pneumoniae OM in our mouse model as a first step toward
developing new probiotic-based approaches for OM in children. The long-term goal of these studies is to
develop novel immunotherapy and/or probiotic strategies to improve the burden of OM disease."
10778545,"The organelle membrane system of the eukaryotic cell is constituted by two complementary lipid `territories'.
One originates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where lipid and protein synthesis occurs, and the other is
encompasses the trans-Golgi network (TGN), plasma membrane, and organelles of endo-lysosomal system.
The lipid composition of TGN membrane is modified from that of earlier Golgi compartments by lipid transfer
proteins that deliver lipids directly to TGN membrane at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi membrane
contact site, and from local sphingolipid synthesis, principally sphingomyelin. Hence the composition of the
TGN is refined to approximate that of the plasma membrane (PM); it is enriched in sphingolipid, cholesterol,
and acidic phospholipids, while the ER/Golgi territory is relatively deficient of these lipid classes, even though
most are produced there. Membrane of the TGN/PM territory is asymmetric, with sphingolipids restricted to the
exofacial leaflet and acidic glycerophospholipids (chiefly PS and phosphoinositides) restricted to cytoplasmic
membrane leaflets. There are expansive gaps of knowledge regarding the mechanisms that coordinate the
synthesis and distribution of lipids and proteins between the two lipid territories of the cell. This research will
address these gaps of knowledge, focusing on the trans and TGN Golgi compartments of the Golgi. We will
investigate the roles and regulation of lipid transfer proteins that modify the membrane lipid composition of
these compartments. Preliminary unpublished data identified a cohort of integral membrane signaling proteins
that reside in the TGN and are intimately associated with sphingolipid. We will determine if any of these
proteins function as sensors of Golgi lipid homeostasis, and we will test a hypotheses that they regulate
release of distinct cohorts of secretory cargo into the TGN/PM lipid territory. This research promises to
elucidate new information regarding the regulation of secretion by eukaryotic cells."
10778558,"ABSTRACT
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are in clinical development for delivery of genes to treat multiple genetic
diseases including hemophilia. While progress has been made to optimize gene delivery, in some studies the
required AAV vector doses were high, leading to toxicity and even fatal outcomes in one study. These findings
highlight the need for novel approaches to reduce the AAV vector dose to minimize liver toxicity, anti-AAV
immune responses, and genotoxicity. Our recent studies and work from others have identified an
underappreciated limitation to efficient gene correction with AAV vectors. In a long term study of AAV gene
delivery of FVIII in hemophilia A dogs, we found that most of the AAV vector genomes were highly rearranged
in transduced liver tissues. These rearrangements typically disrupted the transgene, and so would compromise
expression of the transgene product—unexpectedly, our data indicated that most of the AAV vector genomes
present did not produce functional protein after transduction. These rearranged AAV genomes were present in
integrated forms but also in AAV concatemers that may be episomal forms. It is unclear whether these
rearrangements occurred during vector production or after transduction of the target cells, though data is
accumulating that at least some of the rearrangements originate in vector producer cells. Our hemophilia A dog
study also identified integration events in the canine genome within genes linked to cell growth and cancer that
were associated with clonal expansions. Validation of integrated AAV DNA in these expanded clones by
sequence analysis showed that in all cases integrated vectors were highly rearranged, with only one of five
encoding an intact transgene. An extensive literature documents interactions of AAV with host DNA repair
pathways in both vector producer and target cells, though the influence of host factors in AAV DNA
rearrangements is mostly unstudied. We hypothesize that modulation of host cell pathways can suppress AAV
DNA rearrangements, thereby allowing improved transgene expression per vector DNA copy. In this proposal,
we will 1) implement a deep sequencing method to quantify rearrangement frequency in a statistically rigorous
fashion, 2) identify cellular pathways that can be modulated with small molecules, siRNAs, or microRNAs that
suppress vector rearrangements, and 3) devise novel delivery strategies that support efficient pathway
modulation, suppress vector rearrangement, and boost transgene output per vector copy. These methods will
be assessed during AAV vector production (Specific Aim 1) and after AAV delivery in the transduced target cells
(Specific Aim 2). Our deliverables at the end of the project will be a greatly enhanced understanding of the
interaction of AAV with host cell DNA handling pathways, and methods for modulating these pathways to allow
safe and effective gene delivery at lower vector doses."
10778559,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Arteriovenous (AV) malformations (AVMs) are vascular anomalies that shunt blood from an artery directly to a
vein, causing organ dysfunction. AVM pathogenesis is poorly understood, limiting the rational design of
molecular interventions. Our long-term goal is to develop better therapeutic treatments for AVMs, as current
treatment options are limited and risky. Our strategy is to focus on brain AVMs (BAVMs), as they are the most
dangerous AVMs, and findings in BAVM are applicable to AVMs elsewhere in the body. Most BAVMs are
sporadic, but hereditary BAVMs, such as those seen in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), offer an
excellent opportunity to study the molecular mechanism underlying disease processes. HHT is an autosomal
dominant genetic disorder characterized by multifocal AVMs throughout the body, including the brain.
Mutations in activin receptor-like kinase (ALK1) are responsible for Type 2 HHT (HHT2), which represents 25-
57% of all HHT cases. Alk1 is a type I TGFβ receptor for BMP ligands, and the mechanism through which Alk1
leads to AVMs is poorly understood. Building on our strong preliminary data, we propose to establish a novel
HHT2-BAVM mouse model, with which to identify molecular regulators crucial for AVM pathogenesis, using
both a targeted approach and unbiased genome-wide expression profiling. To this end, we propose to
establish a much-needed robust preclinical animal model that faithfully models certain aspects of disease
presentations in HHT2 patients. Existing mouse models of HHT are limited in recapitulating clinical
manifestations. Using a cutting-edge strategy, we have developed a useful mouse model of HHT2-BAVM by
deleting both Alk1 alleles specifically in brain endothelial cells, and have obtained strong preliminary data that
this deletion results in robust BAVM, intracranial hemorrhages, and neurological consequences, without
detectable defects elsewhere in the body. We will first fully characterize this model using innovative, high-
resolution two-photon imaging through a cranial window to access the vasculature in live brains, achieving a
5D perspective (3D vascular structure plus blood velocity over time). W candidate
molecular regulators that promote BAVM formation including AV programming, endothelial barrier,
inflammation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and superoxide production in mice with Alk1 deletion in
the brain endothelium. Finally, we will perform cutting-edge genomic expression profiling to elucidate Alk1
target genes, and then use bioinformatics tools to categorize identified genes based on their functional
characteristics. Our proposed Aims comprise a combination of technical and conceptual innovations that will
advance the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying AVM formation and HHT pathogenesis. Our
work will establish a robust preclinical model for these diseases, uncover new molecular mechanisms
underlying the disease etiology, and impact future clinical practice for patients with HHT and BAVM.

10763014,"Drug overdose deaths in the US have increased exponentially, driven by opioid overdoses. Concurrently,
US surveillance studies have documented increased disability prevalence among adults in midlife. People
with disabilities have higher rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) but are less likely to receive treatment for
it, putting them at higher risk for opioid overdose. Despite these established risks, people with disabilities
remain an understudied subpopulation in the context of the opioid crisis. Much of heightened risk among the
disabled population may be due to chronic pain. Many people with physical disability experience chronic pain
that either drives the disability, termed “high-impact chronic pain”, or that occurs concurrently. Chronic pain is
frequently managed with prescription opioids, sometimes via risky prescribing practices. In addition to chronic
pain, pathways through depression or through loss of economic opportunity and its accompanying stressors
may link physical disability to overdose risk. Opioid prescribing for chronic pain has been linked to increased
risk of opioid overdose, but any such risk conferred by having a physical disability, disentangled from chronic
pain, has not been estimated—nor has the risk associated with co-occurring physical disability and chronic
pain. Moreover, the mechanisms through which disability and chronic pain operate to affect overdose risk are
unknown. Availability of recommended treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs), including OUD, and
chronic pain may influence the relationships, mechanisms, and the associated disparities we propose to study,
but is highly variable across localities. The objectives of this project are: Aim 1) to estimate the unique and
joint contributions of physical disability and chronic pain conditions to opioid overdose risk and the extent to
which pain management practices mediate these relationships; Aim 2) to develop novel statistical methods to
transport mediated effects from one state to another, and to apply those methods in Aim 3) to identify SUD and
pain management treatment metrics that, if improved, may reduce both overall overdose risk associated with
physical disability and chronic pain and disparities in overdose risk by racial/ethnic-gender subgroup. We will
harness geographic variation in the delivery of SUD and pain management treatment and predict the effects
that realistic improvements in delivery would have on reducing opioid overdose in this vulnerable population.
The proposed research is expected to estimate the extent to which physical disability increases risk of opioid
overdose, the proportion of that increased risk attributable to chronic pain and attendant risky pain manage-
ment practices (versus non-chronic pain mechanisms), and the extent to which risk may be mitigated by
improvements in delivering appropriate chronic pain management and SUD (including OUD) treatment. This
will allow for future prevention strategies to be tailored to the particular needs and challenges faced by people
with physical disabilities, with the goal of ultimately making a significant contribution to improving prescribing
practices and provision of recommended treatments to reduce their risk of opioid overdose."

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng), the gram-negative bacterium responsible for the sexually transmitted infection
gonorrhea, is categorized as a high-priority pathogen for research and development efforts. In the US, over 50%
of Ng isolates are resistant to at least one antimicrobial and the CDC has ranked Ng as one of the top 5 urgent
antibiotic resistant threats. Gonorrhea outcomes are especially devastating in sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic
minorities and resource-limited countries. Ng’s “superbug” status, its high morbidity, and the serious health and
psychological impacts of gonorrhea necessitate vaccine development. To address the urgent need for an
effective and safe vaccine against gonorrhea, we propose to use a powerful Virus-like-Particle (VLP) vaccine
platform with a highly effective split-protein conjugation system to deliver promising Ng antigens (Ag) as full-
length and natively folded proteins. We selected for this proposal six promising lipoproteins based on their: 1)
exceptional conservation in >5K sequenced Ng isolates worldwide; 2) surface-exposure; 3) ability to elicit
bactericidal antibodies (Abs); 4) expression in geographically and temporally diverse Ng strains, during different
in vitro conditions and Ng infection in the gonorrhea mouse model; and 5) important functions in Ng pathogenesis
and physiology. We will: 1) Design and produce antigen-VLP formulations; 2) Identify Ag-VLP and adjuvant
combinations that generate robust immune responses; and 3) Evaluate efficacy of promising vaccines and
elucidate the immune correlates of protection. Our approach presents conceptual and technical innovations in
the gonorrhea vaccine field by pioneering VLP-display of conserved, full-length Ng lipoproteins, which will be
comparatively assessed for efficacy and potential mechanisms of protection."

In this SBIR grant proposal, “Development of a prototype clinical theranostic platform combining Magnetic
Particle Imaging (MPI) and Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) for the treatment of brain tumors” we will develop
a human brain-sized, integrated localized MFH/MPI system. We will develop an imaging-guided MFH treatment
device capable of closed-loop localized heating and tomographic temperature monitoring during treatment.
 MFH relies on the delivery of magnetic nanoparticles to tumors followed by application of alternating magnetic
fields, which causing local heating of tissue and killing of tumor cells. Cell death occurs due to the heat or by
enhancing the cytotoxic effects of radio/chemotherapy. MFH offers considerable potential for numerous
biomedical applications, especially as an adjunct to radiation therapy in the clinical treatment of recurrent
glioblastoma. However, MFH currently suffers from limitations that persist after nearly four decades of clinical
experience and regulatory approval in Europe. Following delivery, the nanoparticle distribution within the tumor
can be heterogeneous and unpredictable, leading to undertreatment in areas of low MNP concentration, and
excessive heating near normal tissues. These issues are compounded by a limited ability to accurately monitor
tissue temperature in 3D and in realtime.
 The technology developed in this SBIR constitutes a paradigm shift for MFH by developing the first human-
sized localized MFH system. Localized MFH is a new technology that uses strong magnetic field gradients to
confine MNP heating to a small region. Particles within the region can generate heat, while those outside the
region cannot. Our technology will transition clinical MFH from the current state of the art of loosely targeted,
regional heating to mm-accurate localized heating of target tissues. We believe this transition from regional to
precisely targeted is comparable to the transition of early, loosely targeted radiation therapy to the present day,
3D-targeted intensity-modulated radiation therapy.
 In this Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal, we will add MFH to our existing clinical-scale MPI prototype to enable
localized MPI/MFH with integrated temperature sensing, and validate the performance in animal cadavers
through the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. Build a clinical RF heating head coil for simultaneous MFH and imaging and integrate it into our
prototype clinical imager
 Aim 2. Integrate MPI-based temperature sensing with heating to control MFH to a treatment plan.
 Aim 3. Test overall system in phantoms and animal cadavers in preparation for preclinical trials in dogs
 At the end of this Direct to Phase II proposal, we will have demonstrated integrated MPI/MFH for precisely
localized image-guided therapeutic heating in a prototype that is suitable for clinical studies. In our future work,
we plan to test this system in a large animal trial at JHU for treatment of spontaneous canine GBM."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) impacts upwards of 15 million Americans in the United States and has many
consequences on overall health and quality of life for people affected by this disorder. Despite this, only around
seven percent of people with AUD seek treatment and options for care remain limited, creating an urgent need
for more research into the development and treatment of AUD. A major source of interest lies in what factors
predispose certain individuals who consume alcohol over others to develop AUD, which can provide insight
into specific preventative and treatment measures for this population. Deficits in cognitive domains of response
inhibition and cognitive flexibility have been implicated as risk factors for later development of AUD and are
predictors of more severe alcohol induced cognitive dysfunction. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is at the
center of the brain circuitry that mediates aspects of cognitive function known to be impaired in AUD and
studying the underlying neural pathways impacted by alcohol exposure has been a major area of study in the
field. Human neuroimaging studies have identified mPFC projecting neurons to ventral tegmental area (VTA)
as an important circuit in reward processing and initiation of goal directed behavior as well as alcohol craving in
AUD models. The aim of this proposal is to utilize cutting edge techniques in single cell in vivo calcium imaging
and behavioral tasks in mice to understand the contribution of this important but understudied pathway to
preexisting and alcohol-induced deficits in cognitive function. Using complex operant positive reinforcement
behavioral paradigms to test domains of cognitive flexibility and response inhibition in mice combined with
single cell in vivo calcium imaging dynamics of mPFC→VTA projections as mice complete the task, I will study
how this pathway responds to and changes as mice learn before and after alcohol exposure. I will first study
whether there are individual differences in cognitive function in response inhibition and cognitive flexibility in
mice at baseline with an operant behavioral task, after which I will characterize the activity pattern of
mPFC→VTA projecting neurons using head mounted microendoscopes to capture real time neuronal activity
of these projections in the mPFC in freely behaving mice as they learn the tasks. Further, using longitudinal
tracking analysis, I will determine if there are individual differences in activity patterns between mice with
variations in baseline cognitive function and how these changes evolve after binge drinking alcohol exposure in
a two-bottle choice task. Completion of this proposal will provide valuable insight into the circuit level changes
that underlie individual differences in vulnerability to alcohol induced cognitive deficits and will provide
invaluable training for me as a future independent academic researcher."

Interdisciplinary Systems-based Training for Precision Nutrition
The future workforce and current thought leaders in precision nutrition need in-depth knowledge of artificial
intelligence (AI) to harness the power of modern technologies such as multi-omics and wearables to combat
diet-related chronic diseases related to the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK). Arizona State University (ASU), through the College of Health Solutions (CHS), is poised to
meet this need through its multidisciplinary, transformative new structure. CHS has organized its research
enterprise and academic programs into “Translational Teams,” wherein faculty, trainees, and community
stakeholders work together to more rapidly translate basic discovery into practice. We propose a predoctoral
and postdoctoral training program - rooted in foundational disciplines of nutrition and big data analytics - that will
focus on courses and practical experiences related to precision nutrition. Students will be drawn from long-
standing and successful PhD programs in Exercise & Nutritional Sciences and Biomedical Informatics, both of
which are already housed within CHS and have strong collaborative ties among faculty and programmatic
requirements. Our training program will provide an interdisciplinary, comprehensive training in precision nutrition
topics, reflecting the expertise of our mentor team in nutrition and metabolism (obesity and diabetes; microbiome
and functional foods; energy balance; wearable technologies; and digital health interventions) and artificial
intelligence and systems modeling (multimodal and multiscale data integration; systems biology; actionable and
interpretable AI; AI-based personalization ; time-series and mobile device analytics; and geographic information
systems). The training program will support nine new predoctoral students and two postdoctoral students, each
of whom will be mentored by a multidisciplinary pair of accomplished nutrition and big data analytics scientists.
All trainees will be provided a hybrid-delivered “bootcamp” experience in nutrition and data science upon entry
into the program to build a strong foundation for interdisciplinary training. Trainees will then sample from relevant
courses in statistical and machine learning, energetics, nutrigenomics, clinical applications, adaptive trial design,
etc... The training will be further supported by regular seminar series and journal clubs; experiential rotations;
annual symposia; and community, industry, and healthcare-based internships. As an institution that serves >25%
Hispanic population, our training program will emphasize recruitment of this and other underrepresented student
populations and engage with disadvantaged communities. We will leverage our rich training environment of
ongoing federally-funded projects, along with our collaborative partners at the Phoenix VA Healthcare System,
and the NIDDK Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, to provide trainee access to diverse
datasets specific to underrepresented populations of the Southwest. This interdisciplinary training program will
produce the next-generation precision nutrition scientists capable of solving the complex biomedical challenges

10912787,"Major barriers to chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) research are the inability to predict the likelihood
of response to cGVHD therapy and subsequent patient survival. This absence of predictive biomarkers is partly
due to the complex pathology of cGVHD, which involves both soluble and cellular factors but mostly due to the
paucity, so far, of samples collected when specific cGVHD treatments are initiated, particularly as novel and
more targeted treatments for cGVHD are now available. Thus, major questions remaining in the field are: Can
we target more than one cGVHD pathway with a single drug? Can we detect biomarkers to predict future
resistance to treatment using already validated cGVHD biomarkers? Can we discover more specific markers
through a high throughput proteomics pipeline? Can we validate and utilize these predictive biomarkers to
provide strong support for FDA approval of these biomarkers? For this project, we will use samples (plasma
and PBMCs) collected during Dr. Pavletic trial testing Pacritanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with specificity for
JAK2 and IRAK1, in patients with steroid-refractory/steroid-dependent (SR/D) cGVHD to analyze proteomic
signatures associated with prediction of cGVHD therapy nonresponse, and with prognosis of nonrelapse
mortality (NRM). Proposed markers are based on previous studies and will include other novel or hypothesized
factors. We will test the hypothesis that plasma proteomic panels measured prior to the start of cGVHD
treatment with pacritinib (PAC) will stratify HCT patients for prediction of resistance, and NRM at 1 year. We
will determine the thresholds of different biomarkers and panels that provide best sensitivity and specificity.
Our overarching hypothesis addresses gaps remaining by addressing two specific aims (SA): SA1: Are five
previously identified plasma cGVHD biomarkers [chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, matrix
metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3), and Stimulation 2 (ST2; the interleukin (IL)-33
receptor)] predictive of resistance to PAC therapy? We will measure them using ELISA from fresh blood
samples collected during this award: ~35 samples pre-treatment and 3- and 6-months post-treatment. SA2:
Can additional plasma biomarkers that are key biologic drivers of cGVHD resistance be discovered through our
proteomics pipeline comparing responders vs. non responders? We will address this question using our well-
established proteomic workflow that can identify and quantify more than 2000 proteins. Upon completion, these
studies will result in biomarker panels that may facilitate prediction of response and resistance to therapy and
identify candidates for new therapeutic approaches."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hemoglobinopathies in the world. It results from a mutation in the
hemoglobin β gene which causes hemoglobin polymerization, leading to chronic hemolysis, inflammation, damage to
organs, and increased early morbidity. SCD pathophysiology can damage and stress the bone marrow microenvironment
and resident hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as evidenced in our pilot studies revealing fewer functional HSCs in the bone
marrow of both mice and individuals with SCD. Sinusoidal and arterial vascular networks in the SCD bone marrow are also
significantly disrupted. Furthermore, SCD is marked by decreased numbers of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a
heterogeneous cell population that functions as critical regulators of HSC self-renewal and differentiation. We observed
significant changes to MSC transcriptional profiles in SCD and identified three aberrant SCD MSC phenotypes: 1) increased
SCD MSC cell cycling, 2) increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and 3) decreased HSC support. The transcription
factor Early B Cell Factor 3 (EBF3) is a standout differentially expressed gene in SCD MSCs and a known regulator of cell
cycle. Loss of EBF3 in MSC subpopulations dramatically impacts bone marrow composition and HSC support. Cumulatively,
these findings lead me to hypothesize that EBF3 downregulation in bone marrow MSCs during SCD causes
transcriptional changes that decrease their HSC support capacity. In Aim 1, I will determine how Ebf3 downregulation is
driving the changes we observe in mouse SCD MSCs via over-expression and knockdown of Ebf3 in SCD and control MSCs;
I will then quantify changes to their HSC support capacity through ex vivo primary cultures and in vivo transplantation
studies. In Aim 2, I will identify EBF3 transcriptional targets and their cellular functions in control and SCD MSCs via protein-
chromatin interaction studies, gene ontology analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis as well as mechanistic
interrogation of Ebf3 downregulation. In Aim 3, I will investigate the translational impact of EBF3 downregulation in human
SCD MSCs by again employing over-expression and knockdown systems to perturb EBF3 expression and quantify how this
impacts their support of human HSCs. I will also elucidate the transcriptional targets of EBF3 in human MSCs, which has
never been done before. This study will be an important first step in better understanding how transcriptional dysfunction
in SCD MSCs influences HSC support, which, in turn, may be critical in the improvement of SCD curative therapies."

Natural products serve crucial roles in the pharmaceutical industry as drugs or leads for drug compounds.
Generated through secondary metabolism, these molecules impact the virulence, symbiosis, and survival of
microorganisms. The nonproteinogenic oxyvinylglycine amino acids are an interesting class of secondary
metabolites characterized by the presence of a vinyl oxygen moiety. Members of this class, such as 4-(2’-
aminoethoxy)vinylglycine (AVG), are known to arrest germination in plants by inhibiting the pyridoxal 5’-
phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase.2 While the
biosynthesis of vinyl ether-bearing oxyvinylglycine nonproteinogenic amino acids including AVG has been
explored, the formation of other members of the family with alternative functional groups remains
undetermined. 4-Formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG), an oxyvinylglycine containing an N–O bond, was reported
to have duel herbicidal and bactericidal activity.3,4 The gvg biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas
fluorescens strain WH6 is responsible for the biosynthesis of FVG and the related compounds
guanidinooxyvinylglycine (GOVG) and aminooxyvinylglycine (AOVG) though the exact biosynthetic mechanism
remains unclear.5,6 In this proposal I will determine the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the formation of
FVG, GOVG, and AOVG. I will use a combination of feeding experiments and in vitro biochemical assays to
determine the substrate and product of each enzyme along the biosynthetic pathway of these three
nonproteinogenic amino acids. The vinyl alkoxyamine is unusual in amino acids, therefore I will characterize
the enzyme responsible for N–O bond construction and determine its chemical mechanism. These studies will
facilitate the bioinformatic discovery of similar oxyvinylglycine nonproteinogenic amino acids. Moreover,
characterization of the iron-dependent enzyme responsible for N–O bond formation will facilitate its use in a
synthetic context to expand the repertoire of oxidative biocatalysts."

T-cell priming is orchestrated in the sequestered environment of lymph nodes (LNs) where a cascade of co-
inhibitory and co-stimulatory signals from an assembly of cell types determines systemic, immunodominant
responses to regionally presented antigens (Ag). Yet tumor draining LNs (tdLNs) are often tolerized against
tumor Ags (tAgs), rendering an otherwise inhospitable environment permissive to regional LN metastases and
eventual dissemination throughout the body. While checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) cancer therapy
is meant to re-invigorate T-cell priming and effector function against tAgs, these therapies are administered i.v.
without regard to all the other non-tAgs that are present in the body. As a result of this Ag-indiscriminate
activity, CBI can cause immune related adverse events (irAEs) that limit the use of current and emerging CBI.
In addition, because tdLNs are already tolerized to tAgs by the time of cancer detection, the effectiveness of
CBI to potently prime tAg-specific T-cell responses may be limited. While CBI does result in durable cancer
cures, most cancer types are non-responsive and the majority of patients with cancers known to be responsive
either do not benefit from CBI treatment or experience relapse and irAEs.
In this application, multi-disciplinary teams from the University of Texas and University of Bern collaborate to
deliver both tAg and CBI to non-tdLNs in order to mount efficient, tAg-directed CBI without the irAEs that
impact other CBI combinational therapies. Specifically, the team proposes to develop and use a translatable,
plant-based, virus-like-particle (VLP) platform presenting private tumor neoantigens (tNeoAgs) and to combine
it with CBI delivered to lymphatic watersheds in syngeneic mouse models of triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Effectiveness of the approach is evidenced by strong preliminary data showing enhanced anti-tumor
responses accompanied by clonal expansion of cytolytic, tAg-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from
bioinformatic analyses of single cell RNA sequencing. The team further proposes to separately dose different
VLP-tNeoAgs with CBI to discrete lymphatic watersheds to mount multiple, immunodominant responses to
combat tumor immune escape and regrowth. The team will also test safety of the approach in a transgenic
mouse susceptible to induced lymphatic infiltration in normal tissues as a clinical readout of irAEs following CBI
dosing. Because the teams have translated their respective technologies into clinical studies, the
developments made herein could be rapidly implemented to improve the efficacy of current and emerging CBI,
establish the concept of personalized cancer vaccines, and expand the use of CBI in TNBC patients who have
limited treatment options."
10745681,"ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to define a new mechanism of antiviral activity by an Interferon stimulated gene (ISG)
Oligoadenylate Synthetase 1 (OAS1). The host innate immune response is initiated by the sensing of non-self
viral nucleic acid, and largely mediated through type I and III interferons (IFN). IFNs induce expression of
hundreds of ISGs, many of which inhibit virus replication in infected cells, protect uninfected neighboring cells,
and shape the adaptive immune response to clear virus infection. OASs are a family of ISG that belongs to an
evolutionarily ancient family of nucleotidyl-transferases (NTase). The canonical antiviral mechanism of OAS
proteins involves the enzymatic synthesis of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates, causing downstream activation of RNase L
and leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. However, the mechanisms of antiviral activity of multiple
enzymatically active and inactive OAS isoforms present in human and mouse genomes are not yet clear.
We have found that a specific OAS1 isoform enhances the translation of multiple antiviral proteins, including
cGAS and IRF1. This OAS1 isoform (OAS1 P46) enhances translation independent of its enzymatic activity and
RNase L. Our preliminary results suggest that OAS1 P46 enhances the translation of specific proteins through
binding respective mRNAs. In humans, OAS1 P46 is generated due to an alternative splicing event at the C-
terminal of the OAS1 gene. A naturally occurring polymorphism (rs10774671, A/G) at this alternative splice site
regulates P46 expression, and has been associated with disease severity to multiple virus infections. Using
primary human hematopoietic cells, we demonstrate that rs10774671 G allele coding for P46 also enhances
IRF1 protein expression in T cells. We also provide multiple evidences suggesting the functional equivalence
between OAS1 P46 and a mouse ortholog, Oas1b (no NTase activity), which similarly affects WNV susceptibility
in vivo. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that specific isoforms of OAS1 modulate innate immune
responses against viruses through unique NTase activity-independent mechanisms.
The goal of this proposal is to determine how OAS1 enhances specific protein translation, and the consequences
of this newly identified function of OAS1 on the antiviral innate and adaptive immunity. Our three independent
Aims are to: (1) Determine the molecular mechanism of OAS1-mediated translational regulation through
biochemical and cell biology approaches; (2) Define the cellular targets mediating the antiviral effect of OAS1
using several gene-deficient cells; and (3) Define the in vivo role of Oas1b during virus infection using a newly
generated Oas1b knock-in mouse. Upon completion of this study, we should establish a new paradigm of antiviral
activity by OAS proteins that may lead to therapeutic strategies modulating this OAS1-cGAS-type I IFN axis."

Over the past 37 years, Brown University's AHRQ-supported Institutional T32 Training Program has developed
over 70 interdisciplinary and highly productive pre and post-doctoral health services researchers. Nearly all
former trainees are employed in faculty, government or private sector research positions. Our last two awards
provided support for pre-doctoral trainees in health services research, and we capitalized on that opportunity to
successfully recruit talented students who have now become promising health services researchers. We
attribute our success in both pre- and post-doctoral training to: 1) attracting and recruiting high quality, diverse
applicants; 2) an individualized training experience to meet trainee goals; 3) a mentoring strategy consistent
with multidisciplinary work; 4) an organizational culture of synergy between training and research missions; 5)
an extensive research portfolio ($42 million in 2022); and 6) over 30 multidisciplinary faculty committed to pre
and post-doctoral training. Major changes in health care policy and delivery system reform make it essential to
have well trained researchers operating in academic, government and private sector settings who understand
the factors shaping these trends and who have the skill to evaluate their impact and design alternative
approaches. To address this need, our training program aims to produce health services researchers who
have the leadership skills and methodologic expertise to inform policy, improve health system performance,
and, promote better population health outcomes. Specific objectives of this training program are: 1) To recruit
highly qualified and socio-demographically diverse post- and pre-doctoral trainees; 2) To develop scientists
experienced in the use of state-of-the-art health services research methods, with specific foci in evidence-
based medicine, comparative effectiveness research, chronic disease and aging, etc.; 3) To develop scientists
skilled in the communication of scientific knowledge who are able to work in multidisciplinary teams in
academia, government and the private sector; 4) To provide didactic as well as ""hands on"" supervised

10866466,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application seeks renewal of support for the University of Pennsylvania’s (Penn’s)
postdoctoral training program in health services research (HSR). The program’s overall goal is
to train investigators to conduct independent, rigorous, and high-impact HSR and thereby
improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and equity of health care organization, financing, and
delivery. Our program leverages Penn’s well-established institutions and resources dedicated to
producing high-quality and high-impact HSR, including top-tier educational programs,
outstanding faculty and mentorship, a robust research infrastructure, and a strong institutional
commitment to HSR. Addressing the complex challenges facing the nation’s healthcare system
requires diverse perspectives and partnerships across multiple academic disciplines. In
recognition of this, we have designed our post-doctoral training program for both clinicians
seeking to become clinician-researchers by acquiring HSR skills, as well as PhD-trained
economists seeking to apply their methodological expertise to the field of HSR. Our program not
only develops these competencies for both trainee groups, but also, by linking clinician-
researchers with PhD-trained postdocs in Penn’s collaborative and interdisciplinary HSR
training environment, we aim to develop leaders who can build diverse and inclusive
investigator teams that combine disciplinary and institutional expertise. Our T32 program will
continue to be administered by Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine, which houses one of our
training program’s key educational curricula—the Master of Science in Health Policy
Research—and will closely collaborate with Penn’s Leonard Davis Institute for Health
Economics (LDI), which runs the second key training program component—LDI’s postdoctoral
program for health economists. The Perelman School and LDI have a long and robust history of
successful collaborations. This program will also continue to draw on additional faculty expertise
and mentoring from Penn’s Wharton School, Penn’s School of Nursing, and the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia. Together these entities are well suited to provide the highest quality
training environment to both clinician-researchers and PhD-trained economists seeking to
become independent and influential health services researchers. Thus, our HSR training
program capitalizes on Penn’s unique strengths and long history in fostering cutting-edge
research across its schools and disciplines. Our program’s graduates will have the necessary
skills to address the health care delivery system’s most pressing problems and make health
care organization and delivery higher quality, safer, more efficient, and equitable."

Efficiently connecting underserved smokers with limited resources to efficacious tobacco cessation treatments
that are easily accessible is crucial for disease prevention and the elimination of health disparities. This study
seeks to address this need through partnering with a large social service network to evaluate the efficacy and
economic impact of a theoretically-based, fully automated, interactive smartphone-based smoking cessation
intervention. The Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma (RFBO) is the largest hunger-relief charity in the state, and
through a network of 14 Food and Resource Centers (FRC), provides food to more than 136,000 food insecure
clients each week across 53 counties. Our preliminary data indicate that the prevalence of current smoking
among adult clients is 46% (more than 3 times the prevalence in the general US population). Participants
(n=500) will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: 1) Standard Treatment (ST; n=250) or
Automated Treatment (AT; n=250). ST participants will be electronically connected to the Oklahoma Tobacco
Helpline using a tablet-based web portal that is specific to this study. This approach is designed to mirror the
Ask Advise Connect (AAC) approach to linking smokers in healthcare systems with quitline treatment that our
team has previously developed and evaluated. ST will be evaluated against AT, a fully automated treatment
enrollment and delivery approach. In the AT condition, participants will receive an interactive smartphone-
based intervention that comprises content delivered via audio/video clips and interactive text content. Much of
the programming and developmental work for AT has already been completed by the Stephenson Cancer
Center's mHealth Shared Resource, and results from a series of pilot studies (including work conducted in
partnership with the RFBO sites) with beta versions of the mobile application are extremely encouraging.
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of transdermal patches will be provided to all participants (ST
and AT). Our overall goal of this project is to determine if AT performs better than the more resource intensive
ST approach. If efficacy is established, the AT approach will be readily scalable, easily implemented by
community-based organizations, and offer an efficient way to allocate limited public health resources to
tobacco control interventions. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of AT and ST in facilitating abstinence
from smoking. It is hypothesized that at the 12-month follow-up assessment, 7-day point prevalence smoking
abstinence rates will be higher in AT compared to ST. Secondary aims are to: 1) Compare the magnitude of
the mediated effects via common mechanisms (i.e., motivation, agency, and stress/negative affect) on smoking
abstinence between the AT and ST treatment groups; and 2) Conduct economic evaluations to assess the cost
and/or cost-effectiveness of AT vs. ST. There is a critical need for theoretically-based, cost-effective, and
sustainable cessation treatments that have broad dissemination potential, and the AT intervention has been
designed to help fill this need."
10746525,"Proposed studies are to test mechanism-based, clinically relevant interventions to meet the challenges of
aging in the Veteran population. Hearing Loss is one of the most common service-related disabilities for those
who served in the gulf wars and age-related hearing loss (ARHL) contributes to this. Our current studies in the
mouse model found that rapamycin significantly delayed / reduced ARHL. Our preliminary now show potential
for 17-α-estradiol as another treatment option that acts on a different functional signaling pathway. Aim 1A will
test 17-α-estradiol treatment for ARHL and Aim 1B will examine if a combination of rapamycin and 17-α-
estradiol treatments increases overall efficacy over either alone.
Noise and Aging are the two most common causes of hearing loss and for many Veterans ARHL will
superimpose on an auditory system already compromised by noise exposure during their service. Our current
studies found that noise exposure during youth significantly accelerated and increased ARHL and our pilot
studies suggest rapamycin treatment starting shortly after the noise exposure can significantly reduce this
noise enhancement of ARHL. Aim 1C will test efficacy of rapamycin treatment starting later in life (more
pertinent to treatment of Veterans) shortly before noise acceleration would appear.
Balance and gait disorders effect millions of Americans and become worse with aging. We hypothesize that
inner age aging disorders share sufficient underlying mechanisms such that the treatments we have shown
to delay / reduce ARHL will also delay / reduce age-related vestibular dysfunction (ARVD). This is tested in
Aim 2A. Aim 2B will test if noise overstimulation given in youth will have a comparable influence on ARVD
as we see with ARHL, and result in an acceleration and enhancement of age-related vestibular
dysfunction. This would lead to later studies testing treatments."
10782011,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, and currently there exists no
disease modifying therapy. Familial forms of AD (FAD) are caused by mutations in Amyloid Precursor Protein
(APP), whose processing can result in the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ), or by mutations in Presenilin 1/2
(PSEN1/2), which comprise in part the γ-secretase complex that cleaves Aβ from fragments of APP. My long-
term career goal is to study the mechanism of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease. The more proximate
goal, as put forward in this proposal, is to characterize the neurodegeneration in a new rat knock-in model of
Presenilin1 dysfunction. Psen1-knockout (Psen1-KO) mice and knock-in (KI) mice with homozygous FAD-
associated L435F mutations (Psen1LF/LF) are embryonic and perinatally lethal, precluding a more rigorous
examination of the effect of AD-causing Psen1 mutations on neurodegeneration. Given the better suitability of
rats as a model organism, with regards to surgical interventions and behavior testing, we generated a rat KI
model of the Psen1LF mutation. We find that, unexpectedly and in contrast to Psen1LF/LF, Psen1LF/LF rats survive
into adulthood despite a loss of γ-secretase activity. The survival of these rats affords the opportunity to
examine the effect of homozygous Psen1 AD mutations on neurodegeneration."

 and risk management
Abstract
Worldwide, the estimated annual incidence of ovarian cancer is 204,000, with 125,000 deaths. Despite
advances in therapy, ovarian cancer remains the most deadly of the gynecological cancers. Less than
30% of women with advanced stage disease survive long-term. One of the reasons for the high fatality
rate is that more than 70% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced disease.
Photoacoustic tomography is an emerging technology that maps tumor vasculature content and oxygen
saturation, which are functional biomarkers of malignant development. Using co-registered
photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and ultrasound (US), we have developed a new noninvasive
transvaginal imaging device for non-invasive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Initial data have shown that
co-registered PAT/US identifies invasive epithelial ovarian cancers by demonstrating extensively
distributed and higher levels of relative total hemoglobin (rHbT) in the US-identified region of interest
(ROI), as compared with more scattered and lower levels of relative total hemoglobin in benign and
normal ovaries (p=0.01). PAT/US identifies invasive epithelial ovarian cancers, as well as non-invasive
borderline and stromal tumors, by differentiating the lower SO2 in the US-identified ROI from the higher
values in benign and normal ovaries (p=0.003).
In this proposed work, we will 1) optimize our co-registered photoacoustic and ultrasound system and
user interface, 2) develop and validate classification models using photoacoustic functional imaging
biomarkers, PAT/US spectral features, and the known biomarker CA125, and 3) develop light fluence
correction algorithms for quantitative photoacoustic imaging to characterize ovarian tissue vasculature.
We will prospectively assess the ability of co-registered PAT/US to assist conventional imaging for
more accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancers and reduction of benign surgeries, without compromising
cancer detection. We will also monitor a group of high-risk women to determine if co-registered
PAT/US can be used as a potential sensitive and specific screening tool to differentiate normal from
early angiogenesis changes of the malignant process. The successful completion of the project will
provide a means to improve the current clinical practice."
10916434,"The objective of this SBIR Direct Phase II proposal is to carry QATCH’s nanovisQ™ technology, which is a
wide-shear-rate range and low volume viscometer for determining developability and injectability of
biopharmaceutical formulations, from single-test sensors to high-throughput and automated format. This
objective is motivated by the needs of the growing protein-based biopharmaceutical therapeutics industry (with
global market size over $300 billion). Protein-based therapeutics are administered as high concentration
formulations due to the volume constraints of subcutaneous injections. However, increased protein-protein
interactions at these high concentrations can cause high viscosity and prevent injectability and manufacturability.
Existing viscometers consume high volumes of sample, which prevents early-stage assessment and still have
high protein and time costs at later stages. By developing a high-throughput, automated, wide shear rate range,
low volume viscometer, protein molecules and formulations can be optimized for injectability/manufacturability
earlier with less cost and risk. This proposal is significant because the proposed device can start assessing
injectability of protein formulations earlier in drug development, perform this test in a higher number of
formulations faster and with less material than existing technologies and consequently reduce the time and cost
of R&D spent in developing new, injectable protein-based therapeutics considerably. As preliminary studies,
QATCH demonstrated wide-shear-rate and low sample volume viscometers for protein formulations in single-
test format. In addition, QATCH showed that 4 simultaneous measurements from 4 sensors with 9 mm spacing
on the same quartz blank can be achieved accurately. As a result, the nanovisQ™ is now positioned to be a 6x4
sensor matrix and automated viscometer for high concentration protein formulations. In SBIR Phase II QATCH
is proposing to 1) develop 4-sensor arrays with extended shear-rate viscosity measurements to serve high-
concentration protein formulations 2) develop 6x4 sensor matrix for the high-throughput system with
environmental control and the automated sample delivery capability. Developing a high-throughput and
automated low-sample volume viscometer is a key step towards commercialization since low-sample volume
and high-throughput are two most important parameters for drug development groups."
10757733,"The role of GSK3/PPAR-δ/FAO/mitophagy pathway in regulating
 hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and function
Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess the abilities to both produce stem cells, a
property known as self-renewal, and give rise to all differentiated hematopoietic lineages.
Clinically, HSCs are therapeutically valuable for transplantation in treatment of various
hematologic malignances. Despite remarkable progress made in the research of HSCs
during the past three decades, the molecular mechanisms regulating HSC homeostasis
and function are still not fully understood.
Our previous published showed that GSK3 plays an essential role in regulating HSC
homeostasis. Specifically, knockdown of Gsk3 promote transient expansion and long-term
exhaustion of HSC in vivo. Our new preliminary studies demonstrated that GSK3 functions
through PPAR-δ/FAO/mitophagy pathway to regulate HSC division symmetry; inhibition
of GSK3 induces mitophagy and conversely, blocking PPAR-δ/FAO/mitophagy can
reverse the enhanced self-renewal phenotype that is associated with GSK3 inhibition. In
this study, we will first examine how GSK3 regulates PPAR-δ, which in turn regulates
mitophagy and HSC division symmetry. Secondly, we will investigate whether loss-of-
function of Ppar-δ, Park2 or Pink1 (two mitophagy key regulators) reverse the functional
defect of Gsk3b-deficient HSC in vivo. Lastly, we will explore whether GSK3 controls FAO
and lipid metabolism to regulate HSC function and homeostasis.
Our study will provide significant new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
GSK3-dependent regulation of HSC homeostasis and function. The knowledge learned
may facilitate bone marrow transplantation for treating diverse hematological diseases."
10757734,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The increasing prevalence of dementia worldwide is considered a looming public health
crisis, and few effective treatments are available to alleviate patients’ cognitive decline and associated psychiatric
symptoms. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical dementia syndrome defined as an initial, focal decline
in language abilities and atrophy of the language-dominant hemisphere. While not a core diagnostic criterion,
most persons with PPA also develop severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and disinhibition, which
are distressing and burdensome to both patients and their caregivers. Determining the biological substrates of
these symptoms is challenging because one dementia syndrome can result from several underlying pathologies.
In PPA, for example, underlying neuropathologies include Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar
degeneration with tauopathy (FTLD-tau) or TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP). The exact biological
substrates causing neuropsychiatric symptoms to emerge and worsen over time in dementia syndromes are
unclear. Understanding how regional distributions of various pathologies lead to neuropsychiatric presentations
may serve as a valuable antemortem biomarker and deepen our knowledge of brain-behavior relationships. A
central hypothesis is that each pathology will be associated with distinct neuropsychiatric signatures that change
predictably with disease progression. To investigate this, the proposed research will identify the neuropsychiatric
symptoms unique to AD, FTLD-tau, and FTLD-TDP within one dementia syndrome (PPA). The focus of Aim 1 of
this study is to characterize distinct neuropsychiatric phenotypes of multiple underlying pathologies as they lead
to PPA. It is hypothesized that symptoms will initially diverge between neuropathologies and will converge in the
final stages of disease. Unique and shared neuropsychiatric symptoms will be assessed longitudinally between
AD, FTLD-tau, and FTLD-TDP in PPA relative to each other and to a cognitively healthy group. The goal of Aim
2 is to determine relationships between neuropsychiatric signatures and pathologic markers in frontal and limbic
brain regions. It is expected that hemispheric and regional densities of different these markers will show strong
associations with salient neuropsychiatric symptoms. Bilateral frontal and limbic regions will be analyzed for
pathologic inclusions, neuronal and synaptic integrity, and neuroinflammatory (microglia) markers, which will be
quantified in whole hemisphere sections using unbiased stereology and digital pathology methods. This project
will occur within the Northwestern Alzheimer’s Disease Center, which is a multidisciplinary, international PPA
referral center that will provide access to over 50 postmortem brains from persons with PPA and thus represents
an
ideal environment for the proposed research and training. The public health impact of this study is substantial
as AD, FTLD-tau, and FTLD-TDP underlie the majority of neurodegenerative dementias, and results have the
potential to inform diagnostic and treatment approaches for patients with dementia."
11005455,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The goal of this combined Phase I/II SBIR project is to accomplish key milestones in commercializing a
protein therapeutic for Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) that will enhance the repair capacity of muscle cell
sarcolemmal membranes compromised by mutations in the dystrophin gene that reduce the expression level
or function of the dystrophin protein. Many mutations in the dystrophin gene result can in BMD while others
result in the more severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Myos Inc. is developing a novel recombinant
construct of the tripartite protein 72/mitsugumin 53 (TRIM72/MG53), an essential regulator of membrane repair
in skeletal and cardiac muscle. It is known that rhMG53 therapy ameliorates disease pathology in a dystrophin
deficient mouse model and models of other muscular dystrophies, strongly suggesting that it may enhance
repair and restoration of muscle function in BMD. However, recent potential toxicity concerns make the original
rhMG53 protein sequence suboptimal for protein therapy. Therefore, we engineered a new version of the
rhMG53 protein for use in treating BMD by optimizing its functional and biochemical properties. This Phase I/II
project will further develop this novel protein by producing the data necessary to support an investigational new
drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through three specific aims. Aim 1 will
develop Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) protocols for production of this protein. Optimization of
protein production from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell cultures will be conducted at a CMO focused on
protein production in CHO cells. We will also conduct stability testing up to 24 months for the protein as part of
the studies in this aim. The deliverables will be a scale-up protocol for production of this protein and generation
of protein for aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will complete a pre-clinical trial for the efficacy of this protein in treating a
mouse model of BMD. This aim will involve a preclinical efficacy trial for three doses of the protein in a mouse
model of BMD. Randomized cohorts of BMD mice will be treated with for 8-45 weeks and changes in the
dystrophy phenotype will be determined through various measurements of skeletal and cardiac muscle
structure and function. The deliverable for this aim will be to resolve if the protein can effectively treat a rodent
model of BMD. Aim 3 will conduct immunogenicity and toxicity studies for protein in mice. This assessment will
involve toxicity studies, including repeated-dose studies, toxicokinetic assessment, metabolic studies and
immunogenicity assessment, in BALB/c mice. These studies will be conducted at Myos and a CRO with a long
history of conducting such studies. The deliverable here will be completing these studies so the data can be
used to guide regulatory filings. Successful completion of this project will result in sufficient data to prepare an
IND application to the FDA for use in clinical trials for the treatment of BMD."
10912041,"Over half of the HIV-population in the United States is age 50 or older. Despite successful long-term
management of HIV/AIDS, older people with HIV (PLWH) often live with multiple age-related comorbidities, 4+
non-HIV conditions on average. Black and Latina women, in addition to being disproportionately affected by
HIV, typically have higher rates of multimorbidity. As a result, many women living with HIV (WLWH) require
informal caregiving or can anticipate needing care in the future to support complex care needs. Older WLWH
are an understudied group, as most HIV research targets men and younger people. Because older women of
color living with HIV have intersectional marginalized identities, they often experience difficulty in meeting their
needs for caregiving and support. The configuration of older WLWH's care networks, their effectiveness in
meeting older WLWH's care needs, and links to mental and behavioral health are major gaps in the HIV/AIDS
literature. Similarly, there is limited understanding of the evolution of care needs and informal care networks in
tandem over time, as well as the factors that shaped both in this population.
 This mixed-methods research seeks to use survey and interview data to investigate the adequacy of
older WLWH's care networks. Aim 1 will identify inadequate care networks among Black and Latina-identifying
women age 50 and older living with HIV and their association with mental and behavioral health using data
from a psychosocial and egocentric network survey. Aim 2 will probe participant perspectives on their own care
needs and resources, including informal and formal sources of support, and how these have changed over
time through a semi-structured life history interview. Aim 3 will corroborate care network patterns and the
factors associated with inadequate care networks across survey data and qualitative interviews.
 This research study is complemented by the career development plan which combines didactic and
experiential learning through interactions with a committee of experienced mentors who are leaders in HIV and
aging research to achieve four training aims: 1) acquire subject-matter expertise on WLWH; 2) expand skills in
survey research and mixed methods analysis; 3) obtain content knowledge about public health scientific
methods, namely causal inference; and 4) understand the translational research pipeline. The proposed
research and training plan will provide the candidate with the subject-matter expertise, community
partnerships, and methodological skills to conduct translational research in the HIV and aging field. This
research also lays the groundwork for a long-term research agenda aimed at better understanding of the
mechanisms whereby informal care networks operate across different populations of PLWH, and how to better
support these individuals, reduce health disparities, and promote healthy aging through the development of
targeted interventions."
10763394,"Project Summary / Abstract
Sepsis, Septic Shock, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
respiratory failure are among the top causes of hospital mortality, morbidity, and an increase in duration
and cost of hospitalization. Successful prevention and management of these conditions rely on the ability
of clinicians to estimate the risk, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent these events. Acute care settings
and in particular intensive care units (ICUs) provide an environment where an immense amount of data
is acquired, and it is expected that with the advent of wearables and biometric patches even more data
will be available in such settings. But at present, very little of these data are used effectively to
prognosticate, and the existing predictive analytics risk scores suffer from lack of generalizability across
institutions and performance degradation within the same institution over time.
The PIs on this proposal recently demonstrated that a Deep Learning-based algorithm can reliably
predict new sepsis cases in the emergency departments, general hospital wards, and ICUs by as much
as 4-6 hours in advance and an area under the curve (ROC) of 0.85-0.90. Furthermore, through a 2-year
pilot study funded via Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we recently
joined forces in a multicenter academic consortium to retrospectively validate this algorithm at each site.
Our collaboration has resulted in a multi-center longitudinal EHR dataset of critically ill patients and has
generated several important questions and findings related to design of portable and generalizable
predictive analytics algorithms that are robust to problems arising from gaps, errors, and biases in
electronic health records (EHRs) due to workflow-related factors (e.g. staffing-level), and heterogeneity
of patient populations and measurement devices.
We propose to significantly expand our prior work by designing new deep learning architectures that are
robust to data missingness and biases introduced through the variability in process of care, 2)
development of new learning methodologies to improve generalizability of the proposed models under
data/population drifts (aka distributional changes), 3) enhanced metadata design to assist in quantifying
`conditions for use' of such algorithms via algorithmic controls, and 4) HL7 and FHIR-based prospective
implementation and testing of these methodologies to provide real-world clinical evidence for the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Ultimately, these novel methodologies and tools will enhance
our ability to use EHR and other types of continuously measured longitudinal data to predict adverse
events, assess patients' response to therapy, and optimize and personalize care at the beside."
10763467,"Summary/Abstract Administrative Core #1
Resistance to our major antibiotics has been identified by the CDC as a major threat to the health and safety of
the American public. Two of the highest threat pathogens are Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
(CRAB) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Over the last decade, we have seen the emergence of novel
resistance mechanisms that have limited the utility of the antimicrobials that have served as the backbone of our
therapeutic armamentarium. This Proposal is a response by the call to action of the CDC, WHO and NIAID, with
their RFA-AI-16-081, where new tools were developed to help identify new agents and, as importantly, under-
stand, at the mechanistic level, how to translate combinations of agents to the clinic in order to maximize bacterial
killing and suppress resistance emergence. In addition, there has been increasing awareness of organism
state(s) such as tolerance/Non-Replicative Persister (NRP) Phenotype that allows these pathogens to evade the
lethal action of antimicrobial therapy. This problem is not genotypically driven. It is important to gain insight into
this phenomenon to allow us to design approaches that suppress the entry of organisms into this state and, if
already present in a larger organism population, create dosage regimens that efficiently kill them. We also intend
to examine the impact of time (as 4th dimension) on the expression of penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) and
resistance mechanisms to develop optimal dosage regimens for serious infections with a high bacterial burden.
This P01 will address these issues through three Projects and three Cores. Project #1 will examine CRAB and
CRKP under pressure from antimicrobials alone and in combination. We have developed a very high dimensional
mathematical model linking PBP occupancy patterns for combinations to rates and extent of kill and resistance
emergence. Project #2 will examine the best and less good regimens in the Hollow Fiber infection model (HFIM)
with the metrics of cell kill and resistance suppression. We will also look at metabolic states and expression of
resistance mechanisms. In Project #3, we will study these regimens in two murine models of pneumonia, granulo-
cyte-replete and granulocytopenic, to assess the impact of granulocytes on outcome. Both murine models and
the HFIM will be independent, prospective validation studies for Project #1 and allow model refinement. The
Cores will be the Administrative, Mechanistic Assay Core and Mathematical Modeling Core. The Administrative
Core will serve as the overall data repository and clearing house. It will facilitate transfer of information and
mutual communication amongst all Projects and Cores. It will also support monthly and yearly meetings (mostly
electronic) for evaluation and planning purposes. The Mechanistic Assay Core provides drug assays, proteo-
mics, whole genome sequencing, resistance assays, and flow cytometry (with sorting). Finally, the Mathematical
Modeling Core will develop high dimensional models that will integrate the experimental data from all Projects
and Cores to provide robust, optimal, and clinically relevant antibiotic dosage regimens against CRAB & CRKP."
10763470,"Project Summary/Abstract Project #1
Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) are bacterial “superbugs” listed in the highest
threat category (‘Urgent’) by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than
100,000 deaths per year are attributable to resistance in carbapenem-resistant isolates (i.e. CRAB and CRKP).
New antibiotics, such as β-lactam (BL) / β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) combinations, have become available to
combat CRKP. The combination of sulbactam with durlobactam to combat CRAB is currently under FDA review.
However, no clinically available BLI covers metallo-β-lactamases (MBL), which are often produced together with
OXA-enzymes in CRAB as well as with KPC and ESBL in CRKP. For serious infections, such as ventilator-
associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), the clinical outcomes remain suboptimal, even with this latest
generation of BL/BLI, especially for patients with a high bacterial burden. The BL have been used to successfully
treat infections by susceptible isolates of AB and KP for decades which clearly proves that the penicillin-binding
proteins (PBP; i.e. the high affinity targets of all BL) are highly valuable antibiotic targets. While it is known that
each BL inactivates one or multiple PBPs, which have different biochemical functions, our preliminary data
present the first comprehensive dataset on PBP binding of ≥45 BL and BLI in lysed cells of KP and AB. In our
Gram-negative toolbox R01 (AI136803), we created a series of target site penetration assays for PBP-binders
and other antibiotics, as well as intact-cell PBP binding assays that leverage ‘clickable’ probe BL. We further
developed a highly efficient approach to identify BL-induced bacterial morphology changes using automated
confocal microscopy and flow cytometry that can thereby reverse-engineer PBP occupancy patterns directly in
intact cells of CRAB and CRKP. We found that the expression of some PBPs changes extensively over time (i.e.
with growth phase). This may be important for serious infections with a high bacterial burden. Likewise, certain
non-essential PBPs are highly expressed and may serve as decoy targets that prevent BL and other PBP-binders
from inactivating the most important PBPs. Studies in Aim 1 of this Project (#1) will identify the optimal sets of
PBPs that need to be simultaneously inactivated to maximize killing of bacteria at high densities, including rapidly
and slowly replicating bacteria, as well as non-replicating persisters (NRP), which are hard to kill. In Aim 2, this
Project will further optimize strategies for maximizing PBP binding by partner antibiotics. We will use an
innovative combination of biochemical, molecular, chemical biology, and mathematical modeling approaches, in
close integration with the Mechanistic Assay Core #2 and the Mathematical Modeling Core #3. This will be greatly
facilitated by the Administrative Core #1. These novel mechanistic insights will underpin the translational
development and prospective validation of rationally optimized combination dosing strategies with new and
available BL, BLI, and non-β-lactam-PBP-binders, as well as other partner antibiotics in Projects #2 & #3."

Summary
Bloodstream infections in patients with sepsis symptoms should be promptly treated with
antibiotics; however, the time required to identify pathogens using methods based on blood
culture is a major obstacle to timely effective antimicrobial therapy. The development of a
comprehensive molecular assay capable of identifying microbes directly from whole blood has
been elusive despite major efforts due to the low concentration of microbes in the bloodstream
and the large number of microbial species that cause bloodstream infection (200+). We have
developed an automated assay that detects 13 bloodstream microbes directly in whole blood at
the low concentrations found in clinical samples, with LODs between 0.5 and 3 CFU/mL and a
turnaround time of 70 minutes. The assay performance is superior to other FDA cleared assays
for bloodstream pathogen detection. The new assay is based on Single MOLecule Tethering
(SMOLT), a novel sample preparation and amplification-free molecular detection technology
developed at Scanogen. Here, we propose to dramatically increase the multiplexing capacity of
SMOLT using a novel approach with the goal of producing a panel that covers the organisms
responsible for more than 99% of bloodstream infection cases (Aim 1). We will also integrate the
automated assay into a single disposable cartridge that will be processed by an easy-to-use and
fully automated desktop instrument (Aim 2). We will evaluate the new assay in pilot clinical studies
where we will directly compare the performance of the new assay to the standard of care
diagnostic test based on blood culture followed by mass spectroscopy (Aim 3). Each of these
specific aims has quantitative milestones.
Our long-term goal is the development of an FDA-cleared and CLIA-waived system; this project
is a critical step towards that goal. We will address the challenges of achieving the required level
multiplexing and assay integration, which are the most serious risks on the path to developing the
clinical system. We will work with a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in assay
development and instrument development, including the former Vice President of Engineering at
Becton Dickinson, experts in microbiology, sepsis diagnosis and treatment from Johns Hopkins
University and the University of Pittsburgh, as well as engineers from Key Technologies. After
completing this project, we will further optimize the system for usability and manufacturability and
conduct analytical and clinical studies for submission to the FDA. If successful, the new
automated assay can become part of the standard procedure for the diagnosis of patients
suspected of having sepsis. The new highly multiplexed assay will be useful in other applications
where rapid, cost-effective, and highly multiplexed molecular detection is needed."

Overview. This study addresses gaps in HIV and behavioral health research among older sexual minority men
(OSMM). Specifically, this project assesses the relative severity and impact of contextually relevant age-related
syndemic factors (age-related discrimination, internalized ageism, aging anxiety, sexual minority specific aging
concerns, social isolation, economic marginalization, and perceived cognitive impairment) and traditional
syndemic conditions (mental health via depression, PTSD, childhood sexual abuse; intimate partner violence;
substance use) among OSMM.9,10 Background. With high prevalence and rising incidence rates, OSMM are
uniquely burdened by HIV.1 This is particularly true for Florida (proposed study site), a state with one of the
highest HIV incidence rates nationally.11 The framework for the study is based on three relevant theories. First,
syndemic theory2 contends that HIV and quality of life (QOL) disparities are propagated by the synergistic co-
occurrence of disease (e.g., health issues, substance use behaviors, sociocultural factors), some of which are
unique to OSMM. Second, the minority stress model3,4 extends syndemic theory by positing that OSMM face
enduring unique stressors resulting from their marginalized identities that perpetuate psychological adversity.
Lastly, intersectionality theory5 posits that OSMM experience worse health outcomes compared to their
younger SMM peers due to the compounding systems of oppression they face due to their multiple minoritized
identities. Objectives & methods. This study’s three aims center on investigating the relative severity and
impact of age-related psychosocial factors and traditional syndemic conditions in explaining HIV and health
disparities among HIV-negative OSMM. Aim 1 examines the severity, frequency, and co-occurrence of
theoretically linked psychosocial problems occurring in HIV-negative OSMM. Aim 2 assesses the influence of
age-related psychosocial and traditional syndemic conditions on engagement in HIV prevention outcomes
(condomless anal sex without PrEP, PrEP adherence) and QOL among this population of OSMM as well as a
potential moderator of these relationships. Aim 3 utilizes tree-based-machine learning to explore interaction
effects between the most influential age-related psychosocial factors and an additive index of traditional
syndemic conditions on HIV risk and QOL outcomes. HIV-negative OSMM (N = 250) between the ages of 55
and 70 years will complete one psychosocial quantitative assessment. Data will be analyzed using tree-based-
machine learning approaches and traditional regression models. Innovation and Impact. This dissertation
study will identify age-related syndemic conditions unique to OSMM to better understand QOL, HIV, and
behavioral health, among OSMM, an under-researched and multiple marginalized group. Findings gleaned will
aid in the future development of HIV and behavioral health related tailored to OSMM and, as a dissertation, lay
the groundwork for the PI’s programmatic research focused on HIV and behavioral health disparities among
older sexual minorities. This proposal is relevant to the NIDA priorities (NOT-MD-19-001)."
10763689,"ABSTRACT
Precision medicine is an emerging integrative approach for disease prevention, early detection and treatment
that takes into account individual variability in genetics, medical history, environmental exposures, and lifestyle.
Effective precision medicine requires the integration and analysis of complex clinical and molecular data. The
BDI Core will help researchers take advantage of state-of-the-art computational resources for the study of SLE.
The coordination of different data types – clinical, genomics, cellular, and molecular – throughout the process of
data generation and analysis is a critical function that will be accomplished by interactions between the Core and
the Project teams. The goal of the Biostatistics and Data Integration (BDI) Core is to provide researchers with
state-of-the-art computational approaches for the study of SLE. Directed by leading experts in computational
biology and bioinformatics, the BDI Core will provide investigators with assistance in study design; bioinformatics
analysis of clinical and imaging features and bulk- and single-cell omics data; data integration; and data
dissemination across the two proposed projects. The BDI Core will capitalize on our collective experience
analyzing clinical, molecular, immune, and metabolic data in the context of autoimmune disease; our expertise
in multi-modal data analysis methods; and the infrastructure of the UCSF Data Library to support the data
management and analytic efforts of this proposal. In order to provide comprehensive support for data
management and analysis, the BDI Core will; (1) provide necessary bioinformatic processing and statistical
learning support for both projects; and (2) perform integrative analyses to power the multi-modal nature of each
project as well as joint cross-project dataset analyses; (3) establish a robust and secure data storage system
shared across project teams using the UCDL infrastructure. To advance SLE research in the context of precision
medicine, the BDI Core will work in collaboration with the project leaders and investigators to provide tools and
workflows for the analysis and integration of high quality genomic, molecular and clinical data. With those goals
in mind we propose the following tasks: 1) Provide statistical analysis and bioinformatic support for testing project
hypotheses relevant to immune phenotypes and brain functioning in SLE remission. 2) Integrate multi-modal
data to identify defining states of SLE remission based on immune and neurological phenotypes and 3) Develop
and maintain a centralized system of data management and sharing using the UCSF Data Library. The BDI Core
will bring together researchers from different backgrounds and enable investigators whose work can benefit from
access to state-of-the-art computational technologies and approaches, with an overall goal of advancing
precision medicine in rheumatology."
10763692,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Fungal Colonization Resistance (FunCoRe) Program Project “Understanding the molecular mechanisms
regulating fungal colonization and disease in the mammalian intestinal niche” focuses on developing an
integrated and predictive model of the molecular, cellular, and metabolic determinants of Candida
gastrointestinal (GI) colonization and its relationship to life-threatening invasive candidiasis. FunCoRE consists
of 3 projects and 3 cores and combines in-depth studies of hematopoietic cell transplant patients with
defined Candida colonization phenotypes and curated clinical data with experiments in reductionist experimental
models of Candida GI colonization. The patient cohort serves as a source for a large Candida strain collection
and for fecal metabolite abundance measurements that are harnessed in projects and cores. Project 1
emphasizes the role of morphology, virulence factors, and strain-specific genomic features on C. albicans and C.
parapsilosis GI colonization. Project 2 characterizes immune signaling pathways and cell types (Paneth cells,
innate lymphoid cells) that mediate Candida colonization resistance. Project 3 focuses on the bacterial microbiota
and their biosynthetic capabilities, with a focus on short- and medium-chain fatty acids, to determine direct and
indirect mechanisms of colonization resistance. A Gnotobiotic Core enables deep mechanistic dissection of the
contribution of individual molecular, cellular, immune pathways, and commensal bacteria to colonization
phenotypes. A Mathematical Modeling Core ties all 3 projects together and will generate predictive models
of Candida GI colonization that incorporate specific fungal attributes, the bacterial microbiota and metabolites,
and host immune parameters. Modeling outputs will be iteratively tested and refined in collaboration with the
experimental projects to explore the overall hypothesis that the synergy of experimental and modeling
approaches will reveal fungal, immune-mediated, and metabolic determinants of Candida GI colonization and
colonization resistance which can inform and be harnessed for therapeutic strategies to limit invasive candidiasis.
Aim 1 will investigate the Candida functional capacities that promote GI colonization; Aim 2 will interrogate host
cell networks and colonization-relevant metabolites at the host-Candida interface; Aim 3 will develop an
integrative model of Candida colonization resistance that identifies ecologic, immune, and metabolic targets to
restore and enhance Candida colonization resistance. Successful completion of these aims will be supported by
a strong Administrative Core management plan to facilitate communication and collaboration between projects
and cores. The breadth and complementarity of expertise, multidisciplinary approaches, track record of
collaboration, and commitment to establish a mentored undergraduate internship program represent signature
features of FunCoRe. Insights will inform benchtop-to-bed strategies to formulate novel interventions that can
shape the fungal communities in the GI niche to prevent invasive candidiasis and improve patient outcomes."
10763695,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The major goal of the Mathematical Modeling Core is to develop mathematical models of biological processes
that will help us better understand 1) the link between a Candida species/strain and its metabolic phenotype; 2),
the role of commensal bacteria in resisting fungal colonization; and 3) the role of host immune effectors against
candidemia (bloodstream infections). The models will integrate data produced by the experimental projects of
this Program Project. We will collaborate closely with experimentalists in Projects 1-3 to test our models’
predictions, to use models in designing new experiments and to improve the quality of our models iteratively. As
such, we will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop multi-strain genome-scale metabolic networks
of Candida albicans (Ca) and Candida parapsilosis (Cp) to identify metabolic mechanisms related to
morphological switching, gut colonization and virulence. We will utilize data (whole genome sequences, BIOLOG
profiling, morphology and mouse colonization phenotypes from Ca and Cp) to generate multi-strain genome
reconstructions of Candida using flux balance analysis to compute metabolic fluxes. Model predictions will be
validated with fluxes measured experimentally by stable isotope tracing and refined iteratively. In Aim 2, we will
develop a mechanistic model of intestinal microbiome ecology to identify microbiome mechanisms of resistance
against Candida colonization. We will incorporate data generated from Project 3 (including metagenomic and
metabolomic data from preclinical models and a human cohort) to create mechanistic models of gut microbiota
cross-feeding that will be expanded using whole genome reconstruction networks of Lachnospiraceae to study
the metabolites produced and consumed by and their role in resisting Ca/Cp colonization. In Aim 3, we will
model the dynamics of host immune system to identify effectors against bloodstream translocation. In synergy
with Project 2 (utilizing human cohort and preclinical data), we will generate two models: an immunity-microbiome
interaction model and an immunity-Candida translocation model. The immunity-microbiome interaction model
will use Bayesian inference with large patient datasets to pinpoint the microbiota components most relevant for
immune effector dynamics. The immunity-Candida model will be developed using mouse data, by colonizing
different levels of Ca and Cp to measure immune cell counts when translocation occurs or not. The two models
will be combined to study the links between the gut microbiome and Candida translocation via the immune
effector dynamics."
10763698,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The major goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and/or microbiota-
derived metabolites modulate Candida colonization in the mammalian gut. While it has long been appreciated
that intestinal bacteria and more recently bacterial-derived metabolites likely play a role in Candida colonization
resistance (CCR), there is a key knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms by which specific gut
microbiota and/or microbiota-derived metabolites impact CCR.
In preliminary data presented in this proposal, we show that unbiased in vitro and in vivo screening approaches
led to the identification of both short-chain fatty acids, SCFA, and medium chain fatty acids, MCFAs, as being
significantly associated with CCR in mice. We further validated that specific SCFAs inhibit Candida growth in
vitro and inhibited Candida albicans (Ca) GI colonization in mice. Select SCFAs inhibit Ca glucose uptake and
downregulate genes important for glucose metabolism. Pilot microbiome and metabolomic profiling data
generated from fecal samples collected from human allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) patients
demonstrated a reduction in fecal SCFA abundance and linked this reduction to C. parapsilosis (Cp) intestinal
domination in the clinic.
Thus, our central hypothesis is that gut microbiota-derived metabolites (i.e., SCFAs/MCFAs) impede Candida
growth directly by inhibition of fungal glucose metabolism and restrict GI colonization indirectly via the induction
of host immune effectors (including antimicrobial peptides) that target fungal cells. In Aim 1, we will determine
the mechanisms by which SCFA/MCFA directly inhibit Candida growth by using functional metabolomic profiling
studies to examine levels of glucose-derived metabolites, glycolytic intermediates, and TCA cycle intermediates,
and complementary unbiased proteomics and metabolomic studies will be utilized to assess other metabolite-
based mechanisms of direct inhibition. In Aim 2, we will assess the effect of SCFAs/MCFAs on induction of
immune effectors in intestinal epithelial cells and innate immune cells. In Aim 3, we will define the role of the
microbiome/metabolome in modulating Cp GI colonization by perform unbiased microbiome and metabolomic
profiling of our human allo-HCT fecal specimen library to identify associations between candidate taxa,
metabolite mediators and Cp colonization phenotypes. We will also utilize complementary preclinical models in
parallel to address molecular mechanisms of CCR."
10763716,"Overall Abstract
Little is known about the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN), particularly as it relates to the initiation and
propagation of the inflammatory response which accounts for the development or end stage renal disease. LN
may complicate up to two thirds of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with higher rates commonly
seen among minorities and children. Besides the needle kidney biopsy, we lack tools that reflect tissue
pathology with fidelity. Although two drugs have been recently approved to treat patients with LN, all treatment
protocols involve systemic administration of drugs or biologics which are laden with side effects and limited
clinical efficacy. Ample evidence has revealed that kidney resident cells and newly formed high endothelial
venules in the presence of an autoinflammatory environment, upregulate molecules which account for the
ensuing inflammation and cell damage, while in their absence, kidney damage is averted. These molecular
changes can be recorded in parallel in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells in the urine. This proposal will
test the hypothesis that interaction of constituents of the immune system with kidney resident cells and the
ectopically formed high endothelial venules, determines the development of inflammation and injury in the
setting of LN. Corollaries of this hypothesis are that kidney resident cells can serve as gateways for the
administration of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of LN and that kidney tissue pathology can be
recorded with high fidelity in the urine cells of patients with LN. There are 2 projects in this proposal: 1)
Interplay between autoimmune effectors and kidney resident cells in lupus nephritis and 2) Newly formed high
endothelial cells in the kidney- pathogenesis and implications in lupus nephritis. The proposal will be supported
by 3 cores: The Administrative Core will be responsible for regulatory compliance, budget management,
scheduling meetings. The Nanoparticle Immune Delivery Core will be responsible for the construction of
nanoparticles loaded with drugs and biologics and tagged with antibodies for cell-specific delivery. The Single
Cell, Spatial Transcriptomics and Bioinformatics Core will perform single cell transcriptomics studies and will
provide statistical and bioinformatics support. This proposal through extensive synergistic plans between the
project leaders brings forward novel and significant elements in the study of the pathogenesis, treatment and
biomarker development in patients with LN."
10763718,"CORE B - ABSTRACT
Despite advancements in the development of immunosuppressive agents, the management of lupus nephritis
(LN) remains challenging. Although newer classes of immune therapeutics (ITs) have been developed, their
overall efficacy remains virtually unchanged. More intense IT regimens create serious complications, including
infection, malignancy, metabolic disorders, and microvascular toxicity. In general, these toxicities contribute to
accelerated cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in patients with LN. Therefore, the development
of more effective targeted ITs is a major unmet medical need. The field of nanotechnology has generated
significant interest in medicine with inherent capacity to increase therapeutic efficacy due to delivery of a higher
dose of these payloads to the site of tissue injury (e.g., kidney in LN), minimizing their systemic toxicity by limiting
the dose needed to obtain the optimal clinical effect. As the vast majority of nanotherapeutics developed thus far
have focused primarily on cancer treatment, nanotherapeutics remain to be developed for LN. This Core is built
on significant data generated by the teams of Drs. Abdi and Tsokos teams to build nanoimmune therapeutics and
their application in LN. The hypothesis of Core B is that targeted delivery of ITs through the newly formed high
endothelial venules (HEVs) of the kidneys permits more effective suppression of effector immunity within the
kidneys of patients with LN. Furthermore, nanomedicine can reduce the necessary dose of ITs to induce LN
remission and thereby reduce their off-target toxicity. Intrarenal inflammation is a defining feature for LN, relying
mainly on the homing of immune cells to the kidney. Therefore, the development of kidney-targeted delivery of
ITs to suppress intrarenal inflammation is a key unmet clinical need. A major finding in our preliminary data is the
development of newly made high HEVs in the LN kidneys. HEVs are specialized veins responsible for the
homing of naive T cells that express exclusively a series of glycoproteins on their surfaces known as
node addressin (PNAd). Here, we use a well-established nanodelivery strategy in which the surfaces
peripheral
of
nanoparticles are conjugated with a highly specific mAb called MECA79 that recognizes PNAd on the surface of
HEVs. Using this highly innovative strategy, we can encapsulate a wide variety of payloads inside the
nanoparticles, including immunosuppressive drugs and mAb. Pursuing our data, the main goal of Core B is to
synthesize and characterize antibody-conjugated nanocarriers of an inhibitor of CaMK4 and gRNAs (for specific
targets such as CaMK4 and IL-23R) (Project 1), and anti-CD3 and anti-IL23 (for Project 2). Core B will work
synergistically with both projects to not only synthesize these nanotherapeutics, but also to provide a number of
dye-containing nanoparticles for assessment of their trafficking to the kidneys and peripheral tissues. Core B will
also assess the release kinetics of payloads from the nanoparticles in vitro. Through close interactions with both
Projects 1 and 2, Core B will assist in the development of additional combinatorial nanotherapeutics."

The proposed multi-disciplinary Program Project Grant (PPG) will utilize interdisciplinary expertise, key
established resources, cutting-edge technologies, and extensive in vivo and human studies to bypass
substantial roadblocks in our understanding, management, and treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). Core C will
leverage already established extensive resources, specialized personnel, infrastructure, and expertise to
address effectively and efficiently sample processing, data generation, ingestion, and integration, major
bottlenecks in spatial/single cell profiling. Core C will prioritize data provenance and best practices,
ascertaining that all activities adhere to the FAIR principles across the data life cycle. Core C will ensure
streamlined data generation, acquisition, quality control, management, and provenance across the PPG,
achieved through 3 distinct aims: the generation of production-grade highly automated single cell and spatial
tissue profiling data (Aim 1), the establishment of streamlined data processing, quality control, management,
and provenance (Aim 2); and the promotion of best practice, scalable, multi-modal data processing, analysis,
and integration (Aim 3).
The Core will work closely with the personnel of the Administrative Core, the Cores, and the Projects for
efficient and timely data delivery. The rich metadata captured across all activities, along with versions, code,
and extensive provenance activities, will ascertain that all datapoints adhere to the FAIR principles. By
centralizing high throughput assay performance, bioinformatics, and biostatistics the Core enables uniform
best practice analyses across all activities, effective data integration, seamless reuse, interoperability, and
cost-effectiveness.
All pipelines and protocols will be shared to facilitate the community to recreate findings and build upon this
effort. Wherever possible, pipelines will be provided as complete workflows or containers for easy deployment
in diverse environments. We will build upon our experience of implementing production grade assays and
impactful bioinformatics/data resources that are trusted by researchers worldwide."
10907817,"Abstract: Persons living with HIV experience constant stigma and discrimination. The project objective is to
model the impact of the psychosocial experiences of stigma/discrimination on the complex interactions between
multiple systems (neural, immune, and autonomic) that give rise to atherosclerotic processes in the context of
treated chronic HIV-infection. This project assembles a multi-disciplinary team that will decipher the complexity
of these interactions within a cohort of 150 racially, ethnically, and sexually diverse persons living with HIV (PWH)
between the ages of 35-55 years that have stable anti-retroviral regimens and detectable viral loads without
history of heart failure. The study aims to test two separate psycho-neuro-immune mediation models for
experiences of social rejection and discrimination on carotid plaque formation measured through high resolution
ultrasound. In the first model, using an interactive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm,
change from pre- to post-task peripheral blood monocyte activation and expression of IL-6 will be tested as a
mediator of the association between activation of threat-sensitive brain regions to social rejection and carotid
plaque formation. In the second model, 7-day salivary IL-6 expression will be tested as mediator for the
association of 7-day ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of everyday experiences of discrimination with
carotid plaque formation. The reliability of these models of putative psycho-neuro-immune mechanisms in
predicting carotid plaque burden will be assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. The study further aims to
evaluate the potential mitigating role of the acetyl-cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway on carotid plaque
formation by testing whether an index of vagal-mediated heart rate variability (HRV) moderates of the
associations of neural activation to rejection/discrimination (Aim 1) and naturalistic rejection/discrimination
experiences (Aim 2) with change in proinflammatory cytokine expression. The long-term objectives of this study
are two-fold. First, to elucidate the relationships amongst these biobehavioral determinants of carotid plaque
formation in PWH, who are traditionally stigmatized and discriminated due to intersectionality of their race,
ethnicity, gender, health, and sexual orientation status. The second long-term objective is to evaluate whether
vagal-mediated HRV has a mitigating effect and thus serve as a target for future biobehavioral interventions for
atherosclerotic CVD in PWH that have traditionally been socially marginalized, stigmatized and discriminated."

Influenza virus is a serious public health threat causing high levels of morbidity and mortality. The annual disease
burden from influenza places a significant strain on our healthcare infrastructure and economy. This is despite
many efforts to control disease with yearly vaccination, antiviral drug therapies, and other medical and public
health interventions. To address the continuing health and economic costs, there is a clear need to better
understand the molecular mechanisms of influenza virus replication and how these can be manipulated for
therapeutic benefit. Influenza virus exploits, and in some cases subverts, cellular factors and pathways to
promote replication. We identified RNA:protein interactions between viral and host partners that impact innate
immune responses during infection. We showed IFIT2 is a critical cellular protein that binds viral mRNAs to
enhance replication. This was surprising, as IFIT2 is one of the first proteins expressed in response to viral
infection and displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of IFIT2,
and how this is co-opted into a proviral effector by influenza virus, are not yet known. We also showed that
influenza nucleoprotein (NP) is a key viral protein that binds host RNAs. This assigns a new activity to NP that
our data suggest is part of a previously unappreciated strategy to dampen innate immune responses. The overall
goal of this application is to determine how these RNA:protein complexes composed of both viral and host
components manipulate innate immune responses to support viral replication. In Aim 1, we investigate how IFIT2
functions as a front-line defender in a broadly acting antiviral response. We hypothesize that IFIT2 enhances
translation of antiviral proteins, an event that is repurposed by influenza virus to promote production of viral
proteins. We test this using experiments that investigate the processes by which IFIT2 engages target RNAs,
affects translation of its bound mRNAs, and alters infection. Aim 2 interrogates the impact of interactions between
viral NP and host RNAs. This aim proposes that NP:RNA complexes moderate innate immune responses. We
investigate this by studying RNAs and infection-induced events that activate innate immune pathways, and
discern the impact on viral replication. The results from this proposal will establish a mechanistic understanding
of the viral and host factors regulating innate immune responses and how influenza virus tips the balance to
favor replication. Moreover, while our studies focus on influenza virus, the underlying mechanisms we discover
will have broad impacts on the general understanding of host antiviral responses and unexpected strategies
used by viruses to counteract them. Completion of this proposal will provide fundamental knowledge that can
contribute to new therapeutic approaches or cellular targets that can be exploited for the rational development
of anti-influenza virus therapies."
10763879,"Overall Summary/Abstract
This Outstanding Investigator Award R35 program addresses previously-unexplored mechanisms by which
regulation of gene expression at the translational level controls the functions of megakaryocytes and platelets,
in the setting of health and disease. Studies will employ basic and clinical investigations in humans and mice to
comprehensively determine how translational pathways that converge on Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E
(eIF4E) regulate megakaryocyte and platelet biology. Roles for translational control pathways in
megakaryocytes have not previously been studied, their functional significance in circulating platelets is
uncertain, and it is unknown how disease situations alter translational responses of megakaryocytes and
platelets. Thus, successful completion of the research objectives will fill key gaps in knowledge that need to be
addressed in heart, lung, and blood research. Results generated will also determine if translational control
pathway inhibitors, which are currently being tested in the clinic, have off-target effects on megakaryocytes and
platelets."
10894846,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Administrative Core
The Administrative Core for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP)
CoBRE will continue to provide the following specific aims: (1) infrastructure for programmatic development
and oversight; (2) an integrated training and mentoring plan for Research Project Leaders (RPLs); (3)
operational support of RPL and Pilot Project Investigator (PPI) day-to-day operations; and (4) management of
the Pilot Project program. The basic premise of NeuroMAP Administrative Core is that a supportive framework
is necessary to create a strong, interdisciplinary, translational team of junior investigators to transition to R-
level competitive researchers. NeuroMAP Phase I Administrative Core accomplishments facilitated by the
strategic/scientific oversight of the Leadership Team and Advisory Committee (AC) include: (1) the foundation
of a supportive base and training platform for five RPLs during Years 1-3, three RPLs during Years 4-5, and
eight PPIs; (2) successful matching of External Mentors with extensive R01-level funding experience to RPLs
to facilitate career development; (3) four funded R01s by NeuroMAP investigators (two RPLs and two PPIs)
and 14 grant applications submitted by PPIs; (4) active integration of NeuroMAP into the local academic
community via participation from Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and University of Tulsa
faculty; and (5) successful recruitment of junior investigators to apply for Pilot Projects. During Phase I, the AC
made various suggestions to improve NeuroMAP Phase II, which included: (1) tighter focus on grants that can
be applied for based on RPL data; (2) increased statistical consultation; (3) expanding biological assessments
beyond neuroimaging; (4) consideration of local mentors for RPLs and PPIs. As a result, Phase II adds the
following infrastructure developments: (1) past NeuroMAP RPLs and PPIs who earned R01-level funding will
now serve as Internal Mentors to current RPLs; (2) availability of Phase I NeuroMAP multilevel Core data
(neuroimaging, behavior, questionnaires, clinical assessments) for new Pilot Projects, thereby facilitating
hypothesis testing for future R01 grant applications; (3) successful recruitment of Dr. Wesley Thompson, a
statistician with a successful track record of R01-level funding who will guide RPLs and PPIs in data analysis
planning/execution; and (4) expansion of training opportunities to include research involving blood-based
biomarker and genetic data processing and analysis. Accomplishing these aims of the Administrative Core will
extend the critical mass of independent investigators necessary for the theme of NeuroMAP to continue to
receive NIH funding and identify new treatment targets to reduce the personal, financial and societal burden of
mood and anxiety disorders."
10894847,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Recruitment and Assessment Core
Psychiatric research relies on the use of validated and reliable self-report, interview-based, and behavioral
assessments to diagnose DSM-5 psychiatric disorders, estimate level of severity of mental health symptoms,
and to delineate transdiagnostic constructs of relevance across disorders. The Recruitment and Assessment
Core of the Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) in Phase
II will support Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot Project Investigators (PPIs) by overseeing and
completing the recruitment, screening, and common Core interview-based, self-report, and behavioral
assessment procedures. The goal of the Recruitment and Assessment Core is to accelerate the RPL and
PPI projects by allowing for efficient participant recruitment and more rapid data collection, aiding in the
formulation of aims and hypotheses based on core data, and thereby making R-level grant applications more
competitive. The Recruitment and Assessment Core will work closely with the Circuits and Molecules Core
to support a multi-level assessment approach (symptoms & behavior, circuits & physiology, cells &
molecules) and is structured to support the NeuroMAP theme: identification and validation, via an
experimental approach, of targetable disease-modifying processes (DMPs) in mood and anxiety disorders.
During Phase I, common data elements were established across all RPL projects and provided a balance
between the research goals of the individual RPL projects and secondary data analyses for PPIs. During this
phase, the Core was able to recruit 552 participants for RPLs and each project reached recruitment
milestones despite SARS-CoV-2 and a two-month shutdown of the institute. Moreover, 8 PPI used the Core
data to identify novel DMPs in mood and anxiety disorders. The Core focuses on measures derived from a
modified NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach: (a) Negative Valence Systems measures, i.e., how
individuals respond to aversive situations or context (RPL Project 1 focuses on threat sensitivity; Project 2
focuses on avoidance behavior, Project 3 focuses on repetitive negative thinking); (b) Positive Valence
Systems measures, i.e., how individuals respond to positive motivational situations or contexts (Project 2 will
focus on approach motivation); (c) Interoception measures, i.e. sensing, processing, and integrating internal
bodily signals together with external stimuli to affect motivated behavior (Project 2 focuses on responses to
interoceptive perturbation). The aims of the core are (1) to provide timely recruitment and standardized
assessments for all NeuroMAP projects; (2) to maintain a reproducible and reliable assessment structure
that can be used for extramurally supported projects; and (3) to develop a self-sustainable business plan for
the user base. The Core will be a unique resource for LIBR investigators as well as researchers at other
academic institutions in northeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas."
10894849,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Circuits and Molecules Core
The Circuits and Molecules (C&M) Core of the Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and
Prediction (NeuroMAP) in Phase II will support Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot Project
Investigators (PPIs) by overseeing the acquisition, storage, and analysis of biological samples and
neuroimaging data. The first goal of the C&M Core is to accelerate the RPL and PPI projects by (a) providing
the necessary expertise in neuroimaging and molecular biology to ensure the success of NeuroMAP projects
and (b) aiding in the formulation of new aims and hypotheses based on common core data elements (CDE) to
make R-level grant applications more competitive. The second goal of C&M Core is to develop self-sufficiency
so that it can ultimately serve as a resource for the broader geographical region. To achieve this goal, the C&M
Core will develop a detailed business plan with cost estimates to support sustainability beyond the CoBRE.
The C&M Core will work together with the Recruitment and Assessment Core and the Data Management and
Statistics Core to support the NeuroMAP theme: the identification and validation, via an experimental
approach, of targetable disease-modifying processes (DMPs) in mood and anxiety disorders. During Phase I, a
set of CDE was established across all projects and provided a balance between the research goals of the
individual RPL projects and secondary data analyses for PPIs. During that Phase, more than 350
neuroimaging assessments were obtained consisting of a standard structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, a
resting state MRI, and several functional MRI tasks. Similarly, blood samples from over 350 participants were
collected to measure a range of circulating inflammatory mediators. In Phase II, the C&M Core will work with
the Recruitment and Assessment Core to collect a new imaging and laboratory data set that can be used by
RPLs to extend their projects and PPIs to identify new DMPs. The imaging and laboratory measures were
selected to delineate process dysfunctions by individuals with mood and anxiety disorders in the (a) Negative
Valence domain i.e., how individuals respond to aversive contexts, (b) Positive Valence domain i.e., how
individuals respond to positive contexts and (c) Interoception domain i.e., the processing of internal bodily
signals to affect behavior. These measures will be optimized in Phase II. Advanced sequences to measure
myelin content and neuroinflammation (restricted diffusion imaging) will be added to the Circuit component
while the Molecules component will focus on the measurement of microRNA and proteins from astrocyte-
enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs), building on our recent publications in this area. The C&M Core will be led
by Co-Directors, Drs. Rohan and Savitz with the support of Ms. Arterbury and Drs. Burrows and Misaki. Drs.
Savitz and Burrows (molecules component) will also liaise closely with Dr. Teague, director of the Integrative
Immunology Center at the University of Oklahoma."
10894851,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Data Management and Statistics Core
A 3-year project for a Research Project Leader (RPL) to conduct experimental human subjects research with
psychiatric target populations and to obtain pilot data for an R-level grant can be challenging from a design,
data management and processing, and statistical analysis perspective. The Data Management and Statistics
(DMS) Core will ensure the highest rigor of study design, the implementation of community-standard data
management and processing protocols, and the application of cutting-edge data science algorithms that
maximize out-of-sample prediction performance and power for assessing mechanisms of action. The Core will
work with RPLs and pilot project investigators to facilitate identifying and validating disease-modifying
processes (DMPs) that are relevant for mood and anxiety disorders. This will greatly enhance the utility of the
research produced by RPLs for use in formulating aims and developing hypotheses based on these
preliminary data and for designing future studies, thereby making R01-level applications more likely to succeed
as well as being more competitive and fundable. Services provided by this Core consist of: (1) consultations
with expert data scientists who will work with investigators to develop and instantiate an operating environment
that optimizes data use and analytics; and (2) procedures and programs developed by this Core to
accommodate users' stimulus presentation, data management and statistical needs. The data management
component will be instrumental in guaranteeing that data are acquired and processed reliably and efficiently
using our scalable data management infrastructure. Services will begin at study setup and include
implementation and configuration of behavioral paradigms, pipelines to convert raw data into standard (e.g.,
Brain Imaging Data Structure: BIDS) format, periodic auditing and sharing as needed. This Core will provide
standard pipelines to extract common data elements and quality metrics and to facilitate access and usage of
the institute's computing infrastructure. The statistics component of the Core will focus on developing study
designs and analytic procedures applicable to assessing unbiased effects and predictive performance of DMPs
(e.g., threat sensitivity, avoidance during aversive interoception, repetitive negative thinking) on mental health
outcomes. As these DMPs will be examined on several levels of analysis (symptoms, behavior, physiology,
circuits, and molecules), study designs and analyses will need to integrate complex multi-method associations
and will need to account for potential biases in associations, e.g., due to selection, measurement error, and/or
confounding. This Core will focus on multilevel models, causal inference and machine learning prediction that
account for sources of variation (e.g., nested data) and confounding (e.g., confounding bias) while providing
maximal explanatory and out-of-sample prediction performance. The products of this Core will be instrumental
in developing follow-up R-level research leveraging data produced by NeuroMAP projects."
10894860,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 3 – Tsuchiyagaito
Major Depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most common mental health conditions in young adulthood
(ages 18-25) occurring in 11%, and has serious effects on long-term outcomes such as comorbid mental
disorders, unemployment and suicide, if not effectively treated. Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a
recurrent thought process which is negative in valence and difficult to control. RNT is consistently linked to a
higher frequency, duration, and severity of depression, and also predicts suicidality in early adulthood.
Although effective treatments for MDD have been established, nearly two-thirds of patients will not respond,
and treatment of MDD with currently available modalities leave as many as 90% with residual symptoms,
including RNT. Higher RNT is also linked to a slower response and poorer outcome to both antidepressant
medication and psychotherapy. Thus, RNT and the underlying neural circuit would be ideal to be directly
targeted and it would boost the relevant regulatory brain functions. Real-time functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training is an ideal, non-invasive method to translate RNT-related brain
networks into a targetable disease-modifying process. This proposal builds on our previous work, in which we
identified the brain functional connectivity associated with RNT, i.e., we determined that the connectivity
between the right anterior insular (rAI) and the right superior temporal sulcus (rSTS) was positively correlated
with higher RNT in individuals with MDD. In this proposal, we use rtfMRI-nf to causally relate the dysfunction of
rAI-rSTS connectivity with the intensity of RNT. We will conduct a randomized double-blind, sham-controlled
trial of rtfMRI-nf in n=110 (n=100 completers, assuming a 10% attrition) young adult MDD individuals (ages 18-
25) with RNT symptoms. We will evaluate how rtfMRI-nf can be used to attenuate RNT, and thereby reduce
depression. We aim to investigate the degree to which reducing rAI-rSTS connectivity alleviates RNT and
depressive symptoms in young adults with MDD receiving active rtfMRI-nf (n=55, 50 completers) compared to
sham (neurofeedback with artificially generated feedback signals; n=55, 50 completers) groups. Specific aims
are to determine (1) an acute effect of real vs. sham rtfMRI-nf on rAI-rSTS functional connectivity; (2) and on
RNT and depression. An exploratory aim will examine the degree to which acute modulation of rAI-rSTS
connectivity leads to changes in RNT as well as depression and sub-acute rAI-rSTS connectivity change one
week after rtfMRI-nf. The overarching goal is to establish that (1) rAI-rSTS connectivity is involved in RNT and
can be modulated as a targetable disease-modifying process of MDD, and (2) by modulating rAI-rSTS
connectivity to reduce RNT we can reduce depression severity. The systematic approach of this proposal
embodies the goals of the NIH RDoC Initiative by identifying a neural target for a transdiagnostic construct, and
studying the brain-behavioral function relationships with the direct modulation of a specific network."
10763819,"Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A streptococcus (GAS), is a major human pathogen
that causes significant morbidity and mortality. GAS infections can lead to several disease conditions
including rheumatic heart disease (RHD), the major cause of acquired heart disease in children.
Globally, at least 34 million people living with RHD causing 345,000 deaths per year. Thus, the
development of a human GAS vaccine remains a healthcare priority. However, a broadly protective
licensed GAS vaccine remains elusive due to the antigenic variation in vaccine candidates among
different GAS serotypes, genetic diversity of the pathogen, and cross-reactivity of antibodies against
GAS antigens with human tissues. To overcome these challenges and protect public health from GAS
diseases, it is critical to identify novel vaccine targets and/or develop new vaccination strategies that
produce broad and effective protection against GAS diseases. Our recent studies demonstrated that
the highly conserved bacterial metal acquisition systems are critical virulence determinants and
effective vaccine targets capable of conferring cross-serotypic protection against GAS diseases. The
metal importers compete with host nutritional immune mechanisms to acquire metals during infection
and promote bacterial survival in hostile host environments. Host deploys nutritional immune
mechanisms, as components of innate immunity, to retard microbial growth by nutrient deprivation.
GAS infected abscesses are enriched with host factor, calprotectin (CP), which sequesters Zn from the
colonization surfaces to limit GAS growth. However, GAS withstands CP onslaught and successfully
replicates in the host by employing the high-affinity Zn importer, AdcABC. A major caveat to this model
is that, in GAS and other gram-positive bacteria, the cell membrane-bound AdcABC-like importers are
buried underneath the thick cell wall layer. The masked subcellular localization of AdcABC fails to
explain its function as a competitive Zn uptake mechanism against the efficient host nutritional defenses
and its efficacy as a vaccine target. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the
mechanisms by which GAS uses AdcA to evade host nutritional defenses, and evaluate novel AdcA-
based vaccination strategies for its protective efficacy against human-like GAS infections. Using a
multidisciplinary approach, we will test the central hypothesis of this proposal that GAS uses non-
replicating, cell-free membrane vesicles (MV) coated with AdcABC for Zn acquisition and subverts CP-
mediated Zn limitation. At the completion of the proposed study, the mechanistic basis for MV-mediated
GAS Zn acquisition will be delineated and protective efficacy of protein- and MV-based AdcA
vaccination for GAS disease prevention will be assessed."
10763823,"Summary
Integrin-based adhesions are central to the functions of blood and vascular cells. The
heterogeneity of adhesions and their dynamic evolution has complicated efforts to study their fine
composition, assembly, and disassembly. Our studies have shown that a transition between two
adhesion archetypes is controlled by a simple binary molecular switch of vinculin competition with
and displacement of RIAM or lamellipodin(Lpd), members of the MRL family, from binding sites
on talin's rod domain. Furthermore, we developed methods to image the complex of MRL proteins
with integrins and talin (MIT complex) and showed that it formed the tips of “sticky fingers,” cellular
protrusions that sense the density of matrix proteins and physical state of the substrate during
mesenchymal cell migration. mesenchymal cell migration. We hypothesize that the MIT
complex represents one among many distinct modules that contribute to the overall
structure and function of integrin- based adhesions. This suggests the paradigm that the
integrin adhesome can be analyzed as a dynamic assembly of these modules, which form prior to
entry into the adhesions. This concept has enabled us to propose a new approach to studying
adhesions by developing methods to purify each module formed prior to integrin ligation. To test
this paradigm, we propose to purify 4 such modules and to characterize each for a) the presence
of talin-activated integrins b) characterize its protein composition. c) establish its biochemical
topology and regulation d) visualize it in living cells and e) evaluate its functions The proposed
experiments will generate foundational data for the adhesion field in three ways: a) the integrin
adhesome will be re- interpreted as a compendium of modular components; each with its own
specific composition. b) The functional studies will identify new regulators of blood and vascular
cell adhesion and signaling that may be exploitable as therapeutic targets c) A complete definition
of the protein composition of each module will serve as a public resource for the analysis of
integrin-based adhesions and will be hypothesis-generating for future studies to understand the
regulation of assembly of each module and its functional outputs."

Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading
cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with
clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and
a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and
communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community
health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors
influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW
care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW
care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and
scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to
reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial
intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and
encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions.
Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with
HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability,
feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day
readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social
supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by
performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally-
enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial.
Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled
CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The
candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical
outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop
interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen
by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with
cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This
proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by
assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in
reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement."

Emotional abuse (EA) during childhood and adolescence is associated with greater risk and severity of
depression. EA is particularly common among sexual minority youth (SMY; individuals with same sex romantic
identities and attractions), a population that experiences striking depression disparities. Critical knowledge gaps
prevent adequate detection and treatment of depression in SMY and addressing these disparities requires
rigorous research on the mechanisms underlying depression in SMY. The proposed K23 tests an innovative
model integrating cognitive and social theories of depression with affective neuroscience to explore how EA
impacts neural systems underlying in the low self-worth and a negative self-focus characteristic of depression.
This study will use task-based functional and diffusion MRI to examine the impact of EA on reward processing
neural systems (Aim 1) and self-biased processing neural systems (Aim 2), and the relationship of EA-associated
changes in these systems to depression (Aim 3) in SMY. Exploratory aims will test the extent to which EA-
associated changes in these neural systems, both independently and in combination, influence depression and
comorbid symptoms. This research supports a critical public health need by adding to emerging biological
models of depression for SMY, and will enhance understanding of how EA, a pernicious form of trauma linked
to depression severity and persistence, impacts neural systems underlying depression. Such research is a first
step towards identifying novel targets for detection and developing interventions to reduce depression following
EA, including in SMY. The proposed will be the first in a program of research examining the influence of trauma
on the adolescent brain, and understanding how trauma-associated changes relate to affective symptoms, with
a focus on minority populations. To achieve this goal, the candidate will build on their expertise in SMY mental
health and basic neuroimaging to receive training in the impact of trauma on developmental psychopathology,
state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods, and advanced biostatistics. She has an ideal mentorship team and
optimal scientific environment to provide the training necessary for her to meet her career goals. Dr. Mary Phillips
is an expert in neural systems underlying mood disorders in adolescence and young adults; Dr. Erika Forbes is
an expert in developmental psychopathology and the affective neuroscience of depression, which she has
adapted to SMY; and Dr. Judith Cohen is an expert in the impact and clinical implications of trauma on youth
mental health. Additional mentorship from consultants will provide training in the impact of trauma on the brain
in youth (Dr. Ryan Herringa), state-of-the-art fMRI (Dr. Ted Satterthwaite) and dMRI (Dr. Amelia Versace)
methods, and biostatistics (Dr. Dana Tudorascu). This training will prepare the candidate for a research career
applying psychiatry’s understanding of neural systems, and the state-of-the-art methods available to explore
them, towards addressing emerging mental health disparities in youth communities disproportionately affected
by trauma, such as SMY."

bioenergetics in order to improve outcomes for veterans with acute brain injuries and other neurological diseases.
The mechanisms linking cellular bioenergetics and cell death in ischemic brain diseases such as stroke are
incompletely understood, and a greater understanding of these details will lead to the development of urgently
needed neuroprotective agents for Veterans. During the Career Development Award-2 period, Dr. Singhal's goal is
to acquire the training and implement the studies needed to understand and develop novel treatment strategies for
conditions he treats in the Neurointensive care unit such as stroke. As such, he proposes a training program
focused on identifying the mechanisms underlying the dramatic ischemia tolerance observed in one of nature's most
resilient animals, the Arctic ground squirrel. Through comparative genomics and cell resilience-based cDNA
expression screens, he discovered unique amino acid substitutions in cytoprotective proteins conferring increased
resilience to metabolic stressors. The research proposed will build on his preliminary data and bring two candidate
genes forward for rigorous study in neural cells using metabolic and cell death assays, visualization techniques, and
biochemical measurements. He will use CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in technology to precisely edit the genes of interest,
which are not fully characterized to date, and study the effect of their editing on neuronal cell resilience (Aim 1) and
elucidate their cell physiologic mechanisms of action (Aim 2). Finally, he will test the candidate genes in the
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model in vivo (Aim 3). The in-depth characterization using in vivo
and in vitro models will establish a critical connection between the Arctic ground squirrel cytoprotective proteins and
neuroprotective mechanisms, and importantly, provide valuable insights into novel drug targets. Dr. Singhal has
assembled a diverse mentorship team comprised of experts in the fields of stroke, genetics, statistics, and
mitochondrial physiology. Dr. Singhal's career development plan includes a clear timeline for individual tutorials with
mentors and scientific advisors, hand-on experience, formal seminars, dissemination of findings, and plans for
independent projects and funding. The mentored research and training in gene editing, neurovascular biology,
mitochondrial physiology, and statistics described in this proposal will complement Dr. Singhal's training and
facilitate his goal of launching an independent research career at the VA."
10768606,"Dysfunctional breathing is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after cervical SCI (cSCI). The ability to
restore breathing in the chronic phase after cervical SCI (cSCI) is an overwhelming yet important goal. The
diaphragm, the major inspiratory muscle, is innervated by phrenic motoneurons (PMNs) located in the cervical
spinal cord (C3-C5). Cervical interneurons synapse onto PMNs and discharge in synchrony with phrenic inspir-
atory output and modulate breathing. Premotor neurons within the rostral ventral respiratory group of neurons
(rVRG) in the brainstem provide the main inspiratory drive to the spinal respiratory circuitry. Cervical spinal cord
injury (SCI) disrupts the communication between rVRG and the spinal respiratory circuitry resulting in significant
respiratory compromise. We recently demonstrated that pharmacogenetic stimulation of cervical excitatory in-
terneurons (eINs) immediately after cSCI rescues breathing in mice; however, it is not known if this strategy will
be effective in improving breathing in the chronic phase of cSCI. At the chronic stage, the respiratory network is
known to undergo significant modifications. Moreover, our previous work in non-traumatic compressive injury to
the cervical spinal cord demonstrated that cervical eINs play an integral role in promoting plasticity and main-
taining ventilation despite a significant loss of PMNs. Given that cervical eINs integrate into the respiratory net-
work, and they are necessary for the spontaneous respiratory recovery, they emerge as critical therapeutic tar-
gets for respiratory recovery in the chronic phase after traumatic cSCI. We hypothesize that providing selec-
tive excitatory input to surviving PMNs at the late stage of cSCI will enhance PMNs output and respiratory
recovery. The first objective of this proposal aims to gain more significant insights into the status of the respira-
tory neural network after chronic cSCI. The second objective of this proposal will examine a novel treatment
strategy involving selective stimulation of cervical eINs to promote respiratory recovery in the chronic phase after
cSCI.
In aim 1, we will assess the survival of PMNs following C2 hemisection injury (C2Hx) using the monosynaptic
retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin Subunit B to specifically track the PMNs. In the second part of Aim 1, we will
simultaneously map the input-output connectivity of the cervical respiratory elements, the PMNs and the
prephrenic cervical eINs, in the naïve-uninjured state and after cSCI. In Aim 2, we will selectively stimulate the
cervical eINs in the region of the phrenic nuclei after chronic cSCI using the DREADD technology. This technique
has innovative applications due to its ability to activate or silence neuronal populations non-invasively. The effect
of stimulating cervical eINs on promoting respiratory recovery after chronic cSCI will be assessed using electro-
myography and whole-body plethysmography. The expected outcomes of the proposed experiments are inno-
vative as it will increase our knowledge of the spinal respiratory network after chronic cSCI and facilitate the
development of a novel strategy to restore breathing in the chronic phase of cSCI. These results will have a
meaningful positive impact on the health and survival of veterans with SCI, and the strategy examined here has
the potential to be implemented for weaning patients off mechanical ventilation in the chronic phase after cSCI
when promoting recovery has remained a daunting task. Additionally, SCI represents a significant focus area of
the veterans, about 7% of those living with SCI in the United States have sustained their SCI while actively
serving. Injuries are often due to penetrating injuries such as from gunshots or high-powered explosive devices.
As such, military personnel with SCI face even more long-term disabilities than those endured by civilians with
SCI, and the issues more pronounced in veterans with cSCI and respiratory dysfunctions."
10768625,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite the remarkable success of the combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) to control HIV-1 infection, viral
reservoirs persist indefinitely under treatment. These persisting viral populations constitute the principal burden
for an effective HIV-1 cure, as they lead to a rapid rebound in viremia when treatment fails or after analytic
treatment interruption (ATI). Although persisting viral populations in tissue comprise most of the reservoir, the
majority of the reservoir studies do not include tissue samples due to the difficulties to obtain tissue samples
containing active foci of replication, the site of the rebounding virus. Therefore, we are not able to properly study
these viral populations and their main characteristics remain unknown. Understanding the nature and properties
of rebound should bring us a step closer to identifying the reservoir associated with persistence and rapid
rebound after ATI. Our previous studies defining the early foci of rebound after ATI revealed an unexpected
result as all detected SIV infected cells has a myeloid morphology and stained negative for CD3 and other T cell
markers. Those studies were focused on the early reservoir, established when cART is initiated 4 days post
challenge. Under these conditions, there are no virus specific cell mediated or humoral immune responses.
However, at his point is clear that rebounding virus populations are filtered by immune responses in play when
cART was initiated. Based on critical consideration and better model infection in humans, this project will
determine the impact of innate and adaptive immune pressure impacts the milieu of the emerging foci in tissues
leveraging our PET/CT guided necropsy and resection surgery workflow allowing the study of viral rebound
within tissue during the eclipse phase. We intend to use our ability to localize SIV active viremia sites in infected
macaques, to perform a detailed identification of the cells and anatomical compartments that support rebound
of persistent SIV. We will study the effect of the innate and adaptive immune system and disrupt myeloid cell
populations to determine the impact on the kinetics, magnitude, and viral population dynamics during rebound.
The proposed project is scientifically relevant in its innovative approach and methodologies as it will allow to
determine the main properties and dynamics the eclipse phase of rebound of persistent viral population after
ATI. Given the importance of persistent viral populations in rebound. A better understanding of rebound virus
population dynamics after ATI is key to developing successful strategies to cure HIV-1."

African Americans (AAs) have disproportionately higher rates and earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD) relative to White Americans. Although prior research has made significant
contributions to our understanding of racial disparities in ADRD, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of
how the individual lived experience of being AA, including cumulative exposure to structural racism, contributes
to elevated ADRD risk and the potential mechanisms underlying those risks. Building on the existing,
community-based research infrastructure developed by our team’s previously funded studies, we will follow a
cohort of residents (n=1133) living in two historically disinvested, predominantly AA communities to understand
how dynamic neighborhood socioeconomic conditions across the lifecourse contribute to cognitive outcomes in
mid- and late-life adults. This proposal rests on the premise that neighborhood segregation and subsequent
disinvestment contributes to poor cognitive outcomes for AAs via factors including a) lower access to
educational opportunities and b) higher exposure to race- and socioeconomically-relevant stressors, including
discrimination, trauma, and adverse childhood events. In turn, these cumulative exposures foster psychological
vigilance in residents, leading to cardiometabolic dysregulation and sleep disruption, which may mediate
associations between neighborhood disadvantage and ADRD risk. We also will examine potential protective
factors that may promote cognitive health, including neighborhood social cohesion, safety, and satisfaction.
The proposed study will leverage our existing longitudinal data on risk and protective factors, biobehavioral
mediators, and baseline cognitive assessments, and will include: 1) three waves of cognitive assessments in
the full cohort of participants who are 50 years+ (participants who are aged 35-49 years will have two
assessments) and clinical adjudication of ADRD in participants who are 50+ (n=906), 2) additional
assessments of blood pressure and objective sleep, 3) a comprehensive assessment of life and residential
history using the questionnaire from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); and 4) in-depth qualitative
interviews to reveal lifecourse opportunities and barriers experienced by AAs in achieving optimal cognitive
health in late life. Understanding how structural racism has influenced the lived experience of AAs including
dynamic changes in neighborhood conditions over time is critical to inform multi-level intervention and policy
efforts to reduce pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in ADRD."
10768757,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Our proposal investigates in the nonhuman primate (NHP) how muscarinic modulation enhances cognition,
motivation and behavioral regulation and which neurochemical and cell-type specific mechanisms underlie these
positive effects. We specifically will benchmark a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) for the centrally expressed
muscarinic M1 receptor, developed at the Vanderbilt Center for Drug Discovery. M1-PAMs promise to overcome
dose-limiting side effects and avoid agonist overstimulation that limit compliance, efficacy, and tolerability of
existing compounds. M1 selective modulation can be antipsychotic, reduce negative symptoms (e.g. reduce lack
of motivation) and ameliorate cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. M1-PAMs may achieve this by
gating intrinsic cholinergic signaling which is believed to regulate glutamatergic and dopaminergic release in the
prefrontal cortex and striatum. We test these hypothesized working mechanisms by determining the
neurochemical and electrophysiological consequences of M1 PAM action.
First, we will determine the dose-response efficacy of M1 PAMs to enhance cognition, motivation, and behavioral
regulation, comparing their effects to the agonist Xanomeline and the non-selective cholinergic drug Donepezil.
We will assess primary cognitive functions (attention, working memory), primary motivational functions (effort
control, resilience to loss), cognitive flexibility (set shifting, perseveration, reward learning), visuospatial problem
solving, and the regulation of behavior video-captured when NHPs engage with the touchscreen assessment
Kiosk in their home cages. The behavioral metrics evaluate five RDoC domains, tested in single sessions using
a novel Multi-Task Test Battery for NHP. We will determine dose-response efficacy for each RDoC domain
separately which clarifies how broad M1 PAMs enhance cognitive-motivational-behavioral functions and which
domains suffer from dose-limiting side effects with a conventional agonist and a nonselective cholinergic drug.
Second, we will determine the drug-dose dependent changes of extracellular concentrations of Acetylcholine,
Dopamine, Serotonin, Glutamate, GABA, and of the systemically administered drug itself. We achieve this in
NHPs in parallel in three brain areas that load differently on the five RDoC domains to determine the dose-
response efficacy for each brain area separately. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is assessed to understand
how M1 PAMs regulate glutamate and acetylcholine implicated to support cognitive RDoC constructs. The
Striatum is assessed to understand how M1 PAMs regulate dopamine to support reward learning and cognitive
flexibility. The anterior cingulate cortex is assessed to determine dose-efficacy for modulating serotonin and
glutamate to mediate effort-control and motivation. Simultaneously, neural spiking activity is recorded to
understand how M1 PAMs alter firing and synchronization of different interneuron types that we distinguish
electrophysiologically. Together, the proposed studies elucidate the working mechanisms and strength of M1
PAMs relative to existing dose-limited drug regime and thereby inform treatment strategies for schizophrenia."

Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a ubiquitous environmental exposure that has been consistently linked to
adverse neurodevelopmental effects in animal and human studies. However, definitive mechanism(s) for these
effects is currently unknown, limiting our biological understanding and delaying interventional and therapeutic
efforts to protect children from this widespread exposure. The placenta oversees prenatal neurodevelopment
through regulation of fetal growth and its neuroendocrine functions and has been consistently indicated as a
primary mediator of the effects of TRAP on the developing brain. Post-transcriptional modifications of RNA,
i.e., the epitranscriptome, are both environmentally sensitive and critical to placental development and
functions, hence providing a yet unexplored avenue to identify new mechanisms of TRAP neurotoxicity. N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA (mRNA) and a
regulator of mRNA splicing, stability, and translation. The m6A reader, writer, and eraser (RWE) proteins that
interpret, add, and remove m6A marks from mRNA are also highly sensitive to toxicants. Our team recently
showed that TRAP reaches the human placenta, thereby indicating that local TRAP accumulation may directly
alter the placental epitranscriptome and function. However, no research to date has investigated the
relationships between placental exposure to TRAP and m6A epitranscriptomics, nor has any previous study
investigated TRAP-induced m6A epitranscriptomic alterations in relation to future child neurodevelopment.
We hypothesize that placental TRAP load adversely impacts cognition via changes in the placental
m6A epitranscriptome. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a coordinated series of human and in vitro
studies. For the human studies, we will leverage two cohorts within the NYC-based Columbia Center for
-Hermanos cohorts, as discovery and replication
sets. In Aim 1, we will identify m6A epitranscriptome alterations in human placenta associated with prenatal
TRAP. We will use an innovative method to quantify BC directly on the placenta and ambient air pollution
assessment throughout pregnancy. We will use m6A-sequencing to profile placental m6A and measure protein
and mRNA expression of 18 placental m6A RWEs. We will use data-driven approaches to identify biological
pathways implicated in TRAP-related placental dysfunction. In Aim 2, we will identify m6A epitranscriptome
alterations in human placenta associated with child cognition at ages 5-6 measured through a battery of gold-
standard neuropsychological tests. In Aim 3, we will conduct in vitro studies of trophoblasts to identify TRAP-
induced alterations of the m6A epitranscriptome and their impact on mRNA stability, splicing, and translation.
Together, these aims will uncover the impacts of TRAP on the placental epitranscriptome and the ensuing
effects on child neurodevelopment. This research will lead to novel insight into the mechanisms linking the
prenatal environment to child neurodevelopment."

Glioblastoma is the most common cancer originating in the brain with ~12,000 new diagnoses
per year in the U.S.A. and median survival about 18 months. A common dilemma for the patient
and treatment team is that the clinical MRI one month after radiation therapy (RT) shows
growth of unclear significance in up to 50% of patients. Patients with true progression (TP) of
non-responding tumor continue to progress on serial MRIs and usually die within 9 months. TP
is usually determined 6 or more months after completion of RT, often when it is too late to
intervene. The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to improve survival of patients with
cancer. Our goal, and an unmet need, is to identify glioblastoma patients with TP early during
treatment and implement aggressive second-line therapy to improve survival.
This proposal describes an innovative approach to identify early glioblastoma TP by improving
neuroimaging and image processing on MRIdian, a new combination MRI and RT (MRI-RT)
device from ViewRay, Inc where patients undergo MRI daily as part of their RT. Our preliminary
data with MRIdian is the first to demonstrate daily glioblastoma growth on MRI in patients
during RT. By developing physiologic MRI techniques on MRIdian (Aim 1), we seek to identify
TP when there is growth during RT (Aim 2), and intensify RT to that TP (Aim 3/future).
The most sensitive and specific commonly applied clinical MRI techniques for identifying TP
after RT correlate with tumor physiology: diffusion (cellularity), perfusion (hypoxia), and
spectroscopy (metabolism). These are collectively termed mpMRI. The hypothesis of aim 1 is
that the academic-industrial partnership between Miami and ViewRay can develop mpMRI for
daily measurements during RT on MRIdian. The hypothesis of aim 2 is that the images from
daily mpMRI during MRI-RT in glioblastoma patients can be processed by machine learning
and radiomics techniques to automatically detect glioblastoma growth and predict long-term
outcome. Aim 3 then combines aims 1-2 to test a prospective workflow to intensify RT to TP
when TP is first identified during RT based on mpMRI elucidated trends in tumor physiology, so
called “physiologic adaptive RT” (PART).
The PART workflow will be developed by Miami and Viewray and integrated into MRIdian. The
advantage of using single platform MRIdian is that the PART workflow will be distributed by
Viewray to the over 60 MRIdian centers. This easy clinical translation will permit us to proceed
with multi-institutional trials of early RT dose escalation to improve survival of poorly
responding glioblastomas."
10844558,"SUMMARY
 Phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase (PAP) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that plays a key role in lipid
homeostasis by controlling the cellular levels of its substrate, PA, and its product, diacylglycerol. These lipids are
essential intermediates for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and membrane phospholipids; they also function in
phospholipid synthesis gene expression, lipid droplet formation, and vesicular trafficking. The importance of PAP
to lipid homeostasis and cell physiology is exemplified in yeast, mouse, and human by a host of cellular defects
and lipid-based diseases associated with loss or overexpression of enzyme function. In yeast, loss of Pah1 PAP
results in a massive expansion of the nuclear/ER membrane; this is ascribed to increases in PA content and
phospholipid synthesis that occur at the expense of triacylglycerol synthesis. The increase in phospholipid
synthesis is associated with the derepression of phospholipid synthesis gene expression, whereas the reduction
in the synthesis of triacylglycerol is associated with a decrease in lipid droplet formation. Lipin PAP deficiency
in mouse and human causes rhabdomyolysis, and deficiency in the mouse is also characterized by hepatic
steatosis during the neonatal period, lipodystrophy, insulin resistance and peripheral neuropathy. The
overexpression of lipin 1 PAP in mouse results in increased lipogenesis and obesity. Human lipin 2 PAP
deficiency causes chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, whereas
genetic variations in the human LPIN2 PAP gene are associated with type 2 diabetes. PAP is a peripheral
membrane protein that must translocate from the cytosol to the nuclear/ER membrane in order to convert PA to
diacylglycerol. This conserved process is governed by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the enzyme. In
the cytosol, PAP is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases that causes its retention in this cellular
compartment. The membrane association of PAP requires is dephosphorylation by a conserved protein
phosphatase complex (e.g., Nem1-Spo7 in yeast, CTDNEP1-NEP1-R1 in mouse and human). Besides its
location, the phosphorylation of PAP inhibits its activity but stabilizes it to proteasomal degradation;
dephosphorylation has the opposite effects. The work proposed in this MIRA application, which builds on our
prior work made possible by the advantages of the yeast model, will gain understanding into the structure-
function, mode of action and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-mediated regulations of Pah1 PAP and the
Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase complex. We will pursue rigorous experimental approaches that combine
biochemistry and molecular genetics to shed light on how the proportional synthesis of triacylglycerol and
membrane phospholipids is controlled. Based on the conserved nature of the Nem1-Spo7/Pah1 phosphatase
cascade, the information gained from our studies with yeast is expected to be relevant in human."
10780529,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of the Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling is to achieve comprehensive predictive
models of biological systems, such as whole-cell models, that can guide precision medicine and synthetic
biology. In the previous cycle, we focused on model reproducibility. This culminated in the release of the
reproducibility portal, biosimulators.org. This was the result of working with over 80 collaborators around the
world.
For cycle 2, we plan to switch from model reproducibility to model credibility and more formal technologies that
deal with model decomposition and composition. Given the recent experience with the perception of poor
credibility of COVID models, developing technologies to help create and measure model credibility is critical
and above all timely to the biomedical community. Moreover, if biomedical models are ever to reach the clinic
and make a substantial impact, model credibility will be of utmost importance. No clinician will use a predictive
model without some degree of evidence and trust to substantiate the claims of a model's capabilities. Moreover,
for models of national importance that can affect policy decisions affecting millions of people, the ability to
automatically assess credibility of a model would seem paramount.
To achieve our goals, the three technology and research cores will focus on: (1) Credibility infrastructure,
credibility assessment metrics and model management and decomposition; (2) automated annotations, and
continuing to curate models for the reproducibility portal; (3) Implementing model composition for building
larger multiscale models that will exploit our multi-paradigm simulator farm underlying the reproducibility
portal.
We will buttress this technology through collaboration with an extremely wide range of collaborators and
service projects. Through our outreach and dissemination efforts we will make sure we inform, train and
encourage the community to move towards more systematic models approaches. Specifically. we will (1)
promote the importance of credible modeling by organizing meetings and publishing perspectives; (2) train
researchers to conduct modeling reproducibly and credible by organizing workshops and publishing tutorials;
and (3) help researchers and journals build, annotate, simulate, analyze, and verify models; (3) Host small
online competitions to encourage younger scientists to take on the baton and peruse more systematic model
development and testing.
The center was one of the first and still the only large-scale effort to make biomedical modeling reproducible.
With the proposed cycle 2 effort, the center will be the first large-scale effort to also work on biomodel
credibility. We anticipate that this unique center will accelerate the development of comprehensive predictive
models by enhancing the understandability, reusability, reproducibility, and credibility of biomedical modeling."
10844559,"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most significant causes of neurodevelopmental
problems in American children, with high rates of death and major disability. The understanding of the
impacts of glucose in these newborns has been limited to date by intermittent testing. The NOGIN
study (Neurological Outcome of Glycemia in Neonatal Encephalopathy), using continuous glucose
monitoring, has demonstrated that hyperglycemia occurs in more than 50% of HIE. While
hypoglycemia was expected to be associated with brain injury, the surprising discovery has been that
hyperglycemia, and not hypoglycemia, is associated with worse immediate brain function, brain injury
on MRI, and motor and cognitive function at 18-month follow-up, despite adjusting for HIE severity.
Standardized questionnaires also suggest increased risk for behavioural diagnoses. With the high
incidence of hyperglycemia in neonatal encephalopathy and the strong evidence suggesting major
additive impacts on long- term outcomes, it is now critical to clarify (1) how the findings of posterior-
predominant brain injury translate to difficulties in cortical visual processing and (2) how the early
findings of cognitive and behavioural concerns translate to later diagnoses by early school age.
The overall objective for this study is to determine how hyperglycemia, in the context of neonatal
encephalopathy, independently predicts outcomes by early school age. The specific aims include:
1. Assess how hypo- and hyperglycemia in neonatal encephalopathy impact cortical visual processing
by early school age.
2. Assess how hypo- and hyperglycemia in neonatal encephalopathy impact cognitive, language,
social, and behavioral function by early school age.
The NOGIN study, a prospective cohort study originally aiming to determine what degree of low
glucose results in hypoglycemic brain injury, with enrolment to complete in the next few months. The
first subject turns 5 years old in September 2019. To achieve the current research objectives, children
will be asked to return at 5 years of age for neuropsychological assessment (including WPPSI-IV,
NEPSY-II, MCHAT, CBCL) and magnetoencephalography (vision tasks, resting brain network
circuitry) to understand how specific levels of hyperglycemia translate to ongoing long-term deficits.
By correlating specific levels of hyperglycemia in HIE in neonates with the degree of
neurodevelopmental impairment, this study will help to target the management and control of
hyperglycemia to decrease brain injury and improve outcomes for these newborns. The data
generated will also help with early identification of newborns at greatest risk for adverse outcomes,
enabling more targeted early adjunctive therapies to improve outcomes after HIE."
10844563,"Childhood obesity represents a major public health challenge. Growing evidence supports an 
important role for intrauterine conditions in shaping susceptibility for obesity (the fetal 
origins concept). However, many key questions remain regarding determinants, outcomes and 
underlying mechanisms. First, although maternal metabolic and stress hormones have separately been 
identified as key biological effectors of fetal programming, their interaction has not yet been 
examined in this context. Second, although it’s well established that it is not BMI, per se, 
but excess fat mass and its relative distribution (intra-abdominal, hepatic) that underlies the 
detrimental effects of obesity, it is not yet known whether fetal programming influences the 
distribution of adipose tissue mass. Third, although mitochondrial function-the central 
modulator of cellular energy production, storage and use-has been identified as a key mediator of 
the effects of insulin- resistance (IR) and stress/cortisol on the development and pathogenesis 
of obesity, its role as a putative mechanism in fetal programming has yet to be 
determined. Dr. Lauren Gyllenhammer’s K99/R00 proposal addresses these 3 knowledge 
gaps using complementary designs (observational and experimental), state-of-the-art 
methods (Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) imaging), and 
multiple levels of analysis (cells to in vivo physiology), to test the hypothesis that maternal 
prenatal stress/cortisol potentiates the unfavorable effects of gestational IR on offspring adipose 
tissue mass/distribution, mediated by offspring mitochondrial function. In the K99 mentored phase, 
Dr. Gyllenhammer will leverage and add measures to an ongoing NIH-funded prenatal observational 
cohort, with existing maternal prenatal cortisol and fasting metabolic measures and offspring 
serial % fat mass measures (DXA from birth to 5yrs) in N=100 mother/child dyads. She will 
add novel measures of MR-based adipose tissue distribution and mitochondrial 
function in the 5 yr old children, and examine the statistical interaction between maternal 
cortisol and fasting markers of IR on these outcomes. She will advance her knowledge of fetal 
programming, gestational/developmental biology, and obtain advanced bench and analysis 
techniques relevant for DOHaD research (cellular biology/mitochondria bench training, 
bioinformatics analysis methods, cutting-edge MRI methods in newborns and young 
children) through investigation of these aims, extensive hands-on training, conferences, 
didactic instruction, and guidance from a diverse advisory committee of respected researchers. In 
the R00 phase, she will enroll a new, independent cohort of N=80 pregnant women and use an 
experimental cross-over study design to quantify the physiological interaction of prenatal stress 
and IR to prospectively predict newborn mitochondrial function and adipose mass and distribution 
trajectory from birth till 6 mo age. By utilizing training from the K99 phase, she will explore 
novel cellular mechanisms of prenatal programming, and uncover relationships between 
maternal prenatal psychological and metabolic stress on offspring adiposity development. 
Findings from these complementary studies will improve the understanding of early risk factors for 
child- hood obesity, potentially provide cellular and behavioral interventional targets for 
 prevention and treatment, and will further Dr. Gyllenhammer’s career goal to develop and establish 
herself as an independent investigator."

Aim of this program, currently in its twenty fourth year of funding, is to provide formal training in either
clinical, laboratory or biomedical engineering research to this select group of surgical residents as an
integral component of their postgraduate clinical training. One trainee per year is competitively selected
from those in the general surgery training program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as well as accomplished
surgical residents from other institutions. In this renewal, we have significantly modified the research training
plan in direct response to the needs of our trainees. Trainees will enter one of three tracks: Basic/Translational,
Clinical and a newly added Biomedical Engineering and Device Design Track. Each trainee will be guided to
choose a senior preceptor/mentor from our list of participating faculty, all of whom have demonstrated an
outstanding record of achievement, significant NIH funding, and an established record of mentorship. The
formal scientific training period begins after the third clinical year, and lasts for two or three consecutive years.
Many of the T32 trainees complete Masters or Doctoral degrees in the JHU Bloomberg School of Public
Health. All trainees are assigned an Individual Progress Committee charged with critiquing the trainee's
research, monitoring long-term progress towards an independent investigative career, and aiding in the
selection of appropriate course work. Additional oversight and guidance is provided by both Internal and
External Advisory Boards. This T32 training includes formal training in research ethics and mandatory course
work directly relevant to the research topics. All our trainees are immersed in an outstanding educational
environment, which includes the McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine, the NIDDK-funded
Johns Hopkins Digestive Diseases Research Core Center, and the NCI funded Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive

10844905,"Summary
Acute ischemic injury, such as myocardial infarction (MI), is a major contributor toward the development of heart
failure (HF), a progressive disease affecting millions of patients and costing billions of dollars annually. Myeloid
cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, are rapidly recruited to (peripheral blood leukocytes,
PBL) or activated within (tissue resident macrophages, TRM) the heart following acute injury or stress where
they regulate a wide variety of cardiac remodeling responses. Additionally, macrophages secrete numerous
paracrine factors to influence their surroundings such as extracellular vesicles (EVs), which includes small 40-
150 nm EVs termed exosomes. We previously demonstrated that the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is a critical
regulator of immune cell responsiveness to cardiac injury, but with limited mechanistic insight, particularly with
respect to myeloid cells, including macrophages. We have thus focused on defining the impact of β2AR deletion
specifically in myeloid cells on cardiac function and remodeling following injury. We have developed a mouse
model with myeloid cell-specific constitutive β2AR deletion (LysM-Cre/β2ARf/f; LB2), which exhibit less
maladaptive remodeling following MI, including reduced expansion of dead cardiomyocytes and increased
neutrophil clearance, resulting in preservation of cardiac function and reduced fibrotic remodeling. Various
myeloid cells isolated from LB2 mice, and PBL from human HF patients chronically taking β-blockers, were found
to express higher levels of genes involved in the regulation efferocytosis/phagocytosis, which are known to
functionally enhance apoptotic cell clearance and promote cardiac repair. Additionally, exosomes isolated from
β2AR-defcient BMDMs contain less inflammatory and more pro-angiogenic factors and induced greater
endothelial cell capillary tube formation in vitro. When injected intramyocardially at the time of MI in wild-type
mice, β2AR-deficient BMDM-derived exosomes stabilized cardiac function as compared to PBS- or WT
exosome-injected mice, which was associated with decreased fibrosis and improved capillary density. Overall,
we hypothesize that β2AR deletion results in alterations within myeloid cells, including macrophages and their
exosomes, that promote beneficial cardiac remodeling responses following injury. In Aim 1 we will determine
the mechanisms by which myeloid cell-specific β2AR deletion enhances cardiac repair following injury, with a
focus on efferocytosis and cardiac TRM. In Aim 2 we will investigate whether clinically used β-blockers induce
comparative alterations in both PBL and cardiac TRM and if these changes are observed in the PBL of human
HF patients. In Aim 3 we will characterize the properties of β2AR-deficient macrophage-derived exosomes that
promote angiogenesis and stabilize cardiac remodeling. Overall, the goal of this project is to define how myeloid
cell-expressed β2AR regulates cardiac function and remodeling after injury, attain a fundamental understanding
of the mechanisms by which macrophage-derived exosomes contribute to these processes and determine
whether β2AR-selective therapeutics can regulate their contents and impact on injury."
10778563,"Deciphering the Molecular Orchestrators of Heterochromatin-Lamina Interactions at the Nuclear
Periphery. Ashley M Karnay
Abstract
It is well established that the eukaryotic genome is segregated within three dimensional nuclear space, with
specific genomic regions adopting subnuclear positions relative to specific nuclear landmarks. One such nuclear
landmark associated is the nuclear lamina (NL) at the nuclear periphery. Positioning of specific genes at the NL
correlates with enrichment in heterochromatin-associated epigenetic signatures, such as dimethylation of Lysine
9 on Histone H3 (H3K9me2), and repression of gene transcription. The dynamic coupling of peripheral
positioning and gene silencing plays a key role in directing crucial developmental processes such as
cardiomyocyte lineage restriction and goes awry in genetic forms of cardiomyopathy and other diseases.
Genomic regions that make contact with the NL are defined as lamina-associated domains (LADs). Distributed
across all chromosomes, these large domains dynamically interact with the NL to release or attach genes and
regulatory elements in accordance with cell-type and differentiation state-specific gene expression programs.
Specifically, loss of LADs results in precocious cardiac differentiation. How chromatin-lamina interactions are
established and maintained remains poorly understood. Endogenously-encoded sequences sufficient for
peripheral targeting of LADs have not been identified, strongly supporting the existence of regulatory proteins,
epigenetic modifications or biomolecular processes capable of mediating chromatin-NL contacts. However, the
precise orchestrators of spatial and temporal dynamics between LADs and the nuclear periphery remain elusive.
By combining targeted manipulations of local transcriptional states and epigenetic signatures with single-cell
microscopy and population-based genomics analysis I will test the hypothesis that the heterochromatin-
associated epigenetic mark H3K9me2 is required to maintain sequestered genomic loci at the nuclear
periphery while transcriptional repression serves to establish chromatin-lamina interactions. These
studies will provide mechanistic insights into how chromatin states and gene activity are coupled to gene radial
positioning. By probing peripheral chromatin organizational principles at the single-cell level while simultaneously
analyzing higher-order genome organization at the population level, I can uniquely dissect the underlying
mechanism mediating the spatial organization of the genome. Elucidating the link between nuclear organization,
human development and disease etiology is crucial to understanding how these relationships impact
organogenesis and disease."
10778567,"Advanced Imaging Tools to Assess Cancer Therapeutics in Pediatric Patients
Imaging tests are essential for cancer diagnoses in children. However, computed tomography (CT) and
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT are associated with considerable radiation exposure. Several large
population studies have demonstrated that cumulative radiation doses from CT scans significantly increase the
risk of children developing leukemia, thyroid cancer, and brain cancer later in life. Thus, there is an urgent
need to reduce the radiation exposure of children caused by medical imaging procedures. To this end, we
have developed a radiation-free imaging test for pediatric tumor staging, based on advanced whole body
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DW MRI) technology. Our team was the first to integrate
tumor physiology information (proton diffusion) with an MRI technique for anatomical orientation (nanoparticle-
enhanced T1-weighted MRI), based on the concept of integrated PET/CT scans (Lancet Oncology). While DW
MRI has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection, the value of DW MRI for cancer
therapy monitoring in children has not yet been extensively studied. Current approaches for assessing tumor
therapy responses in children often measure changes in tumor metabolism using PET after the injection of
radioactive glucose (18F-FDG). Previous comparisons of WB-DW MRI and 18F-FDG PET for cancer therapy
monitoring have been inconclusive, possibly because the scans were not obtained at the same time. Thus,
apparent differences may be due to differences in the timing of the scan. We are in a unique position to
address this problem by simultaneously measuring therapy-induced changes in tumor metabolism and
diffusion in children. These measurements have only recently become possible due to novel integrated
PET/MRI technology, which is available at our pediatric hospital. The overall goal of our project is to
compare the diagnostic value of DW MRI with that of 18F-FDG PET-based imaging tests for tumor
therapy response assessment in children with cancer. In our pursuit of an improved and immediately
clinically applicable approach for a minimally invasive imaging test, we will first apply artificial intelligence
algorithms to develop ultra-low-dose 18F-FDG PET/MR scans. Next, we will determine the value of ultra-low-
dose 18F-FDG PET and DW-MRI scans for monitoring tumor response to classical chemotherapy: We will
determine which pediatric tumor type should be monitored with 18F-FDG PET only, DW-MRI only or a
combined approach. Finally, we will determine the value of ultra-low-dose 18F-FDG PET and advanced DW-
MRI techniques for monitoring tumor response to immunotherapies. Both radiation-free WB-DW MRI and ultra-
low-dose 18F-FDG PET/MRI entail significantly less radiation exposure than traditional 18F-FDG PET/CT scans.
The results of this project will yield customized cancer therapy response assessments for children
with substantially reduced radiation exposure compared with current clinical imaging tests, thus
eliminating associated risks of secondary cancer development later in life."
10778573,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cortical inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs), which develop intricate local circuits, critically regulate higher-
order brain functions by balancing and shaping neuronal activity. Consistent with its indispensable role in
normal brain functions, malformation/malfunction of the inhibitory system is implicated in a wide array of brain
disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the wiring of IN local circuits remain largely unknown. Cortical INs comprise diverse cell types that
are defined by morphology, physiology, and gene expression. Notably, different IN subtypes also show distinct
synaptic specificity at laminar/cellular as well as subcellular levels. Although subtype-specific synaptic
connectivity is considered a critical property of INs to ensure functional diversity of the inhibitory system, the
molecular mechanisms underlying IN synaptic specificity remains poorly understood. The objective of this
proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which IN subtypes establish layer/cell type-
and subcellular domain-specific synapses. To achieve this goal, we will perform a series of experiments
using chandelier cells (ChCs), which exclusively innervate axon initial segments (AISs) of layer-specific
pyramidal neurons (PNs). The ChC is known to critically regulate PN spike generation and has been implicated
in schizophrenia and epilepsy. Besides their functional significance, the stereotypy of their synaptic
organization make ChCs an attractive model to study the molecular mechanisms for IN synaptic specificity.
Our preliminary data has shown that: (1) IgSF11 proteins that are known to bind with each other are expressed
in both ChCs and layer-specific target PNs, (2) Gldn proteins that are known to bind to AIS-enriched proteins,
NF186, are preferentially expressed in ChCs, (3) IgSF11 in ChCs plays an essential role in their presynaptic
development, (4) Gldn and NF186 appear to play a role in initiating ChC synapses, and (5) IgSF11 that is free
from the Gldn-NF186 system appears not to induce ChC synapses. Based on our findings, we propose to test
the hypothesis that the layer-specific synaptogenic action and the subcellular domain-specific recognition
mediated through IgSF11 homophilic interactions and Gldn-NF186 interactions, respectively, cooperatively
determine ChC synaptic specificity. We will pursue the following specific aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1,
we will determine the role of the IgSF11 homophilic interaction between pre- and postsynaptic neurons in
layer-specific synapse formation by ChCs. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of Gldn and NF186 in ChC
synapse formation on AISs. In Aim 3, we will determine the regulatory role of NF186/Gldn in gating IgSF11
signaling to induce ChC presynaptic boutons at AISs. Upon completion of this study, we will gain not only
important insights into molecular mechanisms for IN wiring but also a clue to developing therapeutic strategies
to functionally repair disordered/damaged brains."

10762658,"SUMMARY
Food allergy affects millions of people worldwide and the prevalence is increasing rapidly. Unfortunately,
many aspects of the mechanisms behind food allergy are poorly understood, and thus treatment options are
limited. To enhance our understanding of food allergy, the Food Allergy Science Initiative (FASI) was founded
in 2016 with the goal or understanding the mechanism of disease in food allergies and bring those insights
into therapeutics. Food allergy is traditionally thought of as a malfunction of the immune system. However, it
has become clear that the nervous system and intestinal epithelium also play an important role in allergic
disease; this Program will use an integrative approach to investigate these underlying pathways. Our team
will explore the hypothesis that food allergy is an exaggerated or mis-targeted reaction that normally aims to
protect from harmful substances present in food, including noxious phytochemicals and toxins. This is based
on growing evidence indicating that neuro–immune interactions play a fundamental role in food allergies. For
example, many manifestations of food allergies (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea) involve
combined effects of inflammatory mediators and parasympathetic reflexes. In addition, sensory inputs
through the vagal afferents and dorsal root ganglia neurons dedicated to monitoring noxious inputs appear to
be responsive to allergens detected by the immune system. Multiple reciprocal interactions between the two
systems complement each other’s capacities such that antigen-specific antibodies provide inputs to the
sensory neurons, leading to their processing in the CNS, and neuronal control circuits coordinate optimal
defense modalities of the immune system. Conversely, the nervous system has greater capacity for
evaluation of environmental cues and the internal state of the organism and can use its superior information
processing capacities to dictate the outcome of immune recognition (tolerance versus sensitization) and
immune effector functions.
Neuro–immune communications is a nascent field and the Program will address some of the foundational
questions that will illuminate the logic of these mechanisms and help uncover new targets for therapeutic
interventions. We will focus on key questions in neuro-immune interactions that are relevant for
understanding food allergy. This will include investigation of how mast cells orchestrate epithelial and
neuronal responses (Project 1), neuronal circuits engaged inin food allergy (Project 2), and mapping physical
interactions between epithelial, immune, and neuronal cells involved in development of food allergy (Project
3). All three Projects will be supported by both the Transgenic Core (Core B) and Bioinformatics Core (Core
C). The power of this Program team is that investigators with expertise in mucosal immunology, neurobiology,
and allergic inflammation are coming together to study food allergen responses, and the team is much
stronger than the sum of its individual parts. The Projects proposed here will incorporate insights and
expertise from diverse and complementary perspectives from our investigators to provide a comprehensive
assessment of how the enteric nervous system, the central nervous system, the immune system, and
intestinal epithelial cells interact to regulate the responses to food allergy."
10916443,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 40 million people and is
projected to triple by 2050. Although post-mortem examination is the gold standard for establishing AD
pathology, assessment of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or positron-emission
tomography (PET) are currently used widely as surrogates. However, imaging modalities are costly and CSF
procedure is invasive. Therefore, there is a need for highly accessible and cost-effective non-invasive diagnostic
tests for AD and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will eventually develop AD. Over the last two
decades, circulating nucleic acids have emerged as a viable source of liquid biopsy in multiple diseases. Recent
whole-transcriptome characterization studies using post-mortem human brain tissue samples have
demonstrated that the transcriptional profile of AD patients differ significantly from healthy individuals. Therefore,
circulating messenger RNA (mRNA) appear to be a promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarker source for AD.
Although quantification of cell-free mRNAs (cf-mRNAs) was once considered challenging due to their low
abundance in the circulation, we and others have developed a robust next generation sequencing (NGS) based
platform for accurate quantification of cf-mRNA. Subsequently, we have conducted preliminary cf-mRNA
profiling studies in multiple diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, liver diseases and cancers and
demonstrated its utility as a platform to develop non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of
diseases. In particular, we have recently profiled plasma cf-mRNA transcriptomes of 126 AD subjects and
compared to those of 115 age matched controls. We discovered that a substantial number of genes were
dysregulated in plasma of AD subjects and some of these genes correlated with severity of cognitive impairment
in AD subjects. These AD associated dysregulated cf-mRNA transcripts were able to robustly identify AD
subjects and demonstrated the potential of cf-mRNA as a source for non-invasive biomarker development. In
this proposal, we will first optimize and establish clinical-grade protocols to minimize potential variabilities for the
downstream cf-mRNA Seq profiling. We will then profile the cf-mRNA transcriptome of well-characterized AD
and MCI subject samples as well as other neurological diseases and build diagnostic and prognostic classifiers
for AD and MCI using comprehensive bioinformatic approaches. We will subsequently validate the performance
of these classifiers in intended-use clinical validation cohorts."

The centrosome is a membraneless organelle comprising a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar
material, which nucleates microtubules to direct cellular trafficking and mitosis. Cancer cells frequently possess
extra or aberrant centrosomes, which are associated with poor prognosis. Multiple mechanisms for centrosome
overexpansion in cancer cells are proposed, including failures in cytokinesis and unregulated centrosome
duplication. Centrosome amplification produces erroneous mitotic spindles, which lead to chromosomal
segregation defects, contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Drosophila neural stem cells
(NSCs) represent a genetically tractable model to study mechanisms by which centrosomes assure proper
mitotic potency. High grade brain cancers frequently exhibit centrosome amplifications, illustrating how the
Drosophila NSC model system informs foundational cancer cell biology. NSCs undergo repeated rounds of
asymmetric cell division along an invariant apical-basal polarity axis to regenerate a self-renewing stem cell
and a daughter cell fated for differentiation. Our lab recently discovered that loss of the RNA-binding protein
Orb2 results in centrosome amplification, dysregulation of centrosome asymmetry, and spindle alignment
errors in NSCs, but the mechanisms behind these defects remain elusive. Orb2 is a conserved cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) ortholog involved in the translational regulation of mRNAs. I
hypothesize that Orb2 represses the translation of specific centrosome and spindle-associated RNAs
to control NSC asymmetric cell division. Importantly, my preliminary data show that the basal centrosome is
hyperactivated in orb2 null NSCs. To determine the mechanism by which Orb2 influences asymmetric
centrosome maturation (Aim1), I will 1) test whether Orb2 represses the translation of the centrosome
activation targets aurA, polo, cnb, or wdr62, and 2) determine if Orb2 requires RNA-binding activity to promote
NSC centrosome asymmetry. To determine the mechanism by which Orb2 influences spindle alignment and
centrosome segregation (Aim2), I will 1) test whether Orb2 represses the translation of spindle stability targets
msps, tacc, or eb1; and 2) live image control and orb2 null NSCs to characterize the formation of dysmorphic
spindles and supernumerary centrosomes. This proposed study will reveal how centrosome and mitotic
asymmetry is guided by translational control of centrosome and spindle proteins, providing insight into how
post transcriptional regulation of the centrosome cycle can lead to cancer."

Regulation of cardiomyocyte division is required for proper heart development, and is implicated in congenital
heart disease. Neural innervation of the heart regulates heart rate, which impacts cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Furthermore, neurons release neuropeptides that are key factors in promoting cell proliferation. Recent evidence
suggests neural innervation from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (extrinsic innervation)
of the heart promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in post-natal mice. Ciona robusta are a closely related
chordate, which have documented conserved features such as neurons within the heart (intrinsic neurons).
Unlike mammalian hearts that cease proliferating shortly after birth, Ciona hearts proliferate during development
and into adulthood. The neurons associated with Ciona hearts are peptidergic, suggesting neuropeptides are
secreted from these neurons. Tachykinin is a conserved family of neuropeptides that includes Substance P,
which is implicated in cardiac disease, and is secreted from nerves that innervate the heart in vertebrates. The
function of neural innervation in Ciona is not known, however we have preliminary data indicating the
neuropeptide tachykinin promotes cardiac proliferation in the developing and adult Ciona heart. The sole article
documenting Ciona heart innervation has not been followed up, and thus we investigated if there was
unappreciated extrinsic innervation that exists in Ciona hearts. We find evidence of neurons from the brain
(extrinsic) of Ciona innervating the intrinsic neurons of the heart. We hypothesize that neuronal input promotes
proliferation in developing Ciona hearts. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data that the developing
Ciona heart is innervated by extrinsic and intrinsic neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest tachykinin signaling
promotes cardiac proliferation in developing and adult animals. Last, our preliminary single cell RNA-seq data
suggest intrinsic neurons in the heart can respond to tachykinin. We propose the following aims to investigate
our hypothesis.
Aim I: Characterize neuronal innervation of the Ciona heart. We will determine the temporal and spatial time-
course of neural innervation of the Ciona heart. We will use single cell RNA-seq to identify markers of all cell
types in the heart including those expressing the tachykinin receptor (neurokinin) and subtypes of neurons.
Aim II: Determine whether neuronal signaling regulates cardiac cell proliferation. We will identify the
developmental time-point(s) which tachykinin activates cardiomyocyte proliferation. Next we will prevent
tachykinin signaling in intrinsic neurons or cardiomyocytes to determine what cell type tachykinin acts on. We
will investigate if tachykinin promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation indirectly by testing if the growth factors
released by intrinsic neurons promote cardiomyocyte proliferation directly. My ultimate career goal is to study
the role of neural innervation on cardiac development at a primarily undergraduate institution."
10915458,"Project Summary:
Cognitive deficits including disruptions in hippocampal-dependent memory are a hallmark of aging. Predictably,
aging-associated cognitive decline is exacerbated by sleep disruptions commonly seen in the aging and elderly
population. However, there is a significant lack of understanding about the mechanism behind the
interconnected processes of sleep, aging and learning. One significant challenge to unraveling these
mechanisms has been the lack of tools to study intracellular and extracellular signals in real time with high
temporal resolution. This has made it difficult to observe the modulation of these signals alongside such
dynamic processes as sleep, learning and aging. To address these challenges, our lab developed a
fluorescence-lifetime based optical sensor, FLIM-AKAR, which when used in combination with a custom-built
fluorescence lifetime photometry (FLiP) rig has allowed us to observe the activity of cAMP-dependent protein
kinase A (PKA), an important plasticity signal that has been implicated in the formation and consolidation of
sleep-dependent learning and has been shown to enhance learning in aging mice. Paring 24-hour FLiP
recordings in hippocampal CA1 with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography
(EMG) measurements revealed a synchronized, transient activation of PKA that is associated with transitions
from sleep to wake. Due to its short duration, this signal has never been observed before in a behaving animal.
Thus, this study aims to explore its function on both cellular and behavioral levels and elucidate how those
functions may change in aging mice. Using photoactivatable adenylate cyclase (biPAC) and perforated patch
clamp, I will determine whether transient PKA activation is sufficient to cause an increase in intrinsic excitability
(IE), a known function of PKA and a known cellular correlate of learning. Further, by using biPAC and
photoactivatable protein kinase inhibitor peptide (PA-PKI) to bidirectionally manipulate this transient PKA
signal, I aim to determine whether increasing the frequency of these transients can rescue hippocampal-
dependent learning deficits in aging mice or disrupt intact hippocampal-dependent learning in adult mice.
Ultimately, our findings will provide a more nuanced understanding of how PKA functions at physiologic
timescales and in the context of aging, sleep, and learning. This study will also stand as an example of how
taking advantage of new optical tools can bolster our understanding of how the dynamics of cell signaling
relate to complex behaviors."
10892300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuroinflammation is a shared feature of obesity and dementia, but the processes that initiate and perpetuate
glial reactivity are not well understood,. Several recent studies, including from our lab, have outlined signaling
cascades linking peripheral and central inflammation in obesity in males, but vulnerability to obesity-induced
metabolic pathology is sexually dimorphic, and susceptibility to neuroinflammation follows similar patterns. Adult
females exhibit stronger innate immunity, and evidence from clinical and experimental studies suggests that this
dimorphism involves sex differences in activation of complement. However, current understanding of tissue-
specific complement activation remains rudimentary due to the scarcity of approaches for cell type-specific
manipulation. To this end, we generated transgenic mice with inducible, cell type-specific deletion of the
endogenous complement inhibitor Crry, and will use this model to distinguish between target cells and 'bystander'
populations in the adult brain. After determining whether selective activation of complement is sufficient for
neuroinflammation, we will examine the role of sexually dimorphic complement activation as a mechanism for
differential vulnerability to synaptic and behavioral dysfunction on obesogenic diets. These themes will be
addressed using state-of-the-art methodology, including newly developed strategies for high-throughput
morphometric analysis of glial cells in cleared brains and region-specific manipulation of glial gene expression."
10931729,"Abstract
Recent technological innovations have significantly increased the efficiency of cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM), causing a proliferation in the number of structures resolved with ever-increasing
resolution. As many of the ""low hanging fruit"" structures have been determined, studies have shifted
toward increasingly complex specimens, pushing the capabilities of current processing software and
requiring novel methodologies. One class of challenging molecule for cryo-EM is tubular molecules that
can have ambiguous symmetries. In particular, membrane remodeling proteins that form tubules are
often only locally ordered making them intractable for structure determination. Another challenge for
cryo-EM structure determination is the problem of the air/water interface. Often when blotting a sample
for cryo-EM preparation, the sample can interact with the air/water interface causing protein
denaturation, aggregation, or preferred orientations. We have developed a new technique that we are
calling reconstruction of average subtracted tubular regions (RASTR) that has the potential to solve
both of these problems. RASTR breaks down tubular cryo-EM samples into individual surfaces which
enables structure determination without knowing or applying helical symmetry and classification of
tubular samples that are only locally ordered with no long-range order. Here we propose two aims to
make RASTR more robust, generalizable, and higher-resolution. These aims will be driven by
challenging tubular samples that have proven to be intractable to typical cryo-EM structure
determination methods. Finally, a third aim is to extend the RASTR approach to single particles bound
to tubular substrates in order to protect them from the air/water interface and prevent preferred
orientations. Together the proposed aims give RASTR the potential to become a general platform to
enable structure determination of challenging samples."

 Project Summary/Abstract: Panic disorder (PD) is a severe anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent
panic attacks affecting about 2-5% of the population with agoraphobia present in half of PD subjects, and
results in severe disability in about a third of those subjects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s)
are the gold standard for treating PD, but the mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Recent evidence
has identified that orexin hypothalamic neurons are one of the key regulators of a coordinated panic response
and that patients with panic do indeed have high levels of orexin in their cerebrospinal fluid. Our preclinical
work has identified that orexin plays critical role in panic in models of pathological panic, but little is known
about how serotonin regulate this system in the context of panic and phobias.
 In order to address this gap in knowledge, we will employ traditional pharmacological and
immunohistochemical techniques with novel opto- and chemo-genetic techniques to: Aim 1) elucidate the role
of midbrain serotonergic system projection to the panic-ON hypothalamic OX system in regulating normal
panic; Aim 2) how disruption of this system results in PD-like pathology; and Aim 3) how ventromedial
prefrontal cortical projections to this serotonergic system also regulates panic. We will measure behavioral and
cardiovascular panic/fear responses with additional molecular and electrophysiological endpoints.
 The proposed project will test a clear hypothetical model, basedlargely on empirical data from our own
laboratories for the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying development of acute and chronic panic-like states.
This proposal is innovative because it uses state-of-the-art approaches to, for the 1st time, investigate the functional
properties of subpopulations of serotonergic neurons withinthe DRN and MRN relevant to specific symptoms of
severe anxiety disorders. If our hypotheses are further supported by the aims proposed here, it will emphasize the
need to develop successful therapies for anxiety disorders that have the ability to inhibit panic and fear learning
circuits by modulating these distinct functional subsets of serotonergic neurons.

10894126,"Abstract
Basic cellular processes essential to mammalian tissue development and adult regeneration, are
often controlled by gene expression regulation at the mRNA level. Total mRNA level for each
gene depends on two mechanisms: active (or ‘nascent’) transcription and post-transcriptional
RNA stability/degradation (e.g. turnover rates). Nascent transcription itself is regulated by
multiple steps of recruiting histone-modifying enzymes and opening chromatin, RNA polymerase
II (Pol II) initiation and pausing, and the release of Pol II into productive RNA elongation. Diverse
mechanisms that regulate total mRNA level may be important in controlling distinct biological
processes and pathologies, but this is poorly understood in vivo. Using skin as a model system
we will map lineage-specific gene patterns of RNA Pol II activity and nascent transcription in
specific cell-types within their natural tissue milieu in the absence of cell isolation. Furthermore,
we will investigate changes in these nascent-transcription patterns along an adult tissue stem cell
activation and differentiation path, using hair follicle as a lineage prototype. In addition, our work
will help dissect relative contributions of active transcription vs post-transcriptional RNA
turnover/stability to overall mRNA levels in specific cell types in vivo. Furthermore, we will
determine how a known histone repressive mark (H3K9me3), poorly understood in mammalian
tissues, acts on nascent transcription and RNA Pol II pausing in vivo. We will uncover for the first
time the physiological role of the 3 main H3K9me3 histone methyl transferases in skin
development and homeostasis. Finally, we will investigate how H3K9me3 acts on nascent
transcription in vivo using our newly developed mouse genetics tools and methodologies. Our
work will provide previously unavailable mechanistic insight into gene regulation in mammalian
tissue biology using skin as a model system."

PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 2 Nonlinear algorithms such as model-based reconstruction (MBR) and deep learning (DL) reconstruction have
 3 sparked tremendous research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional linear approaches, the nonline-
 4 arity of these algorithm transcends traditional signal-to-noise requirement and offer flexibility to draw information
 5 from a variety of sources (e.g., statistical model, prior image, dictionary, training data). MBR has enabled numer-
 6 ous advancements including low-dose CT and advanced scanning protocols. Deep learning algorithms are rap-
 7 idly emerging and have demonstrated superior dose vs. image quality tradeoffs in research settings. However,
 8 widespread clinical adoption of nonlinear algorithms has been impeded by the lack of a lack of systematic, quan-
 9 titative methods for performance analysis. Nonlinear methods come with numerous dependencies on the imag-
10 ing techniques, the imaging target, and the prior information, and the data itself. The relationship between these
11 dependencies and image quality is often opaque. Furthermore, improper selection of algorithmic parameters can
12 lead to erroneous features (e.g., smaller lesions, texture) in the reconstruction. Therefore, methods to quantify
13 and predict performance permit efficient and quantifiable performance evaluation to provide the robust control
14 and understanding of imaging output necessary for reliable clinical application and regulatory oversight.
15 We propose to establish a robust, predictive framework for performance assessment and optimization that can
16 be generalized to any reconstruction method. We quantify performance in turns of the perturbation response and
17 covariance as a function of imaging techniques, system configurations, patient anatomy, and, importantly, the
18 perturbation itself. The perturbation response quantifies the appearance (e.g., biases, blurs, distortions), and,
19 together with the covariance, allows the computation of more complex metrics such as task-based performance
20 and radiomic measures including size, shape, and texture information. We illustrate utility of the approach in lung
21 imaging with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a lesion library and generate perturbations encom-
22 passing clinically relevant features. We will extract lesions from public databases and develop methods lesion
23 emulation in for realistic CT simulation and physical data via 3D printing technology. Aim 2: Develop a gener-
24 alized prediction framework for perturbation response and covariance. Using analytical and neural network
25 modeling, we will establish a framework that predicts perturbation response and covariance across imaging
26 scenarios for classes of algorithms with increasing data-dependence including MBR with a Huber penalty, MBR
27 with dictionary regularization, and a deep learning reconstructor. Aim 3: Develop assessment and optimiza-
28 tion strategies to drive robust, low dose lung screening CT methods. We will optimize and adapt nonlinear
29 algorithms and protocols for lung cancer screening to achieve faithful representations of clinical features. This
30 work has the potential to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality
31 to diagnostic performance and optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms.

10755653,"Inflammatory rheumatologic diseases affect millions of individuals and represent a significant public health
burden. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of rheumatic disease, but
molecular diagnoses and mechanistic insights into the causes of adult-onset disease are incomplete. In addition,
although there are many effective treatments, a significant percentage of patients remains poorly controlled on
current standard of care therapies. It is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the molecular signaling
underlying these life-threatening diseases, which in turn will lead to more effective treatments. To date, a wealth
of genetic data has identified common polymorphisms associated with rheumatologic diseases, however very
few causative and targetable variants have been identified.
We have performed a genotype-first analysis looking for mutations in genes in the ubiquitin pathway in our cohort
of patients with undiagnosed inflammatory disorders and have identified affected individuals who share somatic,
missense mutations in the UBA1 gene at the same codon, p.Met41 (Beck DB et al, NEJM). All of these individuals
have overlapping disease manifestations, including fevers, pulmonary infiltrates, skin lesions, arthralgias,
peripheral blood counts concerning for hematologic malignancy, characteristic vacuolization of hematopoietic
precursor cells, and a failure to respond to any therapy other than high dose corticosteroids. We have named
this disease VEXAS (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory Somatic) syndrome. Patients with
VEXAS syndrome meet clinical criteria for seemingly disparate inflammatory (relapsing polychondritis,
polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis) and hematologic (myelodysplastic syndrome or plasma cell dyscrasias)
conditions. UBA1 p.Met41 mutations are restricted to the myeloid lineage, primarily absent from lymphoid
lineages, and cause severe inflammatory disease. Furthermore, we have identified that mutations in UBA1 at
p.Met41 lead to altered protein isoform expression and translation of a toxic isoform. In the work proposed here,
I will study how mosaic mutations in myeloid cells result in aberrant myeloid and lymphoid lineage development
and inflammation at the cellular and molecular level (Aim 1). I will then characterize the prevalence and
penetrance of UBA1 mutations and find additional genetic causes of other late-onset inflammatory diagnoses
(Aim 2). Based on our current findings, I hypothesize that somatic variants are an overlooked cause of many
severe, adult-onset inflammatory diseases. Our results with VEXAS syndrome demonstrate that by analyzing
genetic variants in a broad spectrum of severe inflammatory diseases we can uncover common underlying
mechanisms of pathogenesis which may reveal clinically important reclassifications of disease and ultimately
lead to improved clinical care."

To adapt to metabolic cues and survive stresses like nutrient starvation, cells store high-
energy lipids in specialized organelles called lipid droplets (LDs) that emerge from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the metabolic center of cells. Recent studies reveal that
LDs serve many roles in cell physiology, but how they are functionally ear-marked for
specific tasks is unclear. Indeed, the ER network itself executes numerous cellular
functions, but how this functional diversity is mechanistically achieved is unclear. The
purpose of this grant is to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which LDs and
the ER network achieve functional diversity at the sub-organelle level. Capitalizing
on published and preliminary data, we find that LDs exhibit unique surface proteomes
that provide functional specificity for LDs within single cells. Furthermore, we find that
inter-organelle contact sites define ER sub-domains with specific roles in the
compartmentalization of mevalonate metabolism. Here, I outline three directions that
enable the mechanistic dissection of LD and ER functional compartmentalization:
1) In direction 1, we will leverage yeast genetics, biochemistry, and metabolic
 dissection to dissect how yeast ER-lysosome contacts (called nucleus-vacuole
 junctions, NVJs) serve as ER sub-domains and “metabolic platforms” that spatially
 compartmentalize mevalonate metabolism, and promote metabolic remodeling
 during glucose starvation.
2) In direction 2, we will capitalize on a large-scale screen to dissect how LDs are
 labeled with specific proteins to enable unique roles within cells.
3) In direction 3, we will utilize state-of-the-art cryo-FIB-SEM imaging to dissect how
 lipid phase transitions within LDs selectively remodel the LD surface proteome, and
 ultimately influence LD function and LD inter-organelle contact sites.
Collectively, these directions will provide insights into new cellular organizational
principles that enable to LDs and the ER network to achieve a functional division-of-
labor. They will also characterize lipid phase transition properties of sterols, which
promote disease pathologies in obesity, heart disease, and atherosclerosis."
10755669,"Project Summary (Abstract)
Cardiovascular complications caused by cancer therapy are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer
patients and survivors. Cardiotoxicity of traditional cancer therapies, such as anthracyclines, as well as more
selective, targeted therapies, have been well documented and underlying mechanisms of cardiac injury
thoroughly studied. Cardiovascular toxicity of a newer, very promising therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICI), is not well delineated and presents a significant diagnostic and patient management challenge for cardio-
oncologists. Furthermore, cardiac damage of increasingly used chemo/ICI combinatorial therapies has not been
investigated to any significant extent. Due to the advantage of being noninvasive, cardiac imaging is the most
commonly used technique for monitoring cardiac function during and after cancer therapy, but current methods
lack molecular specificity and are unable to detect cardiotoxicity sufficiently early to allow timely intervention and
amelioration of cardiovascular risks. Inability of currently used imaging methods to detect subclinical cardiac
involvement represents a major bottleneck for prevention and better management of cardiac complications in
cancer patients and survivors. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using agents that target early
indicators of cardiovascular toxicity could offer a powerful and highly specific noninvasive tool for detection of
subclinical cardiac toxicity associated with traditional as well as ICI cancer therapy. We propose to investigate
[18F]F-AraG, a PET agent with a unique ability to evaluate a pathophysiological centerpiece of both ICI
and anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity - activated T cells and mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes
- as an imaging biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of cardiotoxicity associated with ICI as
well as chemotherapy. The immediate goal of this project is to investigate the correlation between myocardial
[18F]F-AraG uptake and processes that drive ICI and anthracycline (doxorubicin) cardiotoxicity. The long-term
goal is development of a highly sensitive and specific technique to guide interventions in early, subclinical phases
of cardiac dysfunction. The proposed research will deliver a unique and clinic-ready imaging approach to
address a key clinical problem in cardio-oncology: noninvasive detection of cardiotoxicity at an early
stage to allow therapeutic interventions and reduction of cardiovascular risks. The proposed imaging

10756096,"Project Summary/Abstract
African American (AA) women experience disproportionately higher rates of chronic diseases compared to White
women, including being twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease. Physical activity (PA) is a key
protective factor for reducing risk for chronic diseases, yet only 35% of AA women meet national PA guidelines.
Persistent disparities in chronic disease and pre-mature death among African American women across the adult
lifespan highlight the need for developing effective interventions for increasing PA among AA women. We
propose that community settings hold tremendous promise as an important context for reaching AA women, but
the role of social affiliation has been understudied in past community-based interventions as a key mechanism
for engaging AA women in long-term PA. A variety of theories have highlighted the importance of social affiliation
for health promotion and have defined social affiliation through several distinct but related constructs. Social
Cognitive Theory (SCT) proposes that the group context promotes social learning and collective efficacy, while
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Group Dynamics Theory (GDT) have emphasized the importance of
positive interactions between group members in order to promote relatedness, reciprocal support, and group
cohesion. Social affiliation within group-based programs may be especially important to AA women, given that
collectivism (belief in the importance of advancing the group over the individual) is a prominent cultural value for
many AAs. Despite converging evidence highlighting the importance of social affiliation from a motivational and
cultural perspective, this factor has been minimally integrated within intervention designs and rarely targeted as
a central mechanism for increasing PA. Our investigative team provides strong preliminary data for expanding
on previous community-based PA interventions for inactive AA women by targeting social affiliation through a
combination of collaborative and competitive strategies. Drawing from SDT, SCT, GDT, and a cultural values
framework, The Together Everyone Achieve More Physical Activity (TEAM-PA) trial evaluates the efficacy of a
group-based social affiliation intervention (vs. a standard group-delivered PA comparison program) for increasing
PA among inactive AA women. Using a group cohort randomized design implemented at community centers
across five years, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the 10-week TEAM-PA group-based
intervention (vs. comparison program) on increasing accelerometry-assessed minutes per day of total PA (light
to vigorous activities) from baseline to post-intervention and maintenance at a 6-month follow-up [Primary Aim
1]. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of the TEAM-PA intervention on secondary outcomes (percentage
meeting national recommendations for PA, light PA, sedentary behavior, body mass index, blood pressure)
[Secondary Aims 1-2] and potential mediators of the intervention effect on changes in PA [Secondary Aim 3]."
10756100,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY (revisions in
orange font
)
Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a 12-14 month median survival rate, ~10% chance of 5-year survival,
and ~90% likelihood of recurrence, even after receiving standard of care (SOC), which involves tumor resection,
fractionated radiation therapy (XRT), and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). There is growing evidence
that this poor prognosis and dismal therapy responsiveness emerges from interplay of tumor cell heterogeneity
and non-genetic, treatment-induced shifts of cellular phenotypic states. Notably, the SOC has been shown to
drive a shift of tumor cells from a drug-susceptible proneural (PN) subtype to a drug-resistant mesenchymal
(MES) subtype. This partly explains why primary GBM tumors of the classical or PN subtype often recur as the
more aggressive and drug-resistant MES subtype. To complicate matters further, extrinsic signals and stressors
can drive dedifferentiation of a heterogeneous tumor cell population into immature, glioma stem-like cells
(GSCs), which have been implicated in tumor recurrence. GSCs are resistant to multiple cytotoxic drugs like
TMZ, which motivates the need for discovering novel cytotoxic drugs, including drugs repurposed from other
indications, to treat GBM. Notably, we have discovered that off-label FDA-approved drugs are effective against
patient-derived GSCs (PD-GSCs) increasing median survival of patients by >3X, but can also induce transition
of a surviving subpopulation from a susceptible PN subtype to a MES subtype – called PN-to-MES transition
(PMT). Here, we propose to elucidate at single-cell resolution the mechanisms by which diverse drugs induce
PMT within a heterogeneous population of GSCs. We hypothesize that early response to drug treatments will
vary by mechanisms of action of drugs and patient-specific characteristics of PD-GSCs, but cytotoxic events will
drive these responses onto a common pathway that can be targeted with genetic and chemical interventions to
block drug-induced PMT. We will test this hypothesis by single-cell profiling of longitudinal changes in
transcription (scRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq), and phenotypes of up to 34 patient-derived
GSCs (PD-GSCs) across 76 FDA approved anti-proliferative compounds. We will integrate the longitudinal multi-
omic profiles to discover the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that mechanistically drives drug-induced
PMT in each PD-GSC. By comparing TRNs across PD-GSCs and drug treatments, we will identify, perturb, and
characterize mechanisms of drug-induced PMT in each PD-GSC. Using FDA-approved drugs mapped to
validated mechanisms, we will perform high throughput screens to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of our
model-driven approach to identify drug combinations that synergistically kill PD-GSCs, without inducing PMT.
Outcomes of this project include (i) methodology to elucidate single-cell resolution TRNs within subpopulations
of a heterogeneous tumor, (ii) insight into mechanisms of drug-induced PMT in PD-GSCs, and (iii) a rational
strategy to repurpose, and tailor FDA-approved combination drug regimens for off-label use in treating GBM.

10756561,"PROJECT SUMMARY: COMMUNITY OUTREACH & ENGAGEMENT (COE)
The catchment area of the Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium includes 13 counties in
western Washington (WA). This area has 5.03 million individuals of whom 32.3% are racial/ethnic minorities.
Consortium leadership defined the catchment area to include the vast majority of incident cancers seen by the
Consortium, with 83% of Consortium cases arising from this area.
The Office of Community Outreach & Engagement (OCOE), established in 2017 by the Consortium, grew from
the Health Disparities Research Center which was founded by Fred Hutch in 2010 and gained funding from the
2015-2019 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG). Since 2017, the Consortium OCOE led a needs
assessment process to define the cancer burden in the catchment area and comprehensively identify and
guide efforts to address the cancer burden and inequities. The top five cancer sites for incidence and mortality
include lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, and hematologic malignancies. The largest inequities for cancer
incidence and mortality were among American Indian and Alaskan Natives (AIAN) and non-Hispanic blacks
(NHB). Rural counties furthest from the Consortium sites also had the highest cancer incidence and mortality.
Our goal is to attain health equity for all individuals, regardless of their race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
geographic residence, or any other potentially limiting factor. Therefore, the specific aims of the OCOE are to:
 1. Define and continuously monitor the cancer burden in the catchment area
 2. Use an equitable, bidirectional approach to implement outreach and inreach education and programs to
 reduce the cancer burden in the catchment area
 3. Promote research relevant to the catchment area to reduce the burden of cancer, including research
 between catchment communities and the Consortium
 4. Continue and expand cancer research in high need areas beyond the catchment area
To achieve these aims, the OCOE has made the needs assessment a continuous process and convened a
Community Action Coalition, consisting of stakeholders representing all 13 catchment area counties, to review
and guide our response to the dynamic needs of the area. Working with communities in the catchment area,
the OCOE supports an expanded outreach and research infrastructure, which includes expansion of patient
navigation and community health educators to promote engagement of catchment area populations as well as
a new catchment-focused pilot grants program, all of which include an additional emphasis on those with the
highest cancer inequities (i.e., AIAN, NHB, and rural populations)."
10756562,"PROJECT SUMMARY: DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS 
Developmental funds were used in the last cycle for recruiting new investigators, supporting developmental 
projects, creating new shared resources, and helping fund several key staff investigators. Several outstanding 
investigators who received recruitment funds during the project period would not have come to Seattle without 
the extra support that was offered through the availability of CCSG New Investigator Awards, distributed to 
faculty from Fred Hutch (FH), University of Washington (UW), and Seattle Children’s (SC). The availability of 
CCSG Pilot Award funding provides investigators a very tangible benefit of Cancer Consortium membership 
and has stimulated new initiatives and collaborations that would otherwise not have occurred, particularly in 
transdisciplinary science, cancer health disparities, and catchment area health. Funds to catalyze new Shared 
Resource development have afforded Consortium members access to technologies and expertise that would 
otherwise not be sustainable in an individual laboratory or even on an institutional basis. Finally, developmental 
funds help support staff investigators focused on enhancing our community outreach and engagement efforts. 
During the last grant period, Developmental Funds supported the recruitment of 33 productive Consortium 
faculty members in areas of strategic growth and funded 45 Pilot Award projects. Together, these faculty 
members and pilot projects gave rise to a total of 439 publications and over $28M in new follow-on funding. In 
the last cycle, Developmental Funds were instrumental in the formation of the Hutch Data Commonwealth and 
supported two Special Populations Staff Investigators, both of whom continue to lead efforts to reduce 
disparities in underserved populations and one of whom has become the new Director of our Office of 
Community Outreach & Engagement. In this application, we are requesting funds to support future Pilot and 
New Investigator Awards, two new Special Populations Staff Investigators, and a Preclinical Models Shared 
Resource."
10756564,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM)
Part I: Clinical Research Support (CRS). CRS includes 65 FTEs who provide centralized support for the
conduct of cancer-related clinical research on behalf of the all Consortium institutions. The integrated CRS
provides the infrastructure and processes to efficiently and effectively support over 176 Consortium
investigators on all cancer clinical research studies and serves as the central repository of clinical research
information. In FY 2018, CRS reported the recruitment of 10,716 individuals onto all clinical research studies
(5,424 interventional and 5,292 non-interventional accruals) and facilitated activation of 180 studies (150
interventional), including 66 institutional and externally peer-reviewed studies.
Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM). DSM is required for all interventional studies. For
investigator-initiated studies, a well-established internal Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
performs risk-based monitoring to ensure the highest levels of patient safety. In addition, effective quality
control functions promote protocol compliance in accordance with sponsor requirements and the NCI-
approved Consortium Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). In FY 2018, the DSMC monitored 118 studies,
which included the review of 58 reports from study-specific DSMBs.
Part III: Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research. The Consortium leads multiple, proactive
efforts to promote the recruitment of women and minorities. In FY 2018, among the 5,424 individuals
enrolled onto interventional studies, 61% were women and enrollments consisted of 10% ethnic Hispanics
and 23% non-White racial minorities, which compares favorably to catchment area demographics of 50%
women, 10% Hispanic, and 24% non-White racial minorities.
Part IV: Inclusion of Children in Research. The Consortium supports the NIH policy on the inclusion of
children in research. The Consortium is an active member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)
Children’s Oncology Group and several other national pediatric oncology trial consortia. Enhancements to
our Children’s clinical research infrastructure have supported significant growth in Consortium enrollments.
In FY 2018, 153 of the 286 (54%) newly registered pediatric patients enrolled on an interventional treatment
trial compared to 85 of 240 (35%) in FY 2014. An additional 296 children were accrued to interventional
non-treatment trials in FY 2018, up from 195 in FY 2014."
10756567,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
A single Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) governs all oncology clinical trial protocols across
the Consortium partner institutions and assures that cancer-relevant human research is (1) scientifically
important and statistically sound; (2) designed appropriately without excluding special populations for non-
scientific reason; (3) feasible, with reasonably attainable accrual targets given the available patient population;
and (4) supportive of the research mission of the Consortium. The central feature of the PRMS is the Scientific
Review Committee (SRC). The PRMS committee structure is responsible for approving protocols that meet its
stringent and well-defined criteria. A Research Group Review is required prior to submission to the SRC as
part of a two-stage review process and assures that Consortium protocols are of high scientific merit and
feasible prior to investing additional institutional resources in development.
The SRC evaluates scientific merit, feasibility, prioritization, and progress of all Consortium clinical trial
protocols. As part of the Consortium’s trial activation process, SRC approval is required prior to IRB review.
Efficient operations and weekly SRC meetings have resulted in a median overall process time of 14 calendar
days (10 business days) which has remained consistent since 2015. The PRMS further ensures that during
accrual, the scientific rationale for the protocol has remained relevant and that accrual is sufficient to meet the
scientific aims of the trial. Since implementation of the updated Low Accrual Policy in FY 2015, the number of
reviews and closures increased from 25 trials reviewed and three closures, to 74 reviewed and 24 closed in FY
2018. All protocols approved by PRMS have access to CCSG-supported centralized resources, including
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) and the Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR). PRMS has the
ultimate authority to close trials that do not demonstrate scientific progress."
10757737,"Project Summary
The benefit of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) unfortunately has limited transferability to less
studied minority populations. Participants of GWAS are typically of European descent and transferability of
genomic insights gained from GWAS is dependent on how closely related the populations are in either history
or characteristics. As a result, there exists a growing disparity when it comes to the understanding of disease
incidence and genetic risk factors for non-European populations. There are also factors that impede the study
of minority populations including limited cohort size, the lack of genomic resources, and admixture history and
population structure that may complicate the study design and analysis. However, focused studies of minority
populations, even with smaller sample sizes, have been shown to provide population-specific genetic insights.
The goals of this proposal are (1) to generate genomic resources for the Native Hawaiian minority population
necessary for accurate and systematic analyses, and (2) to leverage these resources and the unique
population history of Native Hawaiians to identify genetic risk factors associated with complex traits. These
goals will help reduce the barriers to current and future studies of Native Hawaiians and also reduce the gap in
our understanding of health in their population. In order to accomplish this, Aim 1 and Aim 2 focus on creating
an imputation reference panel and recombination map specific to the Native Hawaiians, respectively. An
imputation reference panel specific to a population has been shown to increase genotype imputation quality of
both common and rare variants that would not otherwise be included in a genetic study. A recombination map
is a critical resource that is utilized in haplotype-based inference (such as local ancestry inference or identity-
by-descent segment detection), which is critical for admixed populations such as the Native Hawaiians. Lastly,
in Aim 3, we will use these resources and exploit the population history of the Native Hawaiians to identify
genomic regions associated with complex traits. We will leverage the expected increase in deleterious alleles
found in homozygous state and use identity-by-descent mapping to identify regions associated with diseases
previously shown to have elevated risks in Native Hawaiians (obesity, type-2 diabetes, or cardiovascular
diseases). In summary, this work will provide genomic resources specific to the Native Hawaiians and related
populations, but also explore the relationship between traits and disease that may impact all populations."
10757741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myotendinous junctions are the direct interface between muscle and tendon and the affected site in
traumatic
muscle injury and myotendinous rupture. Given the inconsistent effectiveness of existing treatments for
myotendinous injuries, we propose developing an alternative approach using human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs). Such cells have the capacity to create progenitor cells that can contribute to muscle and tendon
regeneration. Our specific goals of this study are to engineer iPSC-derived muscle-tendon units and evaluate
their utility as an in vitro model to study myotendinous junction formation, and to repair damages in muscle,
tendon, and myotendinous junctions. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that iPSC-derived
musculoskeletal progenitor cells (skeletal muscle progenitor cells and tendon progenitor cells) will interact with
each other and form a muscle-tendon unit with functional myotendinous junctions. This hypothesis is supported
by our published studies and preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of producing human musculoskeletal
tissues from iPSCs. In this proposal, we will prepare lines of human tendon progenitor cells (hTPCs) from iPSCs.
The established cells will be co-cultured with iPSC-derived skeletal muscle progenitor cells (hSMPCs) using
newly featured cell culture systems for iPSCs, two-dimensional micropatterned culture platforms (Aim 1).
Topographical and molecular guidance from the micropatterns can simulate cellular and molecular complexity
in musculoskeletal development and pathology. Next, we will create three-dimensional muscle-tendon tissue
cultures using iPSC-derived musculoskeletal progenitor cells and analyze their anatomical and physiological
properties to extend the utility of iPSCs for modeling myotendinous junction formation (Aim 2). Throughout the
development of these 3D culture models, we hope to identify the roles of exogenous stimulations such as
signaling molecules and mechanical loads for muscle-tendon differentiation and myotendinous junction
formation. Lastly, we will test the capacity of iPSC-derived muscle-tendon tissues to regenerate injured muscle,
tendon, and myotendinous junctions by studying implantation in a rat model of complete myotendinous junction
rupture (Aim 3). These aims will provide highly novel insights into effective approaches using iPSC-based in vitro
modeling and treatments. As iPSCs can now be derived from human adult somatic tissues, this approach can
be used to develop patient-specific, cell-based in vitro models and therapy for human disease. The results of
this project will accelerate progress towards effective treatments for patients with musculoskeletal disorders.
Given the lack of effective treatments for myotendinous injuries and the consequential burden it places on
society, this study is both urgent and timely."
10757742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Secondary pneumonia occurs frequently in patients with acutely injured lungs and increases the mortality of
acute lung injury. Although acute lung injury is caused by a variety of pulmonary and systemic insults, all
etiologies of acute lung injury result in compromised integrity of the blood-air barrier, allowing an influx of protein-
rich, serum-derived fluid in the pulmonary airspace. Consequently, the microenvironment within acutely injured
lungs is radically altered from health and provides a selective advantage to the outgrowth of pneumonia-
associated pathogens. However, the factors that enable bacterial growth in acutely injured lungs are unknown.
The objective of this study is to determine which soluble factors in the injured lung enhance the survival of
pneumonia-associated bacteria by serving as bacterial nutrients. Using the proposed research plan, we will test
the central hypothesis that the influx of serum-derived edema into the injured lung microenvironment
increases the diversity and quantity of substrates which can be taken up and metabolized by pneumonia-
associated bacteria, enhancing bacterial growth and fitness in the injured lung microenvironment. We
will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1) determine the bacterial nutrient uptake systems
and metabolic pathways that provide fitness advantages for pneumonia-associated bacteria in the injured lung
microenvironment, and (2) determine the diversity and quantity of bacterial nutrient substrates that become
available in the injured lung microenvironment and enhance bacterial growth. To accomplish these specific aims,
we will employ Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, two of the most common pneumonia-
associated pathogens, along with a murine model of oxygen-induced lung injury and a novel ex vivo culture
system to compare differences in bacterial growth and gene expression between healthy and injured lung
microenvironments. To complement the murine modeling and ex vivo bacterial culture, we will perform targeted
metabolite analysis to detect the presence of host-derived nutrients that support bacterial growth in injured lungs.
We will use bacterial knockouts, competitive co-culture, and in vitro nutrient modulation experiments to validate
our findings. This study will identify specific, injury-associated nutrients that directly promote bacterial growth in
acutely injured lungs and establish the influence of nutrient availability on the progression from respiratory
dysbiosis to secondary bacterial infection in the context of acute lung injury. Furthermore, the results of this study
will provide a mechanistic basis for the development of clinical interventions for patients with acute lung injury at
risk for pneumonia. Successful completion of the proposed research and training plan will enable Ms. Baker to
develop professional skills pertaining to communication and leadership and unique interdisciplinary expertise in
pulmonary pathobiology, bacterial pathogenesis, and bioinformatics. This F31 award will be essential for her
continued professional and scientific development and will equip her for the next step of her professional journey
to become an independent academic researcher in the field of pulmonary host-microbiome interactions."
11114099,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Soft tissues sarcomas (STS) is a broad term for multiple subtypes of cancer that start in soft tissues. Most STS
are treated in the same way in the clinic regardless of the subtype. STS encompasses over 50 histologic and
molecular subtypes, with each displaying variable clinical behavior. There is currently no unifying treatment
for STS subtypes beyond surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
Resolute Science Inc. is developing novel STS therapy by using TAMs to process and deliver anti-cancer agents
to solid tumors. Targeting TAMs to kill the associated cancer has the advantage of being tumor-agnostic
compared to that of targeting a specific cancer cell receptor. This approach bypasses concerns of tumor
heterogeneity and evolved resistance associated with therapeutics that target specific properties of each cancer
type. Our lead therapeutic, RS-5, is well-tolerated and demonstrated strong anti-cancer efficacy across multiple
murine sarcoma tumor models, including the subcutaneous (sc) and intracranial (ic) HT1080 sarcoma cell line
model and a doxorubicin-resistant patient derived xenograft (PDX) sarcoma model. Resolute’s modular drug
design allows for straightforward chemical substitutions of ligand, backbone, linker, and payloads. Finally, the
cost of commercial manufacturing will be significantly lower than that of antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs) which could significantly reduce the price of this cancer treatment for patients and insurers.
The overall goal of the Fast-Track program is to conduct studies that further show the efficacy of Resolute’s
platform molecule as therapy for different STS subtypes and perform pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) and
IND-enabling studies. Our Phase I goal for this SBIR Fast-Track proposal is to validate the choice of one subtype
of STS, Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS) as an initial clinical indication for RS-5. The measure of
success to advance to Phase II is 1) establish dose response of RS-5 in a doxorubicin-resistant UPS model, 2)
establish anti-cancer efficacy equal or better than doxorubicin in a doxorubicin-naive PDX model, 3) demonstrate
anti-cancer efficacy in both male and female mice, 4) establish contribution of MTM to anti-cancer efficacy from
that of RS-5. In Phase II, we will perform pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) and IND-enabling studies with
potential expansion into other STS subtypes through additional efficacy studies. The measure of success for
Phase II is 1) demonstrate comparable or better anti-cancer efficacy of RS-5 at a well-tolerated dose to that of
doxorubicin at a well-tolerated dose in at least 1 additional PDX model, 2) the successful validation of bio-
analytical methods for nonclinical toxicology species and humans, and 3) conduct IND-enabling studies.
Completion of this Fast-Track proposal will result in validation of STS as our first clinical indication for RS-5 and
completion of the IND-enabling studies to support the clinical development of RS-5. Once completed, the Phase
I and II work will provide a rapid path for RS-5 to obtain approval for Phase I clinical testing."

Longstanding racial and socioeconomic inequities in the US, underpinned by historical legacies
of systemic racism, oppression and exploitation, have burdened Black people and increased
their risk of adverse maternal and reproductive health outcomes. Through Reproductive Justice,
anti-racist scholarship and social justice praxis, researchers and clinicians are increasingly
advocating for and innovating approaches that center and empower the community's lived
experience. The Equity in Maternal and Birthing outcomes and Reproductive HeAlth through
Community Engagement (EMBRACE) Center is a multidisciplinary community-academic
partnership to advance maternal and reproductive health for Black people in Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania and augment training in anti-oppression praxis for care providers, researchers,
and policy advocates. Leveraging existing and developing relationships, as well as our
leadership expertise, the EMBRACE Center consists of three multi-level research projects: 1)
implementation of a community health worker model to support postpartum recovering among
Black birthing people at risk for severe maternal morbidity; 2) integration of enhanced
postpartum (4th trimester) and interconception care centering Black families; and 3) evaluation
of policies governing maternal and reproductive health equity among Black populations. Two
components (Community and Training) will provide support and structure across the center to
ensure community partnership and thought leadership in all phases of the work and training and
capacity building for reproductive justice and equity. In line with the Center's vision, researchers
and community collaborators (many of them Black-led organizations) will employ power-sharing
approaches that value diverse forms of knowledge and dissemination processes in equitable,
accessible ways. We expect the work of EMBRACE to result in sustainable approaches and
interventions that will advance maternal and reproductive health equity justice and improve
health and well-being for Black women, femmes, and gender expansive people."

This is a revised application, modified to fully respond to reviewers’ comments and FDA interactions since the
application (FDA pre-IND meeting held on Sept. 25, 2018). The proposed work will complete IND-enabling
studies to progress cell replacement paradigms into the clinic using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived dopamine (DA) neurons, and a first-in-man clinical trial for autologous transplantation in Parkinson’s
disease (PD). Cell replacement therapy with midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons provides cellular and synaptic
repair in the parkinsonian brain, and addresses both the motor symptoms of PD as well as levodopa-induced
dyskinesias. Our previous fetal cell transplantation work shows that in PD patients transplanted mDA neurons
remain healthy and can provide remarkable therapeutic benefit for decades. While fetal cell transplantations
are not scalable for a larger patient population and require immunosuppression, iPSCs are a promising
alternative cell source. iPSCs generated from PD patients can be differentiated into midbrain dopaminergic
cells, frozen and used for autologous transplantation.
The NINDS CREATE Bio Development Track U01 proposal over 5 years consists of milestones within four
Specific Aims, that includes a Phase I clinical trial in human patients with PD. In Specific Aim 1 we will transfer
the remaining mDA neuron product quality control assays for qualification in the cGMP facility, perform FDA-
guided quality control of excipients for the clinical product, and produce mDA neurons to be used in IND-
enabling studies. In Specific Aim 2, definitive IND-enabling studies will be performed to test the safety
(tumorigenicity and biodistribution) and efficacy of human iPSC-derived frozen-thawed mDA neurons in
rodents, as well as testing of the planned clinical delivery device in non-human primates. Specific Aim 3 will
include IND package preparation and filing for an Investigator-initiated Phase I clinical trial, recruitment of
patients with PD and generation of autologous cGMP iPSCs and mDA neurons as well as release criteria
testing of the cryopreserved clinical product. Finally, Specific Aim 4 is a first-in-human clinical Phase I
interventional, open-label clinical trial in 6 patients with sporadic PD, to test the safety and efficacy of
autologous transplantation of frozen-thawed mDA neurons.
This highly innovative autologous CMC iPS cell technology U01 proposal for cell replacement clinical trials in
PD patients provides a necessary step and exploration for the development of successful cell therapy for PD
and several neurological disorders."
10763720,"A quarter to more than one half of the ~ one million people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in North
America will either present with lupus nephritis (LN) or will develop LN at some point in the course of their
disease. The available treatment tools include immunosuppressive drugs and the recently added Benlysta and
the calcineurin inhibitor, voclosporin. They are not specific drugs with the first three causing major side effects,
whereas, the last two have a small, albeit desirable, clinical benefit. Better understanding of the pathogenesis
of LN will advance our progress towards the development of reliable biomarkers and approaches to treat
patients in a precise manner. Early studies have indicated that kidney resident cells (podocytes, mesangial
and tubular epithelial cells) when exposed to the autoinflammatory environment that is prevalent in patients
with LN, they upregulate immunomodulatory molecules including a serine/threonine kinase IV (CaMK4) and
interleukin 23 receptor (IL-23R) which enable kidney inflammation and damage. When kidney resident cells
lack any of these molecules, inflammation is averted. Importantly, urine podocytes and tubular epithelial cells
present molecular abnormalities which reflect those in the kidney tissue. In this project, the hypothesis will be
tested that in response to peripheral autoimmune elements, kidney resident cells undergo molecular changes
which are requisite for the development of kidney inflammation and injury. The hypothesis will be tested in
three sets of experiments. In the first it will be demonstrated that CaMK4 and IL-23R in podocytes are
requisite for the development off LN; in the second it will be demonstrated that upregulation of CaMK4 and IL-
23R in tumular epithelial cells alters their metabolic profile and enables them to produce chemokines that

that upregulation of CaMK4 and IL-23R in urine cells reflects kidney tissue pathology, and second, that the
recording of these molecules in the urine can predict the development of LN in patients with SLE. The project
will use a number of novel tools availed in the laboratory and by the cores (single cell and spatial
transcriptomics and nanoparticle delivery of medicine to kidney resident cells) of this project program grant
along with conditionally knock out mice and a well-established lupus cohort. The project addresses directly
three unmet needs in LN: understanding of pathogenesis, development of precision treatment approaches and
high-fidelity biomarkers."

 Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are non-coital methods of conception that are used to treat
infertility and achieve a pregnancy. As many as 9 million births worldwide have resulted from ART. In the
coming years, it is expected that the number of births by ART will increase as more couples postpone having
children or infertility arises on a more regular basis. Procedures used in ART include complex techniques such
as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and as well as less complex procedures such
as gamete and embryo cryopreservation and preimplantation genetic testing. Recently, work from various
laboratories has shown that ART is associated with health risks for mothers and fetuses such as stillbirth,
preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, abnormal placentation, and other pregnancy complications. Also,
more recent studies have shown that IVF offspring can develop metabolic and/or cardiovascular outcomes
during adulthood. Mouse models support these clinical observations and have shown that adult IVF offspring
can develop metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes. Technologies used in assisted reproduction are
continuously refined to increase pregnancy success, but the effects of newer techniques have not been
assessed prior to implementation. Because the reproductive system has been shown to be sensitive to
perturbations during intrauterine development potentially impacting future functions, the main object of this
proposal is to study how IVF procedures affect normal function of reproductive system in IVF offspring in mice
and elucidate underlying genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in observed outcomes. Because
females and males have unique pathways and physiological functions their reproductive systems cannot be
analyzed together, for this reason aim 1 of this proposal will address changes in morphology, cell composition,
transcriptome, histone posttranslational modifications and fertility in gonads and gametes from adult female
offspring, while aim 2 will address similar endpoints in males. Identifying possible alterations in IVF offspring in
the reproductive system is important (1) because any procedure use to help achieve a pregnancy should
ensure a healthy child which will not develop future complications and (2) because IVF is commonly used by
infertile couples the underlying infertility conditions could passed to the offspring ultimately rendering the
offspring dependent of IVF. The plan proposed in this fellowship will prove to be useful for future studies of
complex tissues and also for identifying mechanisms influenced by IVF that could be interrogated in the future
to minimize adverse effects in offspring."

The primary goals of this K24 award are to identify and cultivate diverse, highly motivated, young investigators
with a propensity for independent thinking, and increase their involvement in collaborative, patient-oriented HIV
pathogenesis and cure research. Specifically, junior investigators will be directed engaged in innovative
methods to characterize whole-body HIV persistence and determine mechanisms of host control of HIV
infection; research will foster their academic careers. One of the major barriers to the successful design and
implementation of HIV curative strategies is the limited ability to characterize the tissue-wide burden of HIV in
the setting of ART and monitor changes in HIV reservoirs relative to a therapeutic intervention. There is also a
paucity of data of how host immune and genetic responses in these microenvironments modulate HIV
persistence or exert immune control of virus without ART. Novel methods are urgently needed to address this
fundamental gap in knowledge and to develop tools to evaluate curative strategies. The goals of this proposal
are to: (1) determine relationships between residual HIV persistence and activity, T cell trafficking, and tissue
pharmacokinetics in PWH that exhibit exceptional elite control or post-treatment control following HIV curative
therapeutic intervention, (2) determine the relationship between longitudinal tissue PK of HIV bnAbs, ART and
viral dynamics using immunoPET imaging and lymph node microdialysis in the setting of cure interventions,
and, (3) determine the impact of HIV tissue burden and residual transcriptional activity on host cell factors in
study participants enrolled in unique clinical studies and from tissue from victims of sudden death with HIV on
ART. These aims involve innovative methods, such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of the HIV
envelope-specific tracer, 89Zr-VRC01, and [18F]F-AraG, which is selectively taken up by activated T cell, and in-
situ digital spatial profile analysis of tissue microenvironments which have customized to identify multiple HIV
transcripts representing various stages of the HIV lifecycle combined with unbiased human transcriptomic
analysis and targeted proteomics. Ultimately these studies will help direct interventional studies to purge HIV
reservoirs and maintain viral immune control following cessation of ART. These aims are representative of the
principal investigator's collaborative research program combining pathogenesis-based translational and
patient-oriented research to target latent HIV reservoirs and improve immune control of residual infection.
Furthermore, they expand on individually and collaboratively funded initiatives to enable long-term mentorship
and support opportunities to junior investigators to become involved in translational HIV cure research."
10745307,"Child Maltreatment and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Examining Psychosocial and Immunological Pathways in
 a Prospective, Longitudinal Cohort
PI: Hannah M. C. Schreier
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over one third of U.S. youth are investigated for child maltreatment (CM) before the age of 18. CM represents
an especially potent early life stressor with a profound impact on youth’s psychological and physical well-being.
Among other things, CM increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is responsible for 32% of
all deaths in the U.S. and the roots of which can already be found during childhood. Thus, a better
understanding of the physiological mechanisms through which CM is associated with increased CVD risk is
needed to improve the lifelong health trajectories of youth with a CM history, a high-risk yet understudied
group, as well as to better understand biological mechanisms connecting early life adversity to later life health
more generally. The proposed project will build on the currently ongoing Child Health Study (CHS; HD089922,
PI: Noll, Co-I: Schreier), as part of which 675 youth aged 8-13 years who were recently investigated for CM as
well as 225 comparison youth without a history of CM are being recruited and followed prospectively. Taking
advantage of this unique and exceptionally well-characterized cohort, we will augment the biopsychosocial
data already being collected to examine in-depth immune function outcomes. To this end, this project will
assess stimulated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production following in vitro microbial challenge,
sensitivity to glucocorticoid signaling among white blood cells, and, finally, latent virus regulation, all across
multiple timepoints. This will allow us to investigate prospectively and in detail the associations between
exposure to CM and immune function outcomes and will be the first study to do so in a sample of recently
maltreated youth. Additionally, we will be able to link the resulting immune function outcomes to early
indicators of CVD risk among these youth, both by linking to existing measures of cardiometabolic risk in the
cohort and further by linking to youth’s administrative records, specifically Medicaid claims data. This will be
the first study to examine connections between immune function outcomes and CVD-relevant health care use
among youth. Finally, we will be investigating the extent to which malleable protective factors, including youth
lifestyle, family and peer environments, may protect youth from the adverse effects of CM on altered immune
function outcomes and the extent to which key demographic moderators (age, pubertal stage, gender,
race/ethnicity, CM severity) play a role. The interdisciplinary research team includes expertise in the
assessment of immune function outcomes and CVD risk among vulnerable youth; the recruitment and
retention of prospective cohorts of CM survivors; and the use of administrative records to answer questions
pertaining to the well-being of youth with a history of CM. Resulting data will make important contributions to
the CM and early life adversity literatures. It will also inform future prevention and intervention efforts with the
ultimate goal of reducing the risk of adverse long-term health consequences among some of the most
vulnerable individuals in the population as well as reducing the healthcare costs resulting from CM."

All eukaryotic cells, whether normal or cancerous, require the ability to sense changes in nutrients levels,
ensuring their efficient use for survival and growth. Nutrient sensing mechanisms enable cells to rapidly adapt to
environmental perturbation, a feature particularly essential for cancer cells to overcome diverse metabolic
stresses along the metastatic cascade. Although many nutrient sensing mechanisms have been described, how
metabolites are sensed in subcellular compartments remains a major open question. This question is particularly
relevant for redox-active molecules such as NAD and glutathione, which display remarkably heterogenous
distribution across subcellular compartments and have been shown to play key roles in cancer metastasis.
Recent breakthroughs in deorphanizing mitochondrial metabolite transporters provided unprecedented
opportunity to probe the dynamics and sensing mechanism of these metabolites at subcellular precision. In a
recently published study, SLC25A39 has been identified as a key transporter for mitochondrial glutathione, a
major antioxidant molecule implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. Remarkably, evidence suggests
that SLC25A39 undergoes feedback regulation by mitochondrial glutathione and may be required for efficient
metastatic colonization, implicating it in an adaptive mechanism for cancers to overcome metabolic stress during
metastasis.
This proposal seeks a deeper understanding of the implication of organellar glutathione metabolism in cancer.
The Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to understand the role of mitochondrial glutathione homeostasis in tumor
progression and metastasis and decipher the mechanism of its regulation. The Aim 2 of this proposal seeks to
develop novel genetically encoded, single-cell RNAseq-compatible reporters for profiling intercellular
heterogeneity in mitochondrial glutathione in tumors. Using a combination of biochemical analysis, unbiased
CRISPR screens and novel animal models, this proposal aims to paint a multilayered picture of the dynamics,
regulatory mechanisms and functional contribution of mitochondrial glutathione homeostasis in tumor
progression and metastasis. Completion of the proposed studies will deepen our understanding on the role of
compartmentalized metabolite pools in metabolic rewiring of cancers and shed light on novel therapeutic
strategies to target metastasis."
10763824,"Targeting PTEN to ameliorate muscular dystrophy in a mouse model
Abstract
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating and lethal disease due to degeneration and wasting of
skeletal muscles that are key for motility and respiration. Patients eventually lose ambulation and mobility, and
experience respiratory failure. Currently there is no cure for this disease. The proposed research aims to
provide basic understanding of how PTEN protein might be involved in the pathogenesis of DMD and explore a
new PTEN-targeting therapeutic strategy to treat DMD in a mouse model, the mdx mice. The applicant’s team
has recently identified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as a new regulator of myogenesis. PTEN is a
phosphatase that counteracts the growth factor-mediated signaling that is critical for muscle growth and repair
through activation of muscle stem cells (also called muscle satellite cells, MuSCs). Interestingly, we and others
found that PTEN levels are very low in healthy adult muscles but elevated in skeletal muscles of DMD patients
and animal models, suggesting that PTEN upregulation may contribute to disease progression. To confirm this,
we show in preliminary studies that muscle-specific knockout of Pten gene ameliorates muscle pathology and
restores muscle function in mdx mice. These exciting results confirm that inhibition of PTEN may be translated
to treat DMD in humans. However, targeting PTEN and its signaling requires a thorough understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying PTEN function in dystrophic muscle, which will be investigated
in the first part of the proposed study. To further explore the translatability of this discovery, we tested in
preliminary studies the effect of a pharmacological inhibitor of PTEN (namely VO-OHpic) in mdx mice. We
showed that VO-OHpic robustly improves muscle health and function without obvious side effects. To further
improve the safety of VO-OHpic in vivo, we generated a nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery system with
which to deliver VO-OHpic specifically to muscle cells to achieve sustained drug release and limit side effects.
In the second part of the proposed research, we will further optimize this prototype drug delivery system and
examine its utility and safety in mdx mice. Upon completion of the study, we will have not only gained
imperative insights into the pathological function of PTEN in dystrophic muscle, but also developed a novel
drug delivery system for sustained pharmacological inhibition of PTEN specifically in the muscle to ameliorate
muscle pathology and improve muscle function in a preclinical animal model. These results will establish a
solid foundation for clinical translation of this promising therapeutic strategy to treat DMD in humans. The
muscle-targeting NP drug delivery system may also be adapted to deliver other therapeutics to treat DMD or
other degenerative diseases."

 It is increasingly recognized that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent liver disease with
complex and heterogenous underlying causes. Now, new evidence suggests that dysregulated hepatic sulfur
amino acid metabolism is associated with advanced human NASH and causes markedly worsened steatosis
and injury in genetic mouse models. However, significant knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of how
sulfur amino acid metabolism modifies NASH severity, and what mechanisms control hepatic sulfur amino acid
metabolism in normal physiology and liver diseases. This proposal builds on our discovery that CoA
metabolism is a key missing link between impaired hepatic sulfur amino acid metabolism and liver fat
accumulation and injury in NASH. We aim to establish a novel pathogenic mechanism whereby hepatic
availability of cysteine (a CoA synthesis substrate) is critical in maintaining the mitochondrial CoA pool to
support fatty acid oxidation. However, dysregulated sulfur amino acid flux in advanced NAFLD reduces
cysteine availability that impairs CoA synthesis. Hepatic CoA insufficiency in turn limits the liver’s ability to
adapt to increased fatty acid influx, creating a condition termed metabolic inflexibility that promotes
mitochondrial dysfunction, steatosis and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, we have identified that impaired
methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A), which drives upstream methionine cycle-transsulfuration flux to
produce cysteine, and overactivation of cysteine dioxygenase type-1 (CDO1), which mediates downstream
cysteine elimination, contribute to such pathogenic condition by causing imbalanced cysteine input and output
in NAFLD. Further study revealed intriguing crosstalk of bile acids, TFEB, and FGF15/19 signaling regulation
of MAT1A and CDO1 to control hepatic sulfur amino acid and CoA metabolism under normal physiology and
NASH. We have developed novel mouse models that allow us to manipulate hepatic sulfur amino acid flux at
the two key regulatory steps (MAT1A, CDO1). In Aim 1, we will use hepatocyte-specific inducible CDO1
transgenic mice and hepatocyte-specific CDO1 knockout mice to study how altered CDO1 expression
downstream of bile acid signaling impacts hepatic sulfur amino acid, CoA and GSH metabolism to modulate
NASH severity. In Aim 2, we will use liver specific MAT1A gain-of-function and loss-of-function mouse models
to establish the significance of the MAT1A in regulating hepatic sulfur amino acid, CoA and GSH metabolism,
and further investigate how FGF15/19 and TFEB regulate MAT1A-driven sulfur flux and CoA metabolism in
physiology and NASH. By defining a new pathogenic link of sulfur amino acid metabolism to CoA metabolism
and delineating novel mechanisms regulating hepatic sulfur amino acid and CoA metabolism, we expect that
this study may advance the field by providing not only new insights into the mechanisms driving NASH
progression but also molecular basis for developing future therapeutic interventions."
10763827,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Tregs and MDSCs have emerged as key suppressor cells that inhibit effector immunity in the TB granuloma.
In addition, Tregs have been implicated in the maintenance of HIV latency. We have generated two selective
biologic agents for potent depletion of Tregs and and MDSCs using diphtheria toxin (DT) fusion protein
technology: DT-IL2 targets IL2-R-positive (CD25+) cells (Tregs), and DT-IL4 targets IL4-R positive (CD124+)
cells (MDSCs). Our preliminary data demonstrate that: (i) DT-IL2 and DT-IL4 reduce the abundance of Treg and
MDSC cells, respectively, in mouse lungs and spleens, (ii) DT-IL2 and DT-IL4 reduces the ability of M. tb to
proliferate in an acute murine TB infection model, (iii) the drug, tasquinimod which has potent anti-MDSC activity,
reduced the ability of M. tb to proliferate in an acute TB infection model with a concomitant reduction in MDSCs,
and (iv) administration of DT-IL2 to CD4+ T cells from patients with controlled HIV reactivates viral replication.
These data support the hypotheses that (1) Tregs and MDSCs play important inhibitory roles in M. tb
containment, and (2) that Treg cells play a role in HIV latency maintenance. A central scientific premise of this
application is that further definition of the immunosuppressive roles of Tregs and MDSCs in TB and HIV infection
will reveal important immunopathogenesis mechanisms that may be exploited towards developing improved
host-directed therapies (HDTs) for both diseases. In this proposal we seek to address this premise by pursuing
the following aims. Aim 1: define the role of Treg cells in the TB granuloma using targeted CD25+ cell depletion
with DT-IL2. We will (a) evaluate the cellular composition of both cellular (C57BL/6, WT which are sst1R) and
necrotic (C57BL/6 sst1S) murine granulomas with and without CD25+ cell depletion using single-cell RNA-Seq
(SSRS) as well as traditional methods, (b) evaluate the efficacy of targeted CD25+ cell depletion in chronic
murine TB with and without anti-TB drug therapy, and (c) evaluate the contribution of Treg cells to the process
of cavitation (granuloma breakdown) using a novel model of rabbit cavitary TB. Aim 2: define the role of
MDSCs in the TB granuloma using targeted CD124+ cell depletion with DT-IL4. We will (a) evaluate the cellular
composition of both cellular and necrotic murine granulomas with and without CD124+ cell depletion using SSRS
as well as traditional methods, (b) evaluate the efficacy of targeted CD124+ cell depletion in chronic murine TB
with and without anti-TB drug therapy, (c) assess the impact of dual CD25+ and CD124+ cell depletion in the TB
granuloma with B6 sst1R and sst1S mice using SSRS as well as traditional methods, and (d) evaluate the
efficacy of dual CD25+ and CD124+ cell depletion in chronic murine TB with and without anti-TB drug therapy.
Aim 3: conduct translational applications of CD25+ cell depletion with (i) BCG vaccination and (ii) HIV
reactivation. We will (a) evaluate the efficacy of targeted CD25+ cell depletion as a vaccine adjuvant prior to
BCG vaccination and (b) evaluate the impact of targeted CD25+ cell depletion on HIV reactivation in PBMCs
from patients with controlled HIV infection."
10763829,"ABSTRACT
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common rheumatic disease, affects 1.5 million people in the United
States and can lead to debilitating joint pain, functional limitations, and premature mortality. Existing treatment
approaches based on immunosuppressive medications reduce disease severity but often fail to adequately
control symptoms and can lead to severe adverse side effects. This proposal addresses the critical unmet need
for non-pharmacologic strategies to augment medical management of RA, improve long-term clinical outcomes,
and reduce disease-related symptoms.
 Psychological stress is postulated to exacerbate disease severity in autoimmune diseases, but few studies
have prospectively examined its impact on disease activity in RA patients or the therapeutic potential of
interventions that improve stress resilience in this patient group. Furthermore, while mindfulness-based
interventions (MBIs), including the mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR), have been shown to
reduce psychological stress and pain in several chronic diseases, it remains unknown whether they represent
an effective adjunctive approach for improving disease outcomes in RA. To address these significant knowledge
gaps, I propose to examine the effects of stress, stress-buffering factors, and MBIs on risk of disease flares and
symptom severity in RA and related autoimmune conditions.
 I will first identify mechanistic targets for mind-body interventions in RA by building on an actively enrolling
RO1-funded longitudinal cohort study of RA patients. Aim 1 will determine whether greater negative
psychological stress independently associates with increased risk of worse RA disease activity and symptom
severity over time. I will further test whether stress resilience and mindfulness longitudinally correlate with better
outcomes—including less severe disease activity and symptoms—to identify key targets for non-pharmacologic
interventions in this patient group. In Aim 2 I will develop augmentations to the mindfulness-based stress
reduction (MBSR) course for people with inflammatory arthritis, and conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility
and acceptability of an MBSR trial for improving disease outcomes in RA.
 This will be the first longitudinal study to examine the effects of psychological stress and stress resilience
on RA disease activity. Further, this study will advance the field of integrative rheumatology by developing
innovate methods to augment MBSR for people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The proposed
study will generate proof-of-concept data to inform a subsequent randomized controlled trial with R-level
funding to test whether MBSR improves RA disease activity and symptoms. Importantly, this K23 Career
Development Award will catalyze my successful transition to an independent physician-scientist with an
impactful research program defining mechanisms and efficacy of MBIs in people with rheumatic conditions."
10763830,"Project Summary: The TGF- superfamily, which includes BMPs and activins, represents a diverse collection
of signaling ligands that have profound control over numerous biological processes. Typically, ligands are
disulfide-bonded dimers with a propeller-like shape. They signal by forming a ternary complex with two type I
and two type II receptor, which activates downstream signaling events. This assembly is mediated by a number
of extracellular protein modulators which directly bind to the ligands to impact their interaction with the cellular
receptors. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography and binding analysis coupled with in vitro cellular assays,
the objective of our laboratory is to define the molecular mechanisms of ligand-receptor interactions incorporated
to differentiate signaling. Furthermore, our laboratory is characterizing the interactions of extracellular
antagonists, which neutralize ligands by blocking ligand-receptors interactions. Similarly, we aim to understand
how the N-terminal prodomain of certain ligands renders the growth factor latent and are focused on deciphering
the molecular mechanisms of activation. In addition, recent research has shown that heterodimeric ligands can
form and are biologically relevant in certain cases, even more so than the homodimeric versions. Thus, the
laboratory is investigating the structure, function and synthesis of ligand heterodimers. In a disparate project, we
are characterizing the structure and function of apolipoproteins – with the intent to understand how they transition
from a lipid free state to a lipid bound state in the biogenesis of lipoprotein particles."

Current estimates are that 57% of persons in the U.S. with HIV are suppressed, leaving 43% unsuppressed,
including about 13% who are undiagnosed and 30% who have been diagnosed but are not currently
suppressed. Identifying persons with unsuppressed HIV to link them to care and antiretroviral treatment (ART)
is critical for improving health and reducing new infections. New epidemiologic tools that identify in real time
communities with high amounts of circulating HIV may enhance efforts to reduce HIV transmission and
substantially contribute to ending the HIV epidemic. During the SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) pandemic, we and others
used “wastewater environmental virology” to monitor and respond to COVID. It uses viral capture and PCR
detection of viral nucleic acid from wastewater collection sites to detect, quantify, and predict total SCV2
activity in time. We built a robust and mature wastewater sampling program for the Houston region that
includes weekly assessment of 39 wastewater collection sites covering about 4 million residents. Our recent
preliminary data demonstrate that HIV is detected in wastewater. Wastewater testing is unbiased,
comprehensive, real-time, quantitative, and not influenced by access to health care, stigma or denial. We
hypothesize that our pioneering wastewater sampling program can be applied as a powerful new tool to
identify geographic areas with a high active burden of HIV, reflecting substantial numbers of people with
undiagnosed or untreated HIV infection. Resources can then be mobilized to these communities to enhance
HIV outreach, testing, prevention and linkage to care. The specifics aims are: 1) To develop a sensitive,
reproducible, and streamlined wastewater HIV detection pipeline; 2) To develop epidemiologic models
incorporating data from wastewater sampling as a novel and informative parameter along with routine
surveillance data on HIV diagnoses and population data; 3) To characterize and incorporate stakeholder
preferences, priorities, and recommendations for engaging key community stakeholders in the HIV wastewater
sampling program with consideration to the ethical, legal, social, and cultural contexts of individuals living in
target neighborhoods; 4) To determine if delivering proven public health interventions to neighborhoods as
directed by wastewater data can reduce the wastewater viral load and increase HIV diagnoses in those
neighborhoods. This research will enhance the Respond pillar of the End the HIV Epidemic (EHE) strategy. It
will leverage and strengthen partnerships between the researchers and the Houston Health Department, the
regional public health authority overseeing many EHE programs in Houston. The work in Houston, a high
priority EHE region, will result in: (i) the US’s only HIV wastewater sampling program, (ii) epidemiologic models
enhanced with wastewater data that identify unmet testing and treatment needs, (iii) community-informed and
ethically appropriate, real-time public health monitoring that reduces the number of people with unsuppressed
HIV, and (iv) tools and expertise that can be disseminated to other areas."

10764225,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Data Management and Analysis Core: Aikseng Ooi and Nirav Merchant) 
The University of Arizona Superfund Research Program (UA SRP) will generate volumes and types of data that 
are not manageable in traditional laboratory settings. The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will 
function as the primary service for UA SRP into large biological, geophysical, and chemical datasets, including 
but not limited to RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, exome sequencing, 
metabolomics, metagenomics, microbiome amplicon sequencing, geospatial positioning, analytical chemistry, 
and imaging. DMAC enables investigators by performing three core functions: (1) DMAC will lead the housing 
of all data in an easy-to-access data repository system: CyVerse. Cyverse is a computational infrastructure 
consisting of hardware, software, and personnel that are designed to handle huge datasets and complex 
analyses, and is maintained at the University of Arizona. DMAC will utilize a reference implementation (RI) that 
divides data into five different levels for easy data sharing, processing, and analyzing. Lowest levels (level 1) 
will be raw data, while higher levels (level 5) will be file formats utilizable in graphics visualizations. DMAC will 
support these processes with help from on-staff statisticians and bioinformaticians who can devise analysis 
strategies for individual investigators. In addition to data storage, DMAC will orchestrate sample management 
using Fulcrum software. Fulcrum allows barcoding, global positioning, and annotation of biological samples in 
an easy-to-use application available on both traditional workstations and mobile platforms. Fulcrum is critical for 
point-of-generation sample tracking due to its mobility. (2) Beyond data and sample management, DMAC will 
perform both standard and custom computational analyses of the data. This will include DMAC-lead 
investigations into “feature signatures”, which address the predictability of data across UA SRP projects; for 
example, can the gene expression changes associated with a particular arsenic treatment predict metagenomics 
changes in a similarly treated sample? In conjunction with UA SRP investigators, DMAC will apply traditional 
algorithms, or develop novel algorithms as needed, to identify signatures for the different data types collected. 
(3) The storage and analytical capabilities of DMAC will be integrated into a user-friendly web application that 
allows individual investigators to retrieve, manipulate, and visualize UA SRP data. The web application will be 
implemented using an in-house maintained server in conjunction with the R statistical environment. DMAC is 
thus an integral component of the UA SRP proposal that utilizes state-of-the-art technologies to enable the 
discovery of novel insights into arsenic exposure and its role in health and disease."
10768607,"Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer in American males and
is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths of men in North America after lung cancer (1). In 2019,
approximately 174,650 men were diagnosed with CaP and nearly 31,620 men will die from the disease. While
the overall cancer incidence among men in the U.S. Veterans Affairs Health Care System mirrored the general
population, it is important to understand that the U.S has an aging veteran population, and the risk of developing
CaP increases with age. Furthermore, veterans who were exposed to herbicides, such as Agent Orange, are at
increased risk of CaP. The first line of therapy for CaP is surgery or radiation, and the survival rate for patients
diagnosed with early stage CaP is excellent (~95%). However, the prognosis for men diagnosed with advanced
CaP is poor' with a five-year survival less than 30%. The major therapy for advanced CaP is androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT). When the disease progresses after ADT, a stage referred to as castration resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) ensues. Efforts to develop new drugs for the treatment of CRPC have been hampered either by
rapid hepatic metabolism of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) or dose limiting cytotoxicity (docetaxel and
doxorubicin). To overcome this, innovative pharmaceutical solutions are needed to effectively deliver the drugs
specifically to the tumor site while minimizing systemic administration of frequent and high doses of toxic
chemotherapy. The enhanced, targeted, intracellular co-delivery of drug and gene therapy with novel
nanocarriers composed of biocompatible and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) is a goal of this
proposal. PLGA is safe and highly effective in the targeted delivery of hydrophobic drugs such as docetaxel
(Doc) to specific tumors, demonstrating enhanced therapeutic activity at lower doses than when administered
alone. Active targeting, as opposed to passive targeting adds value to tumor specific-treatment. This targeting
strategy is based on the molecular recognition of tumor biomarkers which are over-expressed on cancer cells,
via specific vector molecules conjugated to the surface of the drug carrier. These vector molecules dictate the
carrier's biodistribution and its affinity for the desired site of action. Our long-term goal is the development of a
targeted hierarchical nanoparticle (HNP for the co-delivery of chemo- and gene therapies for CaP, which can
overcome the limitation in systemic delivery of currently available drugs. As proof-of-principle, we will use Doc,
a promoter and stabilizer of microtubule assembly, that shows excellent efficacy in vitro but which is rapidly
metabolized in the liver plus a gene-silencing agent together in our HNP. Our rationale that Doc can be targeted
specifically to prostate tumors in pre-clinical animal models will provide the impetus to encapsulate other
therapeutics (such as cabazitaxel and paclitaxel) that have dose-limiting toxicities to improve response to drug
therapies while reducing toxic side effects. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To optimize the synthesis of a PSMA-
targeted PTCS-HNP for delivery of IL-8 siRNA and Doc to CaP cells and assess the IC50 of different PTCS-
HNPs; Aim 2: Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PTCS-HNP in CaP cell
lines; Aim 3: To assess the effects of PTCS-HNPs on primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination of
CaP cells grown as xenografts in an orthotopic, preclinical model of human CaP. Upon conclusion of this project,
we will produce a highly effective, targeted drug and gene therapy NP delivery system for the treatment of
advanced CaP. The proposed research is innovative because of the exclusive chemical synthesis of our unique,
multifunctional HNP, the two-hit nature of the chemo- and gene therapy and its targeted specificity for CaP. The
tunable nature of our HNP will allow its application for the delivery of a host of different therapies to a wide range
of tumors. Lastly, the incorporation of imaging agents into our HNP will yield a truly theranostic approach for the
treatment of different cancers especially advanced CaP."

differentiation and function is a prerequisite for formulating more efficacious vaccines.
 In response to infection or immunization, activated CD4+ T cells undergo stage-wise differentiation to
become functionally competent TFH cells. These stages include early stage TFH lineage specification to
generate nascent TFH cells, GC response stage to mature to GC-TFH cells, and later stage formation of memory
TFH cells. Vaccines are delivered as live-attenuated viruses, inactivated organisms, or protein subcomponents
via different routes. It has not drawn enough attention whether all TFH cells are created equal by different
vaccination approaches.
 We extended our in vivo studies to CD28 and ICOS costimulatory receptors, which are well-established
TFH regulators. CD28-PYAP and ICOS-YMFM intracellular motifs are preferentially connected to PKCq/PDK1
and PI3K-Akt pathways, respectively. Current views hold that CD28 is critical for initiating and ICOS for
sustaining TFH responses. Contrary to this belief, our preliminary data revealed that the ICOS-YMFM motif is
essential for initiating Imm_TFH, while the CD28-PYAP motif was indispensable for sustaining Inf_TFH
responses. These findings led to our central hypothesis that TFH cells have distinct molecular
requirements depending on activating agents/approaches, where CD28 and ICOS motifs differentially
regulate Inf_TFH and Imm_TFH cells in a stage-specific manner. To test this, we designed multi-layered
functional and molecular studies in 3 specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. To define differential requirements for CD28 and ICOS motifs in TFH fate specification.
Specific Aim 2. To delineate CD28 and ICOS motif-controlled molecular circuits that promote GC-TFH
 cell maturation and B-cell help function.
Specific Aim 3. To investigate the roles of CD28 and ICOS motifs in memory TFH persistence and recall
response.
 Developing efficacious vaccines against infectious diseases is thus essential for protecting troops in
service as well as veterans. Our proposed study directly addresses this need, by advancing the understanding
of TFH cells at new frontiers. We expect to yield essential information on tailoring TFH activity to provide optimal
B cell help, and hence provide paradigm-shifting rationales for enhancing vaccine design."

Approximately 65% of Veterans report pain in the last 3 months, and >50% of Veterans receiving care at VHA
facilities report chronic pain. Chronic pain syndromes are more common among female veterans, and adults
under age 24 comprise ~10% of the U.S. military, but little is known about differences in neurobiological
mediators of chronic pain that starts in adolescence versus adulthood. The first-line treatment approach for
chronic pain over the last few decades has been opioid drugs, but this approach has created a major health
crisis defined by high rates of prescription opioid abuse, high rates of opioid use disorder in pain patients, high
rates of recreational opioid users starting with prescription opioids, and high rates of opioid-related deaths.
Here, we propose experiments that test melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) as a target for treatment of chronic
inflammatory pain. MC4Rs are widely distributed in CNS, with endogenous agonist (alpha-melanocyte-
stimulating hormone) and endogenous antagonist (agouti-related protein) ligands. MC4R and its ligands are
expressed in ascending and descending pain pathways, including in central amygdala (CeA) and
periaqueductal gray (PAG). The ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) receives dense CeA input and feeds into
descending pain modulation circuits. Prior work by our lab and others showed that central MC4R blockade has
anti-pain effects of its own, and also that it potentiates the analgesic effects of acute morphine, blocks the
development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of chronic morphine, and blocks morphine withdrawal-
induced hyperalgesia.
Here, our overarching hypothesis is that brain MC4Rs are a promising novel non-opioid target for reducing
nociception in individuals living with chronic inflammatory pain. We will test this hypothesis in complementary
aims that use convergent techniques to 1) examine the neurobiological effects of chronic inflammatory pain
that starts during adulthood or adolescence in males and females, and 2) test the effect of intranasally
delivered MC4R antagonist on chronic inflammatory pain. Specific Aim 1 will test the prediction that chronic
inflammatory pain produces age-specific changes in nociception and pain avoidance, CeA MC4R expression
and CeA-vlPAG circuit activity in adolescent and adult male and female rats. Specific Aim 2 will test the
prediction that intra-CeA MC4R antagonism and CeA-vlPAG circuit stimulation rescue inflammatory
hyperalgesia and pain avoidance in adolescent and adult male and female rats. Specific Aim 3 will test the
predictions that intra-nasal MC4R antagonism rescues inflammatory hyperalgesia and enhances morphine
anti-hyperalgesic effects."

10768764,"Abstract
This is a proposal for a new, multi-PI grant involving two senior investigators with complementary
expertise to study an essential but poorly understood step in human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV
is responsible for approximately 5% of human cancer worldwide. During infection, HPV is internalized to
the endosome from where it is targeted to the retrograde pathway for transport to the TGN en route to
the nucleus for productive infection. Endosome-to-Golgi targeting represents the committed infection
step and remains poorly understood. Our published and unpublished results suggest that a host factor –
the transmembrane protease γ-secretase – is endowed with a novel chaperone activity that promotes
insertion of an HPV capsid protein called L2 into the endosome membrane. Membrane insertion of L2
and subsequent protrusion into the cytoplasm recruits cytosolic host components that deliver HPV to the
Golgi. Strikingly, we also found that HPV infection stabilizes the multi-subunit γ-secretase complex.
Accordingly, the central objectives of this proposal are to elucidate, at the molecular level, how γ-
secretase promotes membrane insertion of L2 and how HPV regulates the function of γ-secretase to
coordinately promote HPV infection. We will identify cellular proteins that recruit γ-secretase to HPV,
determine if γ-secretase-mediated capsid rearrangements allow L2 to emerge from the capsid, and
attempt to reconstitute membrane insertion in vitro and determine the relevant γ-secretase subunits and
activities. We will determine if γ-secretase plays a role in insertion of cell-penetrating peptides or
retrograde trafficking in general. We will examine the role of the N-terminal transmembrane domain in L2
in these activities and attempt to develop viral mutants that are independent of γ-secretase. Finally, we
will determine how HPV infection stabilizes the γ-secretase complex, identify other factors involved in this
process, and determine if the L2 transmembrane domain is sufficient for stabilization and membrane
insertion. Taken together, these experiments will shed new light on the unusual role of γ-secretase in
HPV entry, improve our understanding of this crucial step in HPV infection, elucidate new aspects of
general cell biology, and possibly point the way to new therapeutic approaches to prevent infection by
these important human pathogens."
10768924,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall objective of Project 3 is to discover and exploit tumor cell extrinsic mechanisms of therapy resistance
by focusing on the contribution and targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) created
by the synergism between tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and
neuroblastoma (NB) cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that TAM, CAF, and NB cells synergistically
create an environment that enhances the ability of NB cells to escape targeted, cytotoxic, and immune
therapies and that TGFβ-dependent and -independent pathways play prominent roles in promoting
Adrenergic to Mesenchymal transition (AMT), producing a fibrotic ECM, and suppressing T and NK
(Natural Killer) cells cytotoxic activities. We postulate that the TME is altered in its composition and function
as tumors are treated and become increasingly rich in TAM and CAF leading to an inflammatory environment
that suppress T and NK cell cytotoxic activities and leads to therapy resistance. This hypothesis is based on
published and preliminary data demonstrating that TAM and CAF are enriched in NB tumors post-therapy, and
at relapse. We have evidence that TAM and CAF synergistically activate in NB cells NFkB and the production of
IL-6 in a TGFb-dependent mechanism and STAT3 by a TGFb and IL-6-independent mechanism. The activation
of these two pathways induces AMT and drug-resistance. We also demonstrate that therapies with B7H3
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells can target B7H3-expressing TAM and have engineered TGFb resistant
CAR T-cells. Aim 1, will determine the TME-dependent mechanisms of AMT and therapy resistance
focusing on how TGFβ-dependent and -independent pathways promote AMT, resistance to chemotherapy and
targeted therapies (with Project 1), and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo (with Project 2). We will
examine how the ECM stimulated by TGFβ1 contributes to AMT and to NB cell migration and motility. Last, we
will characterize the heterogeneous composition of the TME in serial human tumors with attention to spatial-
temporal arrangements and identification of distinct TAM, CAF, NB subpopulations, ECM proteins, and activated
pathways. The results of which will inform a clinically applicable multiplex immunofluorescence assay for
inclusion in NANT trials. Aim 2 will translate these discoveries in pre-clinical tumor models by targeting
TME-dependent pathways to inhibit AMT and enhance therapy response. We will test the therapeutic
efficacy of TGFβ and JAK/STAT3 inhibition in combination with chemoimmunotherapy or including CAR T-cells
using human NB lines and patient-derived xenotransplants in immunodeficient mice. We will assess the efficacy
of TGFb-resistant B7H3-CAR T- in pre-clinical TME-dependent AMT in vitro and in vivo models (with Project
4). The most effective agent(s) will then be proposed for early phase clinical trials to the NANT (Core B). Thus
Project 3 brings a unique contribution to the overall objective of this PPG through its focus on the TME and on
non-autonomous mechanisms mediating therapy resistance and immune escape."
10768925,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the only pediatric solid tumor for which immunotherapy has become part of the standard
of care, with FDA approval of two anti-GD2 antibodies. Immunotherapy with anti-GD2 is utilized both during
upfront therapy and for patients who have relapsed. Despite the availability of these important drugs,
approximately 50% of NB patients relapse and eventually die from their disease. Those patients who survive are
left with debilitating long-term effects, including growth retardation, hearing loss, infertility, and even secondary
malignancies. Many of these secondary effects derive from high dose chemotherapy, while immunotherapy
carries a much lower risk of long-term effects. Thus, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for NB could
potentially cure more patients while causing fewer debilitating late effects in survivors. This proposal pairs
expertise in both antibody and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy with biological insights
into immunotherapy target biology and expression. Our broad hypothesis is that heterogeneous and low surface
antigen density of GD2 and other targets can limit the efficacy of immunotherapies in NB, but that this can be
overcome through therapeutic maneuvers that increase their expression and/or modulate immune cell function.
CARs are synthetic receptors that redirect the specificity of a T cell against a surface molecule expressed on
tumor cells. Our laboratories have defined the antigen density threshold for CAR T cell activity, and have
demonstrated that low level expression of target antigens can drive resistance to these immunotherapies. We
have successfully reengineered CARs to lower their activation threshold and enhance CAR T cell activity at low
antigen density. We have also focused on enhancing antibody based immunotherapies in NB focusing on
clinically validated anti-GD2 antibodies. We recently discovered that NB cells can lower the density of GD2 on
their surface, avoiding immune cell killing. We uncovered the mechanism of GD2 regulation in NB, linked GD2
expression epigenetic cell state, and reversed GD2 downregulation with FDA approved drugs. The work
proposed in this renewal application will address the challenges of low target antigen expression to enhance the
efficacy of immunotherapies in NB. We will test our central hypothesis in three Specific Aims: 1) Define and
modulate the GD2 antigen density threshold necessary for therapeutic success of anti-GD2 based
immunotherapies; 2) Optimize approaches to deliver CAR T cells in combination with EZH2 inhibitors to
overcome antigen negative/low resistance; 3) Engineer GD2 and B7-H3 CAR T cells to overcome low target
antigen density in NB by utilizing two novel platforms alone or in combination. This project is significant because
it will result in new immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of children with NB, while also uncovering
fundamental mechanisms driving successful immunotherapies that can be broadly applied across many types
of cancer. This Project will address a major unmet need for new and effective therapies for children with NB that
can cure more patients and reduce the burden of debilitating late effects."
10775783,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The recent discovery of a putative attention control area shows that there is a fundamental gap in our
understanding of the neural mechanisms of attentional control. The existence of this conceptual gap constitutes
an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to explain a key cognitive function, the flexible
selection of information according to current demands and interests, nor to appropriately treat impairments of
attention. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how sensory processing and cognitive control
mechanisms interact to generate intelligent behavior. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination
of the functional organization of the neural circuits supporting attentional control and the mechanisms they are
implementing to achieve this function. The experimental model utilizes brain-wide imaging of functional
specializations for attention followed by the targeted determination of local neural processes. It allows to test the
central hypothesis that there is at least one area in the temporal lobe that is critical for the endogenous control
of visual attention. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the research will re-define endogenous
attentional control circuits, which is of direct relevance to neurological practice. The central hypothesis will be
tested through four specific aims: Aim1 will determine, using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and targeted single-unit electrophysiology, the functional specializations of visual attentional control areas
and test the working hypothesis that endogenous attention is controlled by specific set of areas sharing a similar
organization across species. Aim 2 will determine population codes and dynamics controlling attention and test
the working hypothesis that a temporal and a parietal area control the focus of attention in similar ways, yet with
differential coupling to its expression into action. Aim 3 will determine the network structure of attentional control
areas and test the working hypothesis that the three regions of attentional control are selectively interconnected
to form an integrated network of attentional control. Aim 4 will determine the neural mechanisms of visual
attentional control over sensory areas and behavior through artificial activation and inactivation during attentive
visual processing and test the working hypothesis that a recently discovered temporal lobe area exerts
attentional control. The approach is innovative, because it challenges long-held views on the neural circuits of
attention and because it introduces a new multi-modal experimental paradigm that promises to shift the approach
to neural systems analysis in the cognitive neurosciences. The proposed research is significant, because
discovery and characterization of a new attentional control area will fundamentally alter current concepts of
attention and brain organization, and because it overcomes a critical barrier in the cognitive neurosciences, the
difficulty to bridge between large-scale investigations of functional brain organization with the determination of
local neural mechanisms. The project is of direct relevance to neurology and is expected to have a positive
impact on the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of attentional control deficits like hemispatial neglect."

Project Summary
Every year, more than 100 Americans a day die after overdosing on opiates. Addiction to opioids, including
prescription drug such as oxycodone, and illicit drugs such a s heroin and fentanyl, is a national crisis that
affects public health and the economy. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop better treatments for opiate
addiction, which requires a better understanding of its biological basis. The primary goal of our proposal is to
identify cell types and cell type-specific gene expression patterns associated with higher vulnerability to
compulsive oxycodone use in an unbiased and quantitative way. We will accomplish this goal by implementing
single-cell sequencing assays to measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility in thousands of
individual cells in a single experiment. We will use brains of N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats that have
undergone the extended access to oxycodone self-administration procedure. We focus on HS rats because
they are genetically diverse and exhibit an exceptional behavioral repertoire. These rats are characterized as
vulnerable or resistant to oxycodone compulsive intake based on advanced analysis of addiction-like
behavioral traits, including tolerance, dependence, motivation, and compulsive drug intake. This behavioral
paradigm recapitulates many of the key neuroadaptations observed in human addiction and has high face,
predictive, and construct validity for oxycodone use disorders. This project takes advantage of a brain tissue
repository of HS rats that have been genotyped and characterized as vulnerable and resistant to compulsive
oxycodone use. The oxycodone biobank (www.OxycodoneBioBank.org) will provide the samples to be used in
this project. We will focus on the nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in the transition from moderate to
excessive drug use. Our preliminary studies on single-cell analysis of the cerebral cortex provide a compelling
strategy to study the biological basis of opiate addiction. We propose: 1) to use single-cell RNA-seq to identify
gene expression changes in brains of HS rats that are characterized as prone or resistant to oxycodone
compulsive use (Specific Aim 1); 2) to use single-cell ATAC-seq to identify changes in chromatin accessibility
and transcription factors binding sites in the same population of HS rats (Specific Aim 2); 3) to use H3K27Ac-
PLAC-seq to link distal regulatory elements to target genes involved in oxycodone addiction-related behaviors
(Specific Aim 3). This project will benefit from multiple expertise and will leverage existing resources, including
those provided by the oxycodone biobank (U01DA044451) and the NIDA center for GWAS in outbred rats
(P50DA037844). We believe that the proposed studies have the potential to lead to groundbreaking
discoveries in the mechanistic bases of opioids addiction. The integrative analysis of our sequencing datasets
will provide considerable new insights concerning the contribution of distinct cell-types to molecular changes
associated with addiction related phenotypes.

The GI tract hosts as many neurons (enteric-associated neurons, EANs) as the spinal cord and more immune
cells than all other compartments together. Bidirectional interactions between immune and neuronal cells have
been documented during steady state and are proposed to be part of several disease processes, ranging from
multiple sclerosis to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and food allergy. With complementary expertise using
orthogonal approaches, our individual groups within this program and collaboration between our labs have
substantially contributed to the neuroimmune field by uncovering sensing mechanisms from the immune and
nervous systems that monitor perturbations at the luminal surface. In Project 3, we will investigate whether
physical interactions between enteric neurons, immune cells, and enteroendocrine cells (EEC) play major roles
in sensitization to food antigen (sensitization phase) or during allergic response (effector phase), dictating the
severity of food allergy. The experiments proposed here will complement Project 1 by defining cellular partners
in the gut epithelium, including EEC-neurons and EEC-immune cells, at different phases of allergic responses.
Project 3 will also complement studies performed by the Liberles lab in Project 2 by defining functional changes
in local enteric neurons and epithelial cells contacting vagal sensory neurons. In Aim 1, we will define
transcriptional changes in enteric neurons following allergic sensitization in mice (with Bioinformatics Core). We
will also characterize morphological or structural changes in enteric neurons during allergic responses utilizing
3D-tissue clearing imaging tools (interface with Project 1). In Aims 2&3, we will take advantage of uLIPSTIC,
recently developed in collaboration with G. Victora (Rockefeller). This new mouse genetic approach allows for
contact-dependent labeling of cell-cell interactions in specific cell types. To identify epithelial-neuron-immune
partners, we will use neuronal uLIPSTIC, allowing in vivo labeling of non-neuronal cells via neuronal-restricted
sortase expression upon cell-cell contact. Using a combination of imaging and gene-reporter mouse strains, we
will define whether neuron-immune cell interactions change spatially under allergic versus non-allergic
conditions. Finally, we will use genetically engineered mouse strains and AAV constructs using our Transgenic
Core to target or modulate specific immune or neuronal pathways in the context of allergic sensitization (interface
with Projects 1 and 2). In Aim 3, we will identify EEC-interacting partners during physiology, allergic sensitization
and effector phases, in collaboration with the Liberles lab. We will use mouse strains restricting LIPSTIC sortase
expression to EECs in the small and large intestine. With the Bioinformatics and Transgenic Cores, we will
transcriptionally profile FACS-sorted LIPSTIC labelled and unlabeled cells during steady state or food allergy,
characterizing the changes in cell dynamics in the gut epithelium taking place during allergy. To determine the
significance of the interactions identified by uLIPSTIC, we will use genetic tools both in vivo and in vitro (using
intestinal organoids) to disrupt these interactions, and then assay EEC function (interface with Projects 1 and 2)."

Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer, reflected by the fact that its
incidence has significantly fallen in most of the developed world over the past 30 years, largely due to effective
screening and treatment programs. In developing countries and also in socio-economic disadvantaged areas
of developed countries, many women lack convenient access to affordable and high-quality programs to save
their lives. Currently, more than a million women worldwide have cervical cancer. Most of these women do not
have access to diagnoses and treatments that could cure them or prolong their lives. In 2012, >500,000 new
cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed worldwide, and >250,000 of these women died of the disease --
nearly 90% in low- to middle-income countries. Deaths due to cervical cancer are projected to rise by almost
25% over the next 10 years without proper interventions. New technological developments offer the potential to
make comprehensive cervical cancer care feasible and affordable in low- and middle-income countries, and to
mitigate the skyrocketing healthcare costs in the developed world. In response, we have recently developed
(through support from an NSF-SBIR and NIH-SBIR award) a portable, low-cost, simple-to-use, telemedicine-
and patient-friendly innovative imaging system that can help advance toward the screen-and-treat strategy for
cervical cancer prevention advocated by the World Health Organization. In this phase II study, we will establish

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are monogenic disorders of the immune system. PIDs affect 1 in 780
hospitalized children. Incomplete penetrance of PIDs is common and remains largely unexplained. Herein I
hypothesize that incomplete penetrance in PIDs may also be explained by monoallelic expression (MAE).
Traditionally, transcription of autosomal genes is thought to occur from both inherited genes. Recent studies
indicate that up to 10% of autosomal genes can randomly commit to gene expression from a single allele,
termed monoallelic expression. Unlike X-inactivation or imprinting, MAE is independent of other genes and
leads to a diverse population of cells at the transcript level. The existence of MAE of PID genes is unknown.
Families with mutations in JAK1 or PLCG2 exhibit incomplete disease penetrance. My preliminary data
suggests that both JAK1 and PLCG2 can undergo MAE. Within this proposal I aim to 1) Map MAE of PID
genes in primary immune cells and 2) evaluate the functional impact of monoallelic expression in JAK1
and PLCG2 ex vivo. The findings of this proposal will inform the biological study and clinical genetics of PIDs
by identifying thresholds of transcript diversity which drive disease penetrance. In addition, these findings will
provide a framework for similar work in other genetic diseases, while setting a foundation for mechanistic
studies directed at the control of MAE as a therapeutic for monogenic disease."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a diverse family of integral membrane proteins that recognize an
assortment of extracellular molecules including neurotransmitters, hormones, light and odors. Accordingly, they
are important pharmaceutical targets, with over 1200 FDA approved drugs targeting GPCRs. However, many
GPCRs have unknown biologic roles. Thus, uncovering the function and physiologic significance of
understudied GPCRs represents a wealth of untapped therapeutic potential. Our lab previously reported that
an adhesion-class GPCR (aGPCR), Gpr116, is among the most highly expressed GPCRs in the kidney.
However, its role in renal physiology had not been investigated. Recently published data presented in the
current proposal demonstrate localization of Gpr116 to the apical membrane of A-intercalated cells (AICs) in
murine collecting ducts. Furthermore, deletion of Gpr116 from AICs using a targeted Cre-Lox recombination
system revealed Gpr116 to be a critical regulator of renal acid excretion. Mice deficient for Gpr116 in the
kidney have significantly reduced urine pH and are incapable of further acidifying their urine after induction of a
metabolic acidosis, suggesting that loss of Gpr116 is sufficient to maximally acidify urine. Notably, the
reduction in urine pH is accompanied with an increase in blood pH and a decrease in pCO2, an acid/base
disorder we term “renal tubular alkalosis”. Moreover, Gpr116-null animals have significantly more surface
expression of V-ATPase proton pumps in AICs. Although these findings are significant, there are still
substantial gaps in our knowledge regarding the function of Gpr116 in the kidney. For example, the molecular
mechanisms that cause urine acidification in the absence of Gpr116 in AICs are unknown, and the
endogenous activator of the receptor has yet to be identified. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal
is to address these critical components of Gpr116 renal physiology. Based on previous observations and
strong preliminary data outlined in this proposal, I hypothesize that Gpr116 activation is facilitated by
membrane-bound glycoproteins in the microvilli of stimulated AICs, leading to a Rho GTPase cascade and a
retrieval of V-ATPase from the luminal membrane. These support my central hypothesis that Gpr116 acts as a
negative-feedback element to inhibit excessive acid secretion through regulation of V-ATPase endocytosis. I
have proposed the following specific aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Determine the Gpr116-activated pathways
that inhibit V-ATPase surface expression; and 2) Identify interactions and luminal conditions that facilitate
endogenous activation of Gpr116 in AICs. Completion of these studies will define the molecular pathways
relevant to Gpr116 in the kidney for the first time and establish the therapeutic potential of Gpr116 as a
targeted modulator of renal acid excretion."

Obesity is a global epidemic that greatly increases the risk for developing hypertension and cardiovascular
disease. The molecular mechanisms connecting hypertension with obesity are poorly understood, however,
and optimal treatment strategies are unclear as some antihypertensive drugs elicit adverse metabolic side
effects. This illustrates the critical need to identify new therapeutic targets with a positive metabolic profile for
treatment of obesity hypertension. We propose that angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), a protective hormone of the renin-
angiotensin system, provides this ideal target. Ang-(1-7) binds mas receptors (masR) to lower blood pressure
and improve metabolic function in obese and hypertensive rodents; but the mechanisms involved are
unknown. Our preliminary data show that Ang-(1-7) depressor effects require activation of masR within the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). More specifically, we show that Ang-(1-7) masR are highly
localized to proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-containing neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter
GABA. Activation of GABAergic POMC neurons by Ang-(1-7) could lower blood pressure by inhibiting
downstream melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) signaling in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), but
this has not been explored. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that Ang-(1-7) stimulates ARC POMC
neurons to enhance GABAergic neurotransmission onto PVN neurons to lower blood pressure. Aim 1 will
determine if POMC masR are required for Ang-(1-7) to inhibit PVN neuronal activity and lower blood pressure.
To test this, we will employ a novel transgenic mouse model to determine if deletion of masR from POMC
neurons prevents the ability of Ang-(1-7) to enhance GABAergic activity in the PVN and lower blood pressure
under normal conditions and in the context of high fat diet-induced obesity hypertension. Aim 2 will determine if
high fat diet decreases, and Ang-(1-7) treatment restores, GABAergic transmission onto MC4R-expressing
PVN neurons. To test this, we will employ MC4R-GFP mice to determine if: high fat diet decreases inhibitory
neurotransmission in MC4R-expressing PVN neurons, Ang-(1-7) treatment reverses these effects, and
changes in inhibitory neurotransmission in MC4R-PVN neurons correlate with blood pressure. The findings
from this proposal will provide new insight into the neural mechanisms by which Ang-(1-7) lowers blood
pressure as well as the potential for therapeutic targeting of Ang-(1-7) in obesity hypertension. Importantly, this
proposal will logically build upon the PI’s background in molecular neuroscience and allow her to develop a
new skillset in integrated molecular and whole animal physiological and pharmacological methods to assess
neural mechanisms engaged by Ang-(1-7) for cardiovascular regulation. The PI will receive strong mentorship
and a research framework to establish an independent and novel area of research to help meet her long-term
career goal of becoming an independent investigator at an academic research institution where she can
conduct collaborative and clinically relevant cardiovascular neuroscience research."

The 5-year overall survival rate for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is less than 35%, making it the most fatal

impaired in AML. These impairments correlate to worse overall survival and clinical outcomes, highlighting the
importance of understanding the mechanisms by which AML alters NK cell development and function. To better
understand these defects, we assessed the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of NK cells in AML and
discovered that mature NK cells from AML patients are globally hypomethylated when compared to normal
controls and have abnormal activation of activating protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1, which is a set of transcription factor
(TF) dimers primarily composed of Jun and Fos family proteins, has been shown to regulate ILC development
and homeostasis, chromatin accessibility, and immune cell exhaustion. The activity of AP-1 is regulated by
upstream mitogen activated protein kinases p38, JNK and ERK through transcription activation and post-
translational modifications. In this proposal, we will determine how the MEK/ERK signaling branch of the AP-1
signaling pathway contributes to NK cell defects in AML and whether development and function can be restored
through AP-1 pathway inhibition. We hypothesize that AP-1 signaling is a critical regulator of NK cell development
and function that becomes dysregulated in AML. These studies will first describe the mechanism(s) by which the
AP-1 pathway influences NK cell development in the setting of AML (Aim 1). We will use pharmacologic agents
as well as CRISPRcas9 editing to understand how aberrant AP-1 signaling skews human NK cell development.
We will also determine the functional consequences of aberrant AP-1 activation in mature NK cells (Aim 2).
Finally, we will assess the therapeutic efficacy of AP-1 pathway regulation in multiple in vivo models of AML (Aim
3). Results from these studies will further our mechanistic understanding of NK cell development in AML to better
inform therapeutic strategies."

 The goal of this proposal is to determine how cell identity, as defined by a transcriptional program, is
inherited through mitosis by systematically evaluating the role of specific cis-regulatory elements and trans-
acting factors. The central hypothesis is that cis-regulatory elements at gene promoters maintain transcriptional
competency through mitosis while trans interactions with enhancers mediate the timely and appropriate level of
gene expression during mitotic exit. This proposal will leverage how the underlying DNA sequence determines
the multifaceted interactions at promoters and cell-type specific enhancers that ensure cells faithfully re-
establish proper transcriptional programs. This will be evaluated in cells with a stable identity and expanded to
understand how this is mediated in the context of early development, when cells undergo constant fate
decisions. While it was previously thought that chromatin condensation during mitosis excluded most proteins
and thereby transcription-related processes, recent studies originally emanating from the Zaret lab now
indicate that transcription is active at a low level and promoters, but not most enhancers, are accessible and
maintain active histone modifications [1-7]; and mitotic chromatin arms retain areas of dynamic chromatin [8].
Although genome-wide measurements of histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and chromatin
organization suggest mitotic changes at various cis-regulatory elements, they are unable to garner high-
resolution mechanistic insight into how mitotic memory is retained at promoters and acted upon, during mitotic
exit, by enhancers. While components involved in transcription such as the TATA-binding protein TBP, the
elongating form of RNAP2, and transcription factors (TFs) such as GATA1, FOXA1, and ESRRB are detected
on mitotic chromatin; many of these TFs do not remain bound to their interphase enhancer targets, thus how
these factors function at specific loci to transmit transcription memory through mitosis remains elusive [5-7, 9-
13]. Therefore, this proposal aims to determine how cell fate is preserved through cell division by first
evaluating the functional requirement for promoters in mitotic transcription, and then the mechanisms
employed by liver-specific transcription factors to mediate enhancer activation upon mitotic exit. This will be
assessed in the liver-derived HUH7 human cell line, which is highly amenable to mitotic synchronization
methods, and expanded to determine the role of identified factors in pluripotent and endoderm-differentiated
human embryonic stem cells. This proposal will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
maintain cell identity and cell fate specification, thereby improving our ability to target and modulate stem cells
for therapeutic value."
10745653,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical center for controlling reward-related and motivated behaviors, and
becomes disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders such as drug addiction and depression. The NAc consists of a
core (NAcCore) and surrounding medial shell (NAcMS), each of which integrates distinct excitatory inputs from
a wide range of brain areas. These NAc subregions contain a variety of cells, most of which are GABAergic, with
the exception of cholinergic interneurons (CINs). Through the release of acetylcholine, CINs can powerfully
modulate the local network to impact the output of the NAc. However, the ability of CINs to receive and process
different long-range excitatory inputs is largely unexplored in the NAc. To understand the circuit mechanisms of
normal and pathological behavior, it is necessary to study the synaptic organization of CINs in the NAc in a
subregion- and input-specific manner. Here I use a combination of viral tracing methods, slice electrophysiology,
and optogenetics in transgenic mice to establish the synaptic organization of CINs in the NAc. Aim 1 will identify
which brain regions and local striatal cells synapse onto CINs in both the NAcMS and NAcCore. Aim 2 will
assess how different types of long-range inputs contact and influence the firing of CINs in each NAc subregion.
Aim 3 will test how different GABAergic interneurons mediate feed-forward inhibition of CINs to regulate their
activity. Together, these experiments will provide critical insights into the synaptic organization of CINs within
the NAc and how different inputs drive unique patterns of activity. This work is necessary for understanding how
the NAc integrates converging inputs containing information about motivational drive, reward value, and
attention, and ultimately how the circuitry of this key reward center is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders."

Urinary Stone Disease (USD) is an increasingly prevalent and highly recurrent condition associated
with major morbidity at a rising cost to society. Thus, improved management can significantly reduce
its health burden. Increasing fluid intake is recommended to all USD patients. However, knowledge
gaps persist regarding the impact of fluid therapy in preventing USD recurrence including effectiveness
of strategies to achieve and maintain a high urine volume, and whether such strategies reduce USD
recurrence. The Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) study is a randomized clinical trial
investigating the impact of increased fluid intake and increased urine output on the recurrence rate of
USD in adults and children. In this study 1,642 participants will be randomized to a control or
intervention arm. Participants in both arms receive a “smart water bottle”. The intervention arm involves
an additional program of behavioral interventions, including financial incentives, structured problem
solving, and low touch interventions designed to improve adherence to a prescribed fluid intake
regimen. The primary endpoint is occurrence of a stone event during a two-year observation period.
The PUSH study is in its third year, and due to multiple challenges to recruitment of study participants,
follow-up of participants and data collection have not yet been completed. Additional time is needed to
ensure study completion and to accomplish all study goals. Although ureteral stenting is routinely
performed after urological procedures for USD to mitigate peri-operative complications, stents cause
significant patient discomfort. The causal mechanisms are only partly understood. The STudy to
Enhance uNderstanding of sTent-associated Symptoms (STENTS) is a prospective observational
cohort study enrolling adolescents and adults undergoing ureteroscopic intervention for ureteral and/or
renal stones. Participants undergo detailed symptom assessment using validated questionnaires, a
psychosocial assessment, quantitative sensory testing for evaluation of pain sensitization, and detailed
collection of clinical and operative data. Biospecimens (blood and urine) are being collected for future
research. Recruitment to the STENTS study and follow-up of the participants are expected to be
completed during the original project period. However, additional time and resources are needed for
analysis of collected study data. In Aim 1 of this application, the investigators will continue and complete
participant enrollment for the PUSH study, continue biospecimen collection for the NIDDK Repository,
analyze the data, and prepare and submit several planned manuscripts related to the study hypotheses.
In Aim 2 of this applications, the investigators will analyze the data from the STENTS study, interpret
findings, and disseminate findings through peer reviewed publications."

In response to large numbers of senior center clients who suffer untreated depression and the dearth of
geriatric mental health providers, we have partnered with senior center stakeholders to simplify Behavioral
Activation (BA) to match the skill set of lay volunteers (“Do More, Feel Better”; DMFB).
The lay delivery model: 1. makes use of existing volunteer resources that can address the insufficient
workforce; and 2. has potential for being an acceptable and sustainable delivery model. However, the capacity
of this model to engage the same target (increased activity) and to yield comparable clinical outcomes as
professionally-delivered interventions is yet to be determined in a fully-powered trial.
This Collaborative R01 proposes fully powered randomized effectiveness trial testing the effect of DMFB in
comparison to professionally-delivered BA (MSW BA) on increased activity level (target) and decreased
depressive symptoms.
The specific aims are to: 1. Test the effectiveness of DMFB, in comparison to MSW BA, for depressed (PHQ-
9>10 and Ham-D>14) older adults (>60) on increasing overall activity level (target) and reducing depression
symptoms; and 2. test whether increased activity level predicts greater reduction in depression severity and
whether increased activity’s impact on depression is non-inferior across conditions.
Client participants will be a total of 288 older (>60 years) non-psychotic, non-demented individuals with elevated
depressive symptoms from 6 Seattle, 6 New York City, and 6 Tampa area senior centers serving economically
and ethnically diverse communities. Eligible clients will be randomized within senior center to either DMFB
(n=144) or MSW BA (n=144). Two lay volunteers and 2 MSWs per center will provide the intervention.
Our proposal responds to the 2012 IOM report which highlighted the dearth of mental health providers for older
adults and the need to develop a workforce of nontraditional providers. DMFB is a streamlined BA intervention
that has high potential for sustainability by making use of an untapped volunteer resource and supervision
infrastructure within senior centers. Our findings will identify effective interventions for an underserved and
difficult to engage population, our partners in aging services would be pleased to implement either delivery
format of BA to activate depressed older adults."
10755321,"As endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease, estrogen/estrogen receptor (ER) signaling
has an essential role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. We revealed that cytoplasmic ERβ interacts with the
apoptosis machinery and inflammasome complex in endometriotic tissues to prevent apoptosis and stimulate
cell proliferation activity, respectively. However, the function of nuclear ERβ in the pathogenesis of endometriosis
has not yet been elucidated. To fill this gap in the scientific knowledge, we have determined the endometriotic
tissue-specific ERβ-regulated transcriptome and ERβ-cistrome by using a novel endometrium-specific ERβ
overexpression mouse model. Our new omics data provided three unique aspects of nuclear ERβ function that
drive endometriosis progression. 1) The increases in anti-apoptosis signaling in the endometrium is one of the
critical drivers that promote the progression of endometriosis. Our omics data revealed that the ERβ/Nuclear
Factor of Activated T-cell 5 (NFAT5) complex directly downregulates the expression of N-Myc and STAT
Interactor (NMI), which stimulates interferon (IFN)α-induced cell death signaling. In Aim 1, we will investigate
the role of NMI in IFNα-induced cell death signaling in the normal endometrium and then identify whether the
ERβ/NFAT5 complex downregulates the expression of NMI in endometriotic lesions to enhance endometriosis.
Since epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is elevated in endometriotic tissue and involved in anti-
apoptosis, we will also investigate the role of EGFR in the ERβ/NFAT5-mediated suppression of NMI expression
in endometriotic tissues. 2) The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step for endometriosis. Our
omics data showed that the ERβ/Early Growth Response Protein 1 (EGR1) axis directly increased the expression
of Fibrillin1 (FBN1), which is an activator of EMT, in ectopic lesions. In Aim 2, we will define the role of FBN1 in
endometriosis-associated EMT in ectopic lesions and then determine whether the ERβ/EGR1 axis upregulates
FBN1 gene expression in ectopic lesions to stimulate EMT in ectopic lesions. Since EGFR signaling also plays
an essential role in EMT, the role of EGFR in ERβ/EGR1 axis-mediated EMT will be investigated. 3) To establish
endometriosis, angiogenesis is activated in ectopic lesions. However, the molecular mechanism of estrogen-
induced angiogenesis in ectopic lesions has not been elucidated. Our data revealed that ERβ elevated the
expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which is the activator of hypoxia inducible factor 1a
(HIF1A)-mediated angiogenesis, in ectopic lesions. In Aim 3, we will define the role of CTGF in endometriosis-
associated angiogenesis and then determine whether the ERβ/HIF1A axis upregulates CTGF gene expression
in ectopic lesions to stimulate angiogenesis. Since EGFR signaling also plays an essential role in angiogenesis,
the role of EGFR in ERβ/HIF1A axis-mediated angiogenesis will be investigated. Collectively, these three ERβ
gene networks will conceptionally advance our understanding of the molecular etiology of endometriosis and
should provide new molecular therapeutic targets for alternative endometriosis therapies."

The field of epigenomics is expanding rapidly, driven in large part by new and evolving technology,
methods, and techniques. It also is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. The rapid advance of
omics technologies into multiple specialty disciplines has created a new series of challenges for
scientists-in-training, primarily because every technique or software program has its own
assumptions, biases, caveats, and relative merits that directly affect (or limit) the conclusions that
can be drawn from such studies. The objectives of the “Epigenomics Workshop for Graduate
Students” are to provide a broad overview of cutting-edge omics technologies, epigenetics
research questions, and an intimate, problem-based learning environment with research experts
so that participants will understand innovative methods for studying epigenomics, apply these
tools to interdisciplinary research questions in the field, and build meaningful connections with
research leaders and other graduate students in the broader epigenomics field. The one-week
workshop at Van Andel Research Institute will be led by epigenomics research leaders and have
space for 15 graduate students per year. It will increase diversity and enhance the training of 75
biomedical researchers to meet the growing demand for highly skilled epigenomics researchers
with broad foundations, enabling them to tackle innovative, interdisciplinary questions and bring
this knowledge back to their current labs. We also will build a community of early career
epigenomics scientists who are connected beyond their subfields to the broader epigenomics
field."

The lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of transcriptional regulators are important for normal
development and their dysregulation is associated with intellectual disability and with several forms of
cancer. However, a lack of understanding of the normal physiological roles of KDM5 proteins has
hindered our understanding of how their loss or gain leads to disease states. Thus, the long-term goal
of these studies is to define the molecular mechanisms by which KDM5 regulates essential gene
regulatory programs using the genetically elegant model organism Drosophila. Specifically, we focus
on defining mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by KDM5 that are independent of its well-
established histone demethylase activity. The importance of illuminating demethylase-independent
gene regulatory mechanisms is highlighted by our observation that KDM5 carries out its essential
developmental activities separately from its enzymatic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying these non-canonical functions of KDM5 remain unknown. Our new data show that a region
within the C-terminus of KDM5 that has no previously known function is required for viability.
Moreover, interactome studies link the C-terminus of KDM5 to the non-specific lethal (NSL)
transcriptional activation complex. These and other data lead us to propose the central hypothesis
that a KDM5 interacts with the NSL complex to orchestrate gene expression programs needed for
animal survival. To test this, we will use a range of genetic, molecular and cell biological approaches
to define the target genes and pathways regulated by KDM5 that are critical for development, and to
determine the molecular links between KDM5, NSL and transcriptional regulation. This study is
innovative in our focus on defining demethylase-independent activities of KDM5 and our use of state-
of-the-art techniques. This work is significant because we will provide fundamental insights into KDM5
function that will be broadly relevant for our understanding of gene regulation by multi-domain
proteins. Our work is also expected to highlight potential mechanisms by which KDM5 dysregulation
could contribute to intellectual disability and/or cancer."
10906981,"Abstract: Respiratory infections have been among the top three leading causes of global deaths for decades. Their
importance is reinforced by the emergence of novel highly transmissible respiratory pathogens, as witnessed in the current
SARS-CoV-2 and past influenza pandemics. Current influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are focused on eliciting
antibodies to highly mutable viral surface proteins, and frequent vaccine reformulations are needed to match the antigenicity
of constantly evolving viral strains or variants that evade vaccine-elicited antibodies. Therefore, elicitation of lung tissue-
resident memory T cells (TRMs), which recognize epitopes that are conserved across viral variants is critical to elicit broad
anti-viral immunity. We have developed combination adjuvant-based subunit mucosal vaccine formulations that elicit
exceptionally strong and functionally diverse lung/airway CD8 and CD4 TRMs and provide effective and broad
protection against influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. However, a central
question is whether vaccine efficacy studies in SPF mice are translatable to humans, who are exposed to diverse
microbial species. In recent years, Dirty mice (SPF mice cohoused with pet store mice), have been used to model human
immune responses. Significantly, TRM numbers are greatly increased in Dirty mice, but the underlying mechanisms are
unknown. We have exciting preliminary data that the lungs and spleen of Dirty mice have markedly elevated number of
Granzyme BHI/CD44HI CD8 T cells with transcriptional attributes (T-betLO/EOMESLO/TCF-1LO) reminiscent of precursor
TRMs, which are poised for a TRM cell fate. The overarching goal is to exploit the high resolution of our combination
adjuvant-based vaccine approach and the Dirty mouse model to elucidate the effects of diverse microbial exposure on the
development of pre-TRMs and their subsequent differentiation into TRMs that protect against respiratory viruses. Specific
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that diverse microbial exposure influences the development and protective functions of lung
TRMs against IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we will compare the development and transcriptional programming of lung TRMs
induced by two combination adjuvant vaccine formulations and protective immunity to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in SPF and
Dirty mice. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that diverse microbial exposure promotes the conditioning of
circulating/lymphoid pre-TRMs, leading to enhanced differentiation of TRMs in lungs of vaccinated Dirty mice. Here, in Dirty
and SPF mice, we will incisively dissect whether diverse microbial exposure enhances the pre-conditioning of naïve CD8
or CD4 T cells prior to vaccination and/or antigen-activated effector T cells during vaccination, to a TRM cell fate.
Impact:. Proposed studies will leverage microbial exposure to improve the rigor of mouse models to predict human
immune response to vaccines, and provide mechanistic insights into the development of TRMs in the lung under conditions
of diverse microbial exposure. Hence, this exploratory ‘high pay off’ R21 application blends significance and innovation
to lay the conceptual framework for further mechanistic investigations that will pave the way for the development of a
biologically relevant and translatable pre-clinical animal model to learn how we can leverage microbiota to enhance vaccine-
induced T-cell immunity to IAV and SARS-CoV-2, which are human respiratory viruses of public health importance."
10755670,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000-
500,000 deaths. 90% of influenza-related deaths occur in older adults despite widespread vaccination programs
with vaccines tailored for this high-risk group. The estimated effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in the U.S.
for the 2018-2019 influenza season overall was 47%, but only 12-13% in older adults. There is therefore an
urgent need to understand the mechanisms that are turned on/off in older adults that result in their limited
response rate to the most commonly used influenza vaccine, Fluzone® High-Dose. There is also a need to
understand whether and why next-generation influenza vaccines might be more efficacious. Immunosenescence
is known to be associated with declines in optimal B cell and T cell adaptive immunity, however, our overall
understanding of the mechanisms of immunosenescence is incomplete. The central goal of this proposal is to
understand the mechanisms that lead to a loss of response to influenza vaccine in older adults through
establishment of the 3FluAging cohort of healthy older adults who will be vaccinated with three different
influenza vaccines three years in a row. We hypothesize that aging impacts specific regulatory mechanisms of
humoral immunity to reduce vaccine effectiveness. In Aim 1, we will establish a cohort of 60 healthy older adults
(≥65yrs) who will sequentially receive three different annual influenza vaccines, with serial blood and microbiome
sample collection during three years of follow-up. Participants will undergo regular clinical assessments. In Aim
2, we will decipher the magnitude and immunodominance pattern of the humoral response to influenza virus in
healthy older individuals upon vaccination. For each vaccine, we will characterize antibody titer and quality and
will define responders and non-responders. In Aim 3, we will characterize the epigenome, transcriptome,
cytokine production, and cell proportions of blood leukocytes in vaccinated healthy older participants. We will
identify specific (epi)genomic and functional signatures, and their longevity, associated with vaccine response.
We will also sequence all participants to uncover the role of genetic variation on influenza vaccine responses. In
Aim 4, we will assess the function of T helper cells and antigen presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells, in
influenza vaccine responders and non-responders. By identifying responders and non-responders for each
vaccine and integrating these data with baseline immune status multi-omic signatures, we will determine which
immune features can predict vaccine responsiveness. We expect to identify humoral immunity pathways that are
altered in aging that can be used as the basis for designing novel approaches to boost efficacy of the most
commonly used, as well as emerging, influenza vaccines."

 This is an application for a K08 Career Development Award for Gal Finer, MD, PhD, an Assistant
Professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University. This applicant has clinical training in
Pediatric Nephrology and research training in immunology, genetics, and molecular biology. Her long-term
career goal is to become an independently funded researcher with expertise in renal development. This
proposal will position the applicant to gain advanced skills in developmental biology and pertinent experimental
methods. To achieve these goals, Dr. Finer has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team with expertise
in extramurally funded research, and she will be participating in coursework, seminars, and conferences.
 The broad, long-term objectives of the project included in this career development award are to decipher
the molecular mechanisms that cause congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and to
identify novel therapeutic targets. CAKUT is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the first three
decades of life and is associated with survival rate that is 30 times lower than that of healthy children. However,
very little is known about the pathogenesis of CAKUT, and in the absence of prevention or curative treatment,
care relies mainly on dialysis and transplantation. The nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) are multipotent cells
that are critical for ensuring normal nephron number and normal kidney size at birth. It has been shown that, in
normal development, these cells strike a balance between self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation
(NPC dynamics). However, the basic mechanisms that control these “stem-like” cells are poorly understood.
The Quaggin lab has identified a novel bHLH transcription factor, Tcf21, that is critical for kidney development.
We preliminary show that Tcf21 controls the expression of Cited1 and Wnt4, two β-catenin targets that are
involved in NPC self-renewal and differentiation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Tcf21 controls
NPC dynamics by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We will utilize unique genetic mouse models of Tcf21-
depleted NPCs that present CAKUT-spectrum renal dysplasia to dissociate the effects of Tcf21 on NPC
differentiation. Our Specific Aims are to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which Tcf21 regulates NPCs.
To address our aims, we will perform molecular analysis of the β-catenin pathway, analysis of genetic breeding,
morphological analysis of the nephrogenic niche, lineage tracing, and single-cell RNA-sequencing.
 This work will be mentored by Dr. Susan Quaggin, Head of the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension
and the Director of the Feinberg School Cardiovascular and Renal Institute at Northwestern University. Dr.
Quaggin is an internationally acclaimed developmental nephrologist with extensive mentoring experience. The
single-cell RNA analysis of this proposal will be mentored by Dr. Deborah Winter for her expertise in
computational biology and bioinformatics in genomic studies. This project will also benefit from the exceptional

The control of gene expression in mammals relies in part on modifications to cytosine residues in DNA, which
exist in at least five forms: cytosine (C), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-
formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). DNA methyltransferases methylate cytosine at the 5-
position, generating 5mC in the genome. Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC,
5fC, and 5caC in three consecutive oxidation reactions. These modifications are dynamically regulated during
development and cell differentiation. To understand the function of these modifications and the regulatory
mechanisms that control the levels and genomic distribution of the five forms of the cytosine, we propose to
study the enzymes/proteins that generate, read, and remove these DNA modifications as well as associated
histone methylation."

Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about
the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC,
surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of
colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by
increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects
early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of
liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with
administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement
(DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver
tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due
to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and
variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the
scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are
coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging
of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing
these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin-
echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a
radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of
the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with
efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor
characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for
continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim
3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w
and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by
developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include
technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for
the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements
that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in
particular those with colorectal cancer."

Oligodendrocytes are the resident myelinating cell type of the central nervous system. Recent work indicates
that different classes of neurons have differing patterns and distribution of myelin along their axons. Yet only
recently has the identity of the axons been considered with respect to myelination. Thus, the mechanisms of
axon signaling and selection for myelination remain largely unknown. Our lab and others have shown that
neuronal activity increases myelination and synaptic vesicle release occurs along axons underneath myelin
sheaths, suggesting oligodendrocytes may need to be able to receive and interpret neurotransmitter signaling.
A single oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to 40 distinct axons, posing a unique situation where an individual
cell may need to adapt to signaling from many different neurons. How might this be achieved? Oligodendrocytes
express many canonical post-synaptic factors, ostensibly to aid in signaling between the axon and myelin sheath,
but the role these proteins play in myelinating cells is largely unknown. Using a zebrafish model, this proposal
will utilize genetic approaches and in vivo imaging to address two fundamental concepts: is there a pattern to
the expression and/or localization of these post-synaptic factors in oligodendrocytes and does this correspond
to wrapped axonal identity; and what function do they serve in the process of myelination. This will be achieved
in two aims: Aim 1 tests what post-synaptic factors are expressed, where these post-synaptic proteins localize,
and when are they important; and Aim 2 tests how these proteins function to facilitate myelination, and if there
is a correlation between axon identity and localization and function of post-synaptic proteins in myelinating
oligodendrocytes."

this goal. Structures have been created to help assure that the plans of the Consortium are congruent with 
those of the member institutions. With the help of Consortium Administration, methods have been developed to 
monitor the activities of the Consortium as directed by the planning process and to help assure that these 
activities are communicated to Consortium members. Robust processes have been created to evaluate 
progress made in achieving the goals set out in the planning process, report the results of the evaluations back 
to involved members, review responses to the evaluations, and evaluate the outcomes of those responses. 
The specific aims for Leadership, Planning & Evaluation are (1) with input from internal and external experts, 
to identify those areas where investments of time and resources are most likely to assist the Consortium in 
achieving its mission to eliminate cancer as a cause of suffering and death; (2) to create a structure that 
engages all Consortium partners in planning so that individual institutional objectives are well aligned with 
Consortium objectives, (3) to continuously monitor and communicate Consortium activities to all stakeholders,

The COVID-19 pandemic intersecting with the opioid epidemic led to dramatic shifts in the delivery of care for
opioid use disorders (OUD). Historically, methadone has been provided as directly-observed therapy (DOT) at
opioid treatment programs (OTPs). This model of care delivery has been a barrier to accessing care due to
imposed travel burden and disruption to work and family responsibilities for clients. To minimize infectious
risks, on March 16, 2020 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration issued a blanket
exception to OTPs allowing for 28 day supplies of take-home medications for all “stable” clients, and up to
14-day supplies for clients who are “less stable”. These changes created an opportunity to innovate
methadone care delivery models to allow more flexibility and client-centeredness by requiring fewer in-person
visits. Yet, less frequent DOT could lead to increased risk for diversion and medication toxicity. An ideal model
would optimize both flexibility and safety. Our prior Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of an
innovative mobile health platform to provide asynchronous, video DOT and to screen for symptoms of
COVID-19 for patients treated for OUD with methadone. We propose to extend our prior research by scaling
the intervention (video-DOT) across a large, multisite OTP organization via a Hybrid Type 2
Effectiveness-Implementation study with stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design in which we will
simultaneously test implementation and clinical outcomes. Our Aim 1: Conduct a stepped wedge randomized
trial to evaluate the impact of asynchronous video-DOT on verification of methadone dosing, increased
take-homes, and other treatment outcomes. Three clinics within a single, large OTP organization will be
randomly assigned to calendar time for implementation of video-DOT. Clinical outcomes will be assessed
pragmatically via electronic health records (pre- and post-implementation) and via the smartphone application
to examine if implementation of video-DOT is associated with primary outcomes of (1) increases in the
proportion of methadone doses that are observed (remote or in-person) and (2) increased take-homes, and
secondary outcomes of (3) reduced in-person OTP visits, (4) increased medication coverage, and (5)
increased 90-day treatment retention. Our Aim 2: Conduct a formative evaluation to: a) understand barriers
and facilitators to implementation of video-DOT at each clinic, b) understand perspectives on and
acceptability/feasibility of video-DOT among key stakeholders, and c) develop best practices to support optimal
scalability of video-DOT. We will conduct qualitative interviews with medical providers, counselors, dispensary
nurses, clinical leaders, and clients to understand (1) barriers/facilitators to implementing VDOT, (2)
opportunities to improve video-DOT and future implementations, and (3) perspectives regarding clients and
circumstances for which video-DOT is useful. The findings of this research will inform efforts to disseminate
and implement video-DOT for methadone more broadly to expand access and improve patient-centered care
and outcomes for persons with OUD."

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, an estimated 1.2 million people—including 158,500
(13%) with undiagnosed infection—were living with HIV in the United States. Since then, HIV control
efforts have been complicated by disruptions to HIV testing, care-related services, and case surveillance
activities in state and local jurisdictions. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV
transmission, incidence and outcomes has been difficult to quantify.
Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a non-invasive and unbiased surveillance approach that can be
used to estimate infectious disease occurrence in the population by detecting pathogen DNA or RNA in
pooled community samples of wastewater. Here we propose to apply a novel WBE HIV surveillance
method to measure HIV-1 nucleic acids in wastewater to estimate HIV incidence in sewersheds during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This research study will pursue three specific aims: (1) to develop and validate a
quantification method for HIV-1 nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) in urine, feces and wastewater settled
solids, (2) in 30 people living with HIV, to c orrelate HIV nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) shedding in urine and
feces with plasma viral load, and (3) using archived samples of wastewater rom Santa Clara and San
Francisco Counties during the COVID pandemic, to determine trends in wastewater HIV-1 nucleic acid
levels and compare findings with community case rates of HIV.
The overarching goal of this project is to establish an HIV quantification method for wastewater-based
surveillance using digital droplet, reverse transcription-PCR analysis that can be used to monitor HIV in
the community. We hypothesize that wastewater surveillance can identify populations disproportionately
affected by HIV, facilitating allocation of resources to those at highest risk, thereby maximizing HIV
control. Investigating rates of changes in HIV nucleic acid in wastewater in relation to COVID-19 may also
improve our understanding of how pandemic disease and its control strategies can impact HIV surveillance
and patient care. Knowledge gained from this project will help establish a framework for wastewater-based
surveillance for HIV in the US and globally that can reduce health disparities, improve health outcomes
and prevent HIV transmission."

The United States has among the worst maternal outcomes of developed countries, which are
disproportionately experienced by Black birthing people due to the intersections of racism, social determinants
of health, and inadequate health care delivery. Racial disparities in severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and
maternal mortality (MM) are particularly stark in Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny County, where Black
birthing people are more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than in 97% of comparable cities. Notably,
80% of maternal deaths can be prevented, and 65% of maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period, which
underscores why postpartum clinical care is critical to reduce maternal mortality. Current models of postpartum
care are limited by: 1) gaps in health care delivery at the very timepoints at which people are vulnerable to
pregnancy-related death; 2) health care delivery frameworks that are not culturally sensitive and have not been
developed with community feedback; and/or 3) social determinants of health (e.g., low income), which our
formative work has found prevent some Black birthing people from attending postpartum clinic visits. If
thoughtfully delivered, postpartum care may identify physical signs and symptoms among birthing people that
signal impending pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. In this project, we seek to develop a novel, equity-
centered model of postpartum care to reduce SMM and MM among Black birthing people in our region. We will
build upon an existing model of maternal health screening that is carried out at well-child visits, and integrate a
newer model of postpartum care, the “Fourth Trimester,” which includes early maternal physical examinations
and anthropometric screening at well-child visits. Using qualitative research methods, we will seek feedback
from people who receive care from the current postpartum care model, as well as feedback from clinicians and
staff to identify barriers and facilitators to postpartum care. Next, we will engage with partners from the
Community and Training Cores of the Equity in Birth Outcomes and Reproductive Health through Community
Engagement (EMBRACE) Center, to develop a community-informed model of postpartum care and to train
health care providers to provide equitable, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive clinical care. Finally, we will
implement the new model of postpartum care over a multi-year period in family planning clinics, to assess the
satisfaction of Black birthing people, and clinical and implementation outcomes. We will also pilot a novel cash
transfer intervention among a subset of these people, responding to prior research that suggests that financial
constraints not only contribute to acute stress in the postpartum period, but also undermine engagement with
postpartum healthcare. Our objective is for our new model of equity-centered postpartum care to be scalable to
other health settings, and for our development process to serve as a blueprint for other healthcare systems to
develop clinical care models that improve health outcomes and well-being among Black birthing people."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms that regulate sub-cellular organization and
the significance of this organization to organelle and cell function. Cells are highly compartmentalized at multiple
length scales. At the micron scale, organelles are organized within the cytoplasm and occupy specific sub-
cellular zones. Proteins and nucleic acids organize into assemblies at the nanometer scale in the cytosol, nucleus
and on cellular membranes to ensure high fidelity of biochemical reactions. This highly orchestrated
spatiotemporal organization maintains cellular homeostasis. Not surprisingly, disruptions to the spatiotemporal
organization of organelles, proteins and nucleic acids are hallmarks of diseases. In this context, we seek to
address three key biological questions: 1. How do molecular assemblies of motor and adapter proteins regulate
the transport and spatial positioning of organelles and how are these assemblies disrupted in diseases. 2. How
is the molecular identity of organelles such as lysosomes, in turn, linked to organelle positioning and dictate
organelle function in health and disease states? 3. What is the cause/consequence relationship between the
spatial organization and physical compaction of the genome within the nucleus, the epigenetic modifications,
and gene activity? To address these questions, we will take an innovative approach of combining cell biological
tools with new, advanced, and quantitative microscopy methods that enable us to visualize the spatial
organization of cells in situ and with near molecular spatial resolution. This proposal builds on major advances
made by my group in the past 12 years in developing quantitative advanced microscopy tools including
quantitative, multiplexed super-resolution microscopy. These methods make it possible to address the molecular
scale questions that we are asking in the cell context and with unprecedented quantitative detail. We have used
these tools to visualize organelles moving along individual microtubule filaments inside cells, protein
nanoplatforms forming on microtubules, inside the cytosol and on organelle membranes, and the folding of the
chromatin fiber within the nucleus. These approaches provided new insights into how the microtubule
cytoskeleton and motor proteins collectively regulate organelle transport and how the folding of chromatin relates
to cell identity under physiological and pathological states. This proposal will build on our advances to elucidate
how multiple molecular parts assemble into functional transport units to regulate the positioning and ultimately
the function of organelles. We will further map the spatial proteome of these organelles to determine how their
molecular identity is linked to organelle positioning and function. Finally, we will seek to address the causal
relationship between chromatin structure and function. These areas and our method development integrate
synergistically to advance our understanding of how sub-cellular organization emerges, and the importance of
this organization for cell physiology and pathology."

The cause of Crohn's disease (CD) is believed to be rooted in the interactions between genetic susceptibilities
and exposures to environmental factors, such as specific gut microbes. Unfortunately, the complexity of these
interactions makes it difficult to understand what portion of CD risk is modifiable, and particularly whether gut
microbiome compositions can be altered to overcome one's underlying and fixed genetic predisposition. This
proposal will address whether individuals at high genetic risk for CD, but who never develop disease, harbor
characteristic gut microbial signatures that signal protection from CD. It will furthermore address whether
protective microbiomes can be transferred to diminish, delay, or prevent CD activity in others. Aim 1 will entail
the study of multigenerational families with multiplex CD – with the rationale that families, sharing common
living environments, meals, and behaviors, will minimize common confounders of human microbiome studies.
Individuals will be stratified by a polygenic risk score to better identify those at highest genetic risk but remain
disease-free and who are hypothesized as being most likely to harbor intestinal microbiomic and metabolomic
signatures that characterize disease protection. In Aim 2, select fecal biospecimens (collected in Aim 1)
containing putative protective microbiomes will be transplanted into a germ-free CD mouse model. These mice
will then be characterized by their phenotypic, microbial, metabolomic, and immune responses and assessed
for alterations in disease onset and severity. These studies will provide insights into microbially-mediated
modulators of CD activity; for example, clarifying the yet unknown reason why fecal transplants are very
effective for only a small portion of inflammatory bowel disease cases and why outcomes appear to be heavily
donor-dependent.
Coupling the study of an enriched human population with an animal model, to mechanistically test candidate
protective microbiomes, will streamline the scientific approach and expedite the transition of promising study
findings into clinical care. The scientific proposal and associated training plan will furthermore prepare the PI,
so that she will be well-equipped to lead future studies of host-microbe dynamics in inflammatory bowel
disease as an independent translational investigator."
10764958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ability of fibroblasts to synthesize extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is critical for wound healing; however,
this program is coopted by cancer cells in multiple solid tumors, resulting in the formation of cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) that drive a desmoplastic response which contributes to cancer progression and promotes
therapy resistance. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the ECM and has a unique amino acid composition
such that up to 25% of its sequence is represented by proline. Proline is a limiting metabolite for collagen
synthesis in CAFs, and CAFs promote proline biosynthesis by increasing mitochondrial glutaminolysis and
directing the resulting glutamate into the proline biosynthetic pathway instead of its utilization as an anaplerotic
substrate for the TCA cycle. However, the mechanism directing the differential utilization of glutamine for proline
or the TCA cycle is not understood. Besides, glutamine is depleted in many solid tumors such as pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but paradoxically, collagen is highly abundant in PDAC. The objective of the
present proposal is to gain a better understanding of the unique metabolic requirements for collagen production
in CAFs and thereby identify novel targets to reduce tumor desmoplasia. The proposed studies are aimed at
determining how CAFs redirect glutamine into proline biosynthesis (Aim 1) and identifying the adaptive
mechanisms by which CAFs sustain collagen production when extracellular glutamine is limited (Aim 2). Finally,
I will investigate whether targeting these adaptive mechanisms is a strategy to reduce desmoplasia in PDAC
without affecting matrix production in healthy tissues (Aim 3). The scientific knowledge gained from these studies
as well as my research training plan will help me to develop a unique research program and facilitate transition
into to independence, with the long-term goal to study the mechanistic basis of tumor-stroma crosstalk and to
apply this knowledge to develop therapeutic strategies that can improve outcomes of cancer patients. In addition
to my research objectives, I have outlined a detailed career development plan that will help me obtain important
skills for leading an independent research laboratory, including teaching and mentoring skills, scientific
communications, grant writing and laboratory management. I will work towards my goals under the mentorship
of Dr. Craig Thompson, a leader in cancer metabolism with a stellar track record of trainees that went on to
faculty positions. In addition, I have assembled an Advisory Committee that will collaborate and meet with me
regularly to help me perform the proposed experiments and develop into an independent researcher. This team
includes Dr. Justin Cross with expertise in metabolomics, Dr. Scott Lowe with expertise in mouse models of
cancer, Dr. Joshua Rabinowitz with expertise in studying metabolic flux in vivo, and Dr. Gina Sizemore with
expertise in studying tumor-stroma interactions. My research and career development plan, together with my
mentor, advisors and the exceptional academic environment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center will
provide a solid ground on which I can build a career as an independent investigator in cancer metabolism."
10757468,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Schizophrenia, and other disorders of the psychosis spectrum (PS), most commonly emerge throughout
development and are thought to be caused by disruptions to normative brain maturation occurring during this
time. Critically, deviations from normative neurodevelopment are thought to precede the emergence of clinically
significant PS symptoms by several years, highlighting the profound impact that their discovery would have for
psychiatry research; if we can successfully identify the antecedent brain abnormalities, then we may be able to
intervene early and reduce the risk of individuals developing schizophrenia. Uncovering these antecedent brain
abnormalities requires predictive models built upon recent advances in network neuroscience and machine
learning; moreover, such models must be coupled with large samples of longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical
data to uncover truly prognostic biomarkers. Finally, sex differences are found in both the PS symptoms and
neurodevelopment. Thus, studies that provide a precise understanding of how sex interacts with PS symptoms
and abnormal neurodevelopment are needed. The purpose of the current study is to use advanced tools from
network neuroscience and machine learning coupled with multi-modal neuroimaging to uncover biomarkers that
can predict the emergence of PS symptoms throughout development. To achieve this goal, we will draw on
multiple largescale cross-sectional and longitudinal neurodevelopmental datasets, including the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort, the Healthy Brain Network, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
study, to study brain structure and connectivity. We use Network Control Theory (NCT) to study connectivity.
NCT treats the brain as a dynamical system allowing us to probe a region's capacity to control changes in brain
states via white matter pathways. Compared to graph theory, NCT is a contemporary approach that posits an
explicit model of how the brain's structure informs and constrains its function, enabling mechanistic insight into
the dysconnectivity associated with the PS. We will quantify developmental abnormalities in NCT metrics using
a nascent machine learning technique known as normative modeling. A normative model builds a growth chart
of brain development that incorporates the expected variation in the relationship between age and the brain into
its predictions. Then, deviations from these growth charts can be understood in terms of what is and what is not
expected in a normative population. Here, we will build cross-sectional (Aim 1) and longitudinal (Aim 2)
normative models of NCT metrics and use multivariate deviations to predict PS symptoms out-of-sample. Finally,
Aim 3 will investigate the extent to which deviations from normative neurodevelopment mediate the relationship
between sex and PS symptoms. The goal of this Pathway to Independence award is to build on my strong
background in psychiatry, multimodal neuroimaging, network neuroscience, and machine learning by expanding
my expertise to developmental psychopathology, NCT, and longitudinal neuroimaging data."
10745312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cochlea acts as a nonlinear amplifier that boosts mechanical sensitivity and frequency tuning at low but
not high stimulus levels. Although cochlear responses to tones have been well studied, relatively little is known
about the dynamic (i.e., time-varying) aspects of this amplification process, such as its delays and associated
time constants. These characteristics of the amplifier are especially relevant for understanding details of how
dynamic stimuli, such as speech, are encoded by the peripheral auditory system. The proposed research
combines the complementary approaches of intracochlear vibrometry, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and
theoretical modeling to study the dynamics of nonlinear cochlear amplification in animal models. The K99
mentored research will investigate the temporal dynamics and active micromechanics of the amplifier through
in vivo vibratory measurements obtained at two locations within the organ of Corti, near the top and bottom
surfaces of the outer hair cells—the cellular motors of the cochlear amplifier. Parallel measurements of OAEs
will probe their ability to serve as noninvasive assays of the dynamical features of the amplification process.
Mathematical models will help to understand the mechanisms of the cochlear amplification delay and its role in
shaping OAEs. The R00 independent research will extend the K99-phase findings by further dissecting the
mechanisms underlying the dynamical features of cochlear amplification through studies in animals with well-
defined damage (acoustic trauma) or abnormality in cochlear structures (transgenic mice).
 These results are expected to have a high impact because they will be first to reveal the mechanisms
underlying the dynamics of cochlear amplification. By relating the OAE results to the vibrometry data in the
same animals, the work will establish the utility of OAEs as noninvasive assays of the dynamics of cochlear
processing. In the broader context, these data will provide insights into contributions of peripheral processing
to temporal phenomena of hearing that degrade with sensory hearing loss and thus will lay the necessary
groundwork for developing intervention strategies aimed at restoring auditory processing in the realistic
dynamic environments.
 The K99 phase of the proposed research will aid the candidate’s career development by introducing her to
in vivo cochlear vibrometry and by expanding her limited training in mathematical modeling. Together with her
extensive background in OAE measurements, these new skills will put the candidate in a strong position to
work independently toward her long-term goals of advancing our understanding of cochlear mechanics and
exploiting its manifestation in OAE signals to improve noninvasive tests of hearing. The University of Southern
California is an outstanding environment for the K99 research because the institution has an active hearing
neuroscience community, including the mentors, recognized experts in cochlear mechanics, and other faculty."
10745313,"Our long-term goal is to understand how glia contribute to nervous system development, function, and information processing. Glia constitute a large fraction of cells in the vertebrate nervous system and surround neuronal receptive endings to form isolated compartments. Most excitatory synapses are glia-ensheathed, as are sensory-neuron receptive endings and neuromuscular junctions. Major gaps remain in our understanding of glia. While developmental specification of some glia has been explored, programs governing astrocyte or sensory organ glia differentiation are not clear. How glia form and regulate compartments around synapses and other neuronal receptive endings is also not understood. Glia have been proposed to regulate neuronal activity, yet the effector mechanisms are not fully explored. Finally, neuron structural and functional plasticity may, in part, be under glial control, yet the details are not at hand. Thus, much remains to be learned about glial functions and their underlying molecular programs. In many animals, neurons are born in excess, and the final neuronal complement is determined in part by glial and other secreted cues controlling cell death. Glial manipulation, thus, often leads to neuronal demise. A long-standing goal has been to identify in vivo settings for studying glia-neuron interactions that bypass the neuron-survival problem. We have taken a major step towards this goal by pioneering the nematode C. elegans as a facile and relevant system for studying glia and their nervous system contributions. We showed that C. elegans possess glia, and that these ensheath sensory-neuron receptive endings, highly resembling glial structures found in vertebrate sense organs, as well as envelop the CNS, wrapping around defined synapses. Like vertebrate astrocytes, these latter glia tile, subsuming specific CNS domains, express transcription factors promoting gliogenesis in vertebrates, and express ion and neurotransmitter transporters, channels, and neurotransmitter receptors. The development of these glia bears uncanny similarities to the radial glia-to-astrocyte developmental transition in vertebrate brain development. Importantly, in C. elegans, neuron survival does not require glia, but glia manipulation results in major deficits in neuron shape and function. C. elegans therefore offers a unique in vivo arena to study glia and their effects on the nervous system. Here we aim to investigate three interrelated aspects of glia-neuron biology. (1) We will determine how astrocytic glia develop and regulate synaptic function. (2) We will determine glia guided brain assembly. (3) We will study a new cell death program resembling glia-dependent neurodegeneration. In addressing these questions, we challenge the view that only neurons underlie the phenomena under study, and posit that glia are integral regulators."
10930083,"SUMMARY
Recent clinical advances in cancer treatments have been attributed to targeting specific genes such as ER-𝛼,
HER2, etc. However, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to targeted therapies or develop
resistance over time. This implies that current methods for tumor characterization and therapeutic interventions
are not sufficiently accurate. In particular, current disease/patient subtyping approaches all look for differences
at the level of individual genes, ignoring pathway-level interactions that can hold key characteristics of cancer
disparities. The main goal of this project is to pioneer a new approach to disease/patient subtyping that
departs from the traditional paradigm: subtyping and characterization at the pathway level, using personalized
pathway profiles, rather than at the gene level. The hypothesis driving this work is that an emerging condition
for an individual patient can be triggered through different genes and molecular levels (e.g., transcriptome,
epigenome, etc.) but might involve the same mechanism(s). This is because, while alterations of impacted
genes could be very diverse between patients the pathways involved could be the same. The innovation of this
work is the development of a novel approach able to compute pathway profiles of individual patients by
effectively taking into account gene topology and pathway crosstalk. Fundamental to this approach is effective
integration of multi-omics and multi-cohort data to take advantage of complimentary information among
different data types and address the small size problem associated with many cohorts. The goal of this project
will be achieved through four specific aims: 1a) identify impacted pathways in individual patients, 1b) integrate
mutation, copy number variation, methylation, microRNA, and gene expression, 2) integrate multi-cohort data,
3) identify pathway signatures for each subtype, and 4) validate the proposed pathway-level subtyping
methodology and associated risk prediction by leveraging public data as well as data from two clinical studies
at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. The significance of the proposed work lies on its potential to provide new
methods and tools for better cancer management and prognosis. In the longer term, personalized pathway
analysis will improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and resistance to treatments, enabling the
development of new treatments for personalized medicine. The methods and tools will be made available
through an open-access web application and a CRAN R package."
10745283,"Project Abstract
The many classes of neurons in the mammalian brain use many different neurotransmitters to communicate.
Nevertheless, it has generally been assumed that each neuron uses one principal neurotransmitter. This
notion has dominated the analysis of the contributions of synaptic transmission to circuit function and behavior.
However, we and others have found that many neurons in the mammalian brain actually release several
neurotransmitters at the same time, often targeting each neurotransmitter to a specific and different
postsynaptic cell class. We propose that the co-released neurotransmitters act in concert to have consistent
and mutually reinforcing effects on their enclosing circuit. Here we propose to study the integration and
coordination of peptidergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic signaling and reveal how these diverse signaling
molecules act together to dictate the activity and plasticity state of cerebral cortex. The pathways that we have
uncovered are potentially powerful means of regulating cortical function and may, in the future, be exploited to
restore cognitive function in neurodegenerative disorders."
10745284,"Project Summary:
The cardiac thin filament is the essential regulator of cardiac contractility and relaxation at the molecular level.
It is comprised of five discrete proteins: cTnC, cTnI, cTnT, actin and tropomyosin that have co-evolved to
sustain efficient cardiac performance at rest, during exercise and, importantly, to respond to pathologic
stressors. Mutations in genes encoding each of these proteins have been definitively linked to the development
of a range of human genetic cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) forms.
Despite 25 years of study by many groups including ours, to define the direct link(s) between the biophysical
insult and the resultant complex cardiomyopathy, many questions remain and significantly limit our ability to
use genotype to prognosticate and eventually even treat individuals with genetic cardiomyopathies. The recent
development of Mavacamten, a first-in-class, targeted myosin inhibitor is a game-changing advance that was
predicated on decades of basic research into the fundamental biology of the sarcomere. Thus, the question is
no longer “if” we can target the sarcomere, but for the thin filament the question is “what function to target” and
eventually “when to treat”. The cardiac thin filament is a highly dynamic allosteric “machine” where most of the
component proteins are comprised of a-helices connected by variably sized unstructured linkers, where
dynamic flexibility is the rule, not the exception and this has limited the availability of high resolution structure
for these regions. Most of the known pathogenic mutations in cTnI and cTnT are clustered within these highly
flexible domains, where there is likely a “distribution” of tolerance, whereby mutations impair function (enough
to cause disease) but do not break it. We thus propose that by examining the range of these dynamic
perturbations within these domains we can identify new structural and dynamic disease mechanisms that can
be functionally binned, studied and modulated. We provide proof-of-principle preliminary data in this proposal.
Over the recent funding period we expanded our structural methodologies to include Time-Resolved FRET
with a Single Donor – Dual Acceptor approach that allows us to use actin as an anchor to refine highly flexible
structures. We will next use known, highly divergent (HCM vs DCM) mutations within each flexible domain to
probe both structure and dynamics with the premise that these mutations will define the limits of “tolerability” in
either direction and use spectroscopy and measurements of Ca2+ dissociation and association kinetics coupled
to computation to define and test these hypotheses. Finally, we will “close the loop” by utilizing our existing
extensively characterized transgenic animal models based on the same mutations used to set our limits and
perform 3-timepoint RNA-Seq to discover unique early transcriptional signatures to help link these
perturbations to the resultant early remodeling cascade that eventually leads to distinct patterns of ventricular
remodeling. The long term goal is to use this coupled structural – dynamic – transcriptomic platform to identify
new targets, both primary and secondary for future therapeutics and even biomarker discovery."

 This proposal describes the framework of an R01 grant for Alejandro Balazs, PhD. Dr. Balazs is
currently an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School working as a principal investigator at the Ragon
Institute of MGH, MIT & Harvard. Dr. Balazs’ research is focused on engineering the immune system via gene
transfer as a novel means of creating protection against HIV. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) show great promise in HIV prevention and therapy as they potently
neutralize a significant breadth of globally circulating HIV strains. A number of animal experiments and clinical
trials have demonstrated the ability of bNAbs to confer protection from viral challenge and reduce viremia of
established infections. BNAbs can inhibit HIV infection by blocking viral attachment or membrane fusion;
however, recent work suggests that the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of antibodies may also contribute
significantly to bNAb-mediated HIV inhibition through interactions with innate immunity. This proposal seeks to
use in vitro cell-based assays to determine the extent to which next-generation HIV bNAbs engage effector
functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular
phagocytosis (ADCP). This proposal will modify the Vectored ImmunoProphylaxis technology pioneered by Dr.
Balazs to generate sustained expression of antibodies harboring precise Fc-region mutations previously
demonstrated to enhance or abrogate, Fc-receptor interactions. By manipulating the specificity and
concentration of these antibodies, this study will define the rules governing Fc-receptor engagement that apply
to prevention of HIV acquisition. Furthermore, it seeks to determine the potential for Fc-enhanced antibodies to
increase the potency of bNAb protection against HIV transmission. Finally, this proposal will manipulate the
immune system of humanized mice as a means of dissecting and precisely quantifying the contribution of
specific immune cells to prevention of HIV transmission. Together, this work will reveal optimal epitope targets
and innate immune mechanisms to produce next-generation AAV vectors encoding bNAbs with enhanced
innate immune function to prevent HIV transmission."
10762556,"The Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS, funded initially in 2009), a VA
RR&D TBI National Network Research Center based at the VA Boston Healthcare System, with a network site
at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, intends to continue its mission of conducting multidisciplinary,
clinical research aimed at providing a multimodal psychological, biological, and neurobiological
characterization of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and deployment related stress disorders, and to use this
understanding to improve treatment for Veterans in the post-9/11 era, and ultimately for the entire population
served by the VHA. Taking a lifespan developmental approach, our carefully characterized and curated cohort
will continue to provide a wealth of insight into the complex medical and psychological problems besetting the
veterans who have entrusted us with their care. We identify four primary areas of scientific focus for TRACTS
over the next funding cycle, 2024-2029. There are a number of new projects proposed within each focus area:
Focus Area 1: Deep phenotyping of deployment trauma and its functional consequences using symptom-
based clinical presentations, molecular, genetic, and neurobiological advances from TRACTS – understanding
longitudinal pathways and trajectories to predict outcome. This central focus around investigative studies
concerned with the diagnosis and characterization of TBI, particularly concussion or mTBI as it occurs in the
context of other common deployment related comorbidities, such as PTSD, will continue leveraging newly
available longitudinal data.
Focus Area 2: Molecular and neurobiological characterization of deployment related brain trauma
using neuroimaging has been a central focus of TRACTS from its inception. Over the last decade we have
developed increasingly sophisticated approaches to study how the central nervous system is impacted by TBI
and its deployment related comorbidities in veterans. In the next funding period, we will have access to a newly
purchased Prisma 3T scanner, which will largely be devoted to research at VA Boston, that will greatly
accelerate our ability to develop new techniques in both functional and structural neuroimaging (e.g., adapting
proton density scans to examine the details of limbic and brain stem circuits, co-registration of EEG and MRI
data, MR Spectography, etc.). We will also add more sophisticated approaches to the analysis of MRI based
data in relationship to genomic and phenomic data from the TRACTS Longitudinal Cohort (TLC).
Focus Area 3: We will continue to develop innovative rehabilitative strategies to alleviate the physical and
psychological symptoms of veterans and to gain a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms of
treatment effectiveness. Of paramount importance to the TRACTS mission is to utilize the knowledge that has
been gained from the TLC to create or adapt treatment models to better support veterans’ reintegration and
adjustment after military service and to improve their functional status in their life roles (e.g., vocational,
community, and social functioning).
Focus Area 4: TRACTS will continue its support of competitive, short-term (approximately one year) projects
available to both junior and senior VA investigators for the purpose of generating pilot data to seed applications
for VA and NIH program applications supporting innovative research across the above focus areas.
The successful continuation of the proposed areas of study in TRACTS will help fill critical gaps in our
understanding of mTBI and repetitive blast and blunt exposure, and their expression in the context of a
complex neurobiological system. Collectively, the information generated will help to maximize the
psychological and neurobiological health of veterans and provide an outstanding training ground for new
investigators."

This application proposes a renewal of the Mouse Mutant Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) at The
Jackson Laboratory. Highly sophisticated genome engineering technologies, a well-characterized genome,
mammalian physiology and economical husbandry requirements make laboratory mice the mainstay of
biomedical research into disease mechanism and for disease modeling. The NIH has recognized that the
potential impact of genetically engineered mice for biomedical research cannot be fully realized without a
centralized effort to identify, archive, evaluate, characterize, and distribute valuable strains of mice to qualified
biomedical researchers. The MMRRC provides this centralized repository function. With 90 years of mouse
genetics and mouse resource experience, The Jackson Laboratory joined the MMRRC in 2009 and remains a
key member of the consortium. This proposal requests on-going support for The Jackson Laboratory as one of
the four MMRRC core repositories. As a member of the MMRRC consortium, the Jackson Laboratory will
contribute to the development and improvement of consortium-wide standard operating procedures. The
MMRRC at JAX will follow these mutually agreed upon standard operating procedures in its efforts to import,
archive (through cryopreservation of sperm and/or embryos) and distribute biomedically important strains of
mice and related materials. The MMRRC at JAX will also provide related services on a fee for service basis
and will conduct high-risk, high-return research projects that augment the overall goals of the consortium."

Systems genetics endeavors to explain the integration, coordination, and expression of genetic information
across phenotypes at all scales - molecular, cellular, physiological, and population; and across many contexts
– health, disease, infection, environment, etc. These systems-level approaches operate on networks and have
the potential to explain higher-order functions and emergent properties of biological systems. With the
explosion of -omics technologies, advanced computational methods for big data analysis, and the availability of
advanced genetic reference sequences for human and model organism populations, systems genetics
approaches are more powerful than ever. Our proposed pilot project will generate the methodologies,
capabilities, infrastructure, and proof-of-concept for an in vitro systems genetics service platform. This project
is responsive to the rising interest in systems genetics resources, a key growth area for the MMRRC

10768926,"CORE A SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This revised competing renewal Program Project Grant application entitled Discovering and Exploiting
Mechanisms of Neuroblastoma Therapy Resistance is a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional translational
research Program focused on the unmet need of improving outcomes for children with high-risk neuroblastoma.
We report significant progress towards our original scientific and clinical trial goals and report herein our
ambitious new research strategies as articulated in each Project and Core B. Together, we seek to discover
fundamental mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to both standard and newly emerging therapies.
Core A provides the experienced leadership and administrative infrastructure to define priorities, sustain
momentum, and deliver results that meet defined milestones. Thus, Core A will provide the scientific, budgetary,
and administrative leadership, as well as the programmatic infrastructure, to achieve the translational mission of
the proposed investigation across all eight leading childhood cancer research institutions. Unique to our Program
is the New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) clinical trials consortium (eleven full member sites,
six guest member sites, and expanding European membership) embedded in Core B, along with biorepository,
pathology, flow cores, and statistical expertise, to enable rapid translation of Project discoveries to our patients.
With the guidance of a world-renowned Scientific Advisory Board, Core A will continue to oversee the
development of a new generation of rationally designed therapies for children with NB that we expect to ultimately
improve cure rates, while simultaneously reducing both short- and long-term toxicities."
10775785,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The sequencing of many tens of thousands of human genomes has revealed a plethora of sequence
differences or variants. Most variants appear to be of no or little functional consequence; however, a small
fraction of these variants can alter genome regulation and the susceptibility to and prognosis of particular
diseases. Our goal is to develop and use a general and efficient approach to identify and characterize
Alzheimer-Disease-associated Variants (ADaVs) that reside in powerful transcription regulatory elements
(TREs) called enhancers, which are distributed across vast non-coding regions of the genome and can map
considerable distances from the genes that they regulate. The TREs that contain ADaVs are called here
ADaV-TREs. Our unique approach relies on our recent demonstration that divergent transcription of enhancer
RNAs (eRNAs; most sensitively detected by our PRO-cap assay) is the best mark for precisely defining active
enhancers genome-wide (generally to 300 bp or less). We focus on identifying ADaV-TREs associated with
AD, the most common cause of dementia, using the exquisitely-controlled differentiation of an
induced-pluripotent stem cell line, WTC11, to generate highly homogeneous excitatory neurons and microglia,
two of the most relevant cell types in AD. In Aim 1, we use our PRO-cap assay to identify and delimit all TREs
in this pair of CNS cell types. These TREs that overlap ADaVs, either rare variants from Whole Genome
Sequencing or common variants from Genome Wide Association Studies, provide a highly enriched set of
variants that are likely relevant to genome regulation and a particular disease, i.e., AD. In Aim 2, we examine
enhancer activity of each ADaV-TRE by high-throughput eSTARR-seq assays relative to the reference (WT)
allele. Additionally, we will assay synthetic mutations in these TREs that target and cripple specific TF motifs,
and features of core promoter pairs that direct divergent enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription, using
high-throughput mutagenesis and eSTARR-seq assays. In Aim 3, to characterize genome-wide effects of
those ADaV-TREs and synthetic mutations showing the most robust alteration in enhancer activity, we will use
CRISPR to introduce these perturbations at native loci into WTC11 cells and induce these to differentiate to
relevant CNS cell types. We will then characterize the effects of these perturbations using: 1) PRO-seq to
measure changes in genome-wide transcription at base-pair resolution; 2) chromatin conformation capture
(4C-seq) to examine changes in the 3D enhancer-promoter interaction profiles; 3) ChIP-qPCR to measure
alterations in transcription factor (TF) and co-activator binding; and 4) phenotypic assays to reveal disease
phenotypes. Our systematic and molecularly-precise analyses will identify TREs that are altered in their
regulatory activity and long-range interactions by variants, as well as the TFs and coactivators whose
association with TREs are affected. This information will be hypothesis-generating and critical for modeling
genome regulation and for dissecting molecular mechanisms of AD."
10778556,"Due to epidemics of opioid overdose and hepatitis C virus (HCV), the availability of kidneys from HCV-viremic
(HCV+) donors is increasing. There are limited numbers of HCV+ transplant candidates, and as a result 500-
1000 HCV+ donor kidneys are discarded each year. A new practice of HCV+ donor to HCV-naïve recipient
(HCV D+/R-) kidney transplantation (KT) with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has had early success. However,
there remains equipoise about whether to give DAAs as prophylaxis or as treatment post-transplant (“transmit-
and-treat”). With transmit-and-treat, HCV is cured with 8-12 weeks of DAAs, but complications such as
fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, rejection, CMV, and BK virus are reported. Prophylaxis seems to prevent these
complications but data is limited. A direct comparison of prophylaxis and transmit-and-treat has not been done.
Determining the best strategy would allow for expansion of HCV D+/R- KT and minimize clinical complications.
We propose PREVENT HCV, a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing DAA prophylaxis with
transmit-and-treat in HCV D+/R- KT. We will perform 120 HCV D+/R- KTs over 2 years at 6 transplant centers.
Aim 1 will compare the safety and efficacy of transmit-and-treat (SOF/VEL for 12 weeks starting day 14 post-
KT) vs prophylaxis (SOF/VEL for 2 weeks started several hours pre-KT). We will also measure clinical
complications of HCV D+/R- KT such as liver injury, rejection, and infection with these two strategies.
In this trial, the exact timing, size, and genetic composition of the transmitted viral inoculum will be known,
providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the earliest events in primary HCV infection. Leveraging this,
Aim 2 will characterize the earliest viral dynamics and phylogenetics of early HCV in the liver and blood, as
well as the transmitted virome, identifying emerging viruses, including SARsCoV2, some of which have been
implicated in rejection. Aim 3 will characterize the innate immune response to primary HCV, measuring
cytokines and the transcriptome of innate immune cells. These studies can contribute new knowledge about
HCV related to vaccine efforts and deeper understanding of the virome, generalizable beyond transplantation.
Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in Transplant Surgery, Infectious Diseases, Nephrology,
Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Pathology, Virology, and Immunology. Our team has experience successfully
enrolling and conducting multicenter transplantation trials (U01AI134591, U01AI138897) and will leverage
existing infrastructure for operations, data management, analysis, and safety monitoring.
In summary, PREVENT HCV will quantify clinical risks of HCV D+/R- KT and determine the optimal DAA
approach. This could facilitate thousands of additional KTs, contributing to one of the mandates of the White
House Executive Order on American Kidney Health. Finally, this trial includes unique mechanistic studies that
can generate fundamental insights into the biology of primary HCV relevant to vaccine efforts, and knowledge
about the transmitted virome and its significance in immunocompromised hosts."
10778575,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Legionella pneumophila is a intracellular bacterial pathogen that is the primary etiological agent of Legionnaires’
Disease. This disease is categorized as an atypical pneumonia that afflicts the elderly and individuals who are
immunocompromised or suffer from chronic lung disease. L. pneumophila infects host cells, such as
environmental amoeba and lung macrophages, through the secretion of an array of effector proteins that subvert
signaling pathways, membrane trafficking, and gene expression in host cells to promote bacterial replication.
Among these effectors are the protein lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) RomA and its highly conserved strain
ortholog LegAS4. RomA has been shown to localize to the nucleus where it trimethylates Lys14 in histone H3
(H3K14me3). This novel chromatin modification silences the macrophage gene expression, including loci
responsible for innate immunity. In agreement with these findings, deletion of the RomA gene in L. pneumophila
hinders bacterial replication within infected host cells, illustrating the importance of this KMT in pathogenesis.
Despite the role of RomA in L. pneumophila virulence, outstanding questions regarding the biological functions
of RomA and LegAS4 remain unresolved. These questions include the molecular basis of their unique substrate
specificity for H3K14, how they interact with chromatin, and the biological roles of LegAS4 in host cell infection.
The Trievel, Swanson, Cho, and Ohi laboratories at the University of Michigan have established an
interdisciplinary collaboration to address these questions by employing an integrated approach combining
biochemistry, microbiology, and structural biology. Our overall objective is to elucidate the mechanism by which
RomA and LegAS4 recognize and methylate H3K14 in nucleosomes in vitro and in host cells infected by L.
pneumophila. We propose the following specific aims to accomplish this objective:
 1) Define the molecular mechanism of H3K14 methylation by RomA and LegAS4.
 2) Elucidate the structural basis of nucleosome recognition.
 3) Determine the functions of LegAS4 in macrophage infection.
We envision that these studies will yield a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms
underlying nucleosome recognition and H3K14 methylation by RomA and LegAS4 that promote L. pneumophila
replication during host cell infection. These results will provide avenues for developing selective inhibitors of
these KMTs that can be applied as novel therapeutics or biocides to combat Legionnaires Disease."

Access to lung, breast, and colorectal cancer screening is low in the rural Arkansas Delta
region, resulting in disproportionate cancer mortality and low life expectancy. To reduce cancer
health disparities, the Arkansas Cancer Coalition’s Community-led Health Equity Team will
investigate how a multisectoral coalition process can lead to sustainable interventions that
reduce transportation inequities and increase demand for cancer screening in St. Francis
County. St. Francis County, located in the rural Arkansas Delta region, is ranked among the
least healthy counties in Arkansas and overall cancer mortality exceeds the national average.
The Arkansas Cancer Coalition, the only statewide coalition that aims to reduce the burden of
cancer in Arkansas, is uniquely positioned to execute a multilevel social-structural intervention
that seeks to achieve transportation equity. MAP-IT (Mobilize, Assess, Plan, Implement and
Track) and National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework will
guide the community-led local coalition’s mixed-methods needs assessment that will inform the
development and testing of a multilevel socio-structural intervention. Our novel approach seeks
to 1) change county-level transportation systems that reduce poverty, transportation, and time
burdens; 2) leverage regular access to mobile breast and lung cancer screening units; 3) work
with partners to change policies to expand the reach of fecal immunochemical test screening
and colonoscopy follow-up; and 4) work with health systems to build a sustainable reminder
infrastructure that increases screening demand in rural areas. This project could have a
significant impact on reducing the cancer burden on rural, underserved, poor and Black/African
American people."
10762416,"The world is rapidly heading towards a pre-1940’s scenario when it comes to fighting infectious disease.
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem on a global scale, greatly hampering our abilities to quell worldwide
epidemics such as influenza, SARS, COVID-19, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as the simple staphylococcus
infection. Unless innovative strategies are developed to produce robust and effective new classes of antibiotics,
health care costs will continue to climb and we will completely lose our ability to combat even the most common
infection. Influenza and coronavirus (SARS and COVID-19) create an even more urgent need for targeting
resistant bacteria related to lung infections, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a common
example of CRE being Klebsiella Pneumoniae (KP). Recent article by J. Gerberding, former CDC director states
“The patients at greatest risk from superbugs like CRE and other bacterial pathogens that cause lung diseases,
are the ones who are already more vulnerable to illness from viral lung infections like influenza, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for example, claimed nearly
300,000 lives around the world. Many of those deaths — between 29% and 55% — were actually caused
by secondary bacterial pneumonia, according to the CDC.” A recent study (Zhou, Lancet 2020, 395, 1054-1062)
from Wuhan reports that almost 50% of COVID-19 related deaths showed evidence of secondary bacterial
infections (pneumonia, sepsis, bloodstream infections).
Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to 2-3 classes), extensive drug resistance (XDR, resistance to
most classes except colistin or tigecycline) and even pan drug resistance (PDR, resistance to all classes)
nosocomial bacterial infections have skyrocketed in recent years, and the emergence of pan drug-resistant
isolates are making these infections increasingly difficult to treat. Hospital-acquired infections like these account
for up to 4% of all hospital stays in the United States and are incredibly diverse in causative pathogen, antibiotic
resistance profile, and severity. A significant cause of nosocomial infection is the Enterobacteriaceae family,
which includes Gram-negative bacilli that can be commensal or pathogenic. Enterobacteriaceae have a
widespread clinical and economic impact due to the diversity of infections they cause; this family causes many
infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and intra-abdominal
infections (IAIs). The World Health Organization (WHO) lists carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
as having a critical need for novel antibiotics on their Priority Pathogens list. Because the mortality of these multi
drug-resistant infections is between 30 and 50% and there is such difficulty in finding viable treatments, the need
for novel therapeutics for these pathogens must be addressed.
One of the challenges of research in infectious diseases is to find ways to use the increasing knowledge of the
mechanisms underlying disease biology, transformation and progression to develop novel therapeutic strategies
targeting MDR, XDR, and PDR bacterial infections. Targeting heavily conserved RNA sequences and structures,
present in the 4 billion years old bacterial ribosome, and involved in proliferation and survival of bacteria, is a
promising approach. RNA, the essential nucleic acid component of the ribosome, is a validated target for drug
design, both as therapeutic and as a target. We will target specific rRNA single strands, which are conserved
across prokaryotes, essential for translation initiation but absent in eukaryotes, ensuring that a drug targeting
this sequence can function as a broad spectrum therapeutic. In the proposed work, we will construct sequence-
specific chemically modified rRNA targeting oligomers that can be effectively delivered inside the cell. Short RNA
will be exploited as target for synthetic molecules that inactivate the functioning of the ribosome, stopping
bacterial protein synthesis and causing bacterial death. NUBAD’s unique experimental approaches and
technologies will allow us to target rRNA combinations not previously explored for susceptibility against bacteria.
The work proposed is a multidisciplinary effort encompassing solid-phase organic synthesis, oligonucleotide
stability and delivery, RNA targeted screening, antimicrobial activity, ADME TOX, and in vivo efficacy studies
describes the development of sequence-specific cell permeable binders of rRNA. The success of the proposed
work would be a significant addition to currently available ribosome-specific approaches in drug development.
We propose using a small rRNA target sequence, heavily conserved in prokaryotes, to design conjugates that
can be employed to inhibit microbial growth, opening possibilities for developing sequence-specific RNA targeted
therapeutics. This work addresses an important world health issue, antimicrobial resistance, and presents
creative steps towards a novel solution to this problem."
10762421,"Project Summary
The highly specialized intestinal immune system is charged with maintaining tolerance to harmless stimuli from
commensal bacteria and food, while providing protective immunity against pathogens. Dysregulation of this
critical balance can lead to inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy, or increased susceptibility to enteric
pathogens. CD4+ T cells are key players in intestinal homeostasis, finely tuning responses at the level of antigen
recognition and functional differentiation. In the intestinal epithelium (IE) and underlying lamina propria (LP),
tissue adapted pro-inflammatory (ie. Th17, Th1) and regulatory (Treg) and intraepithelial (CD8aa+ CD4IEL) CD4+
T cells coordinate immunity and tolerance to diverse intestinal stimuli. Nevertheless, it remains to be defined
how TCR repertoire and its specificity translate to function of both LP and IELs in response to microbial antigens.
Additionally, very little is known about the characteristics of dietary antigen-specific intestinal T cells. Oral
tolerance, a critical mechanism of gut homeostasis whereby oral administration of antigen results in both local
and systemic tolerance to that antigen, is known to depend on Tregs. However, the clonal dynamics of polyclonal
T cell responses in the setting of tolerance remain unclear. Finally, outside the context of immunization or allergy,
T cells that specifically recognize food protein have yet to be identified. Based on data recently published as well
as preliminary data obtained during the current funding cycle, we hypothesize that tissue cues combined with
TCR-driven signals from commensal microbes and food dictate intestinal T cell functional differentiation in steady
state, while disruption of normal T cell responses by infections or allergens results in inappropriate clonal
dynamics including expansion of pathological T cells. Aim 1 will define how stimulation by microbiota or enteric
viruses impact TCR repertoire and functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 T cells. Aim 2 will characterize the
role of dietary antigens in the context of tolerance, enteric infections, or food allergy, affect TCR repertoire and
functional differentiation of intestinal CD4 T cells. We combine single cell transcriptomics with a novel fate-
mapping strategy to selectively label peripheral T cells that are recruited to the intestine under various microbial
and dietary challenges. A recently developed LIPSTIC tool that allows intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) labeling
of interacting cells will be utilized to define potential mechanisms of IEL recruitment/expansion in response to
nonself stimuli. Recently generated murine strains with fixed TCR Vb chain, or that carry microbiota-specific
TCRs, combined with complementary tetramer and gnotobiotic strategies will be used to specifically track and
define recognition properties during T cell migration and differentiation in the gut. Novel “super-tetramer” and
dietary manipulations, combined with inflammatory challenges will be used to define food antigen-specific T cells
during steady state and how intestinal CD4+ T cell responses to dietary antigen are altered in a food allergic or
infection context. By combining these innovative approaches and concepts in mucosal immunology, this proposal
will help better defining the role of nonself antigen stimulation in T cell repertoire and function in the intestine."
10762983,"With no effective therapy to date, the ongoing Type 1 diabetes (T1D) epidemic continues to be a major health
problem. While immune therapeutics hold great promise for the treatment of T1D, their inadequacy, serious
toxicity, side effects, and morbidity have limited research efforts in the lifelong immunosuppression approach.
This shortcoming has prompted investigators to search for alternative approaches. Targeted nanomedicine
using polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) holds particular promise to enhance the delivery of immune therapeutics
to treat T1D. This strategy can minimize the undesirable side effects of immune therapeutics by delivering
them to diseased tissues, where they can undergo sustained release. In this multidisciplinary project, we aim to
develop an innovative, targeted nanodelivery method for immune therapeutics for T1D. Although progress has
been made in developing new formulations, a method of targeted delivery of NPs to specific tissue sites
following systemic administration remains to be developed. The priming and activation of autoreactive T cells
occurs in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs), where naive T cells enter through lymph node (LN)-restricted
vasculature known as high endothelial venules (HEVs) and encounter autoantigens from the pancreas
presented by dendritic cells. Activated T cells traffic subsequently to the pancreas, causing insulitis and
autoimmune diabetes. Notably, we have found that HEVs are also formed in the pancreas during the onset of
diabetes in NOD mice. Here, for the first time, we have developed a nanodelivery of therapeutics to PLN and
Pancreata of NOD mice targeting HEV with intra venous injection. We have generated a novel mAb and scFV
against the peripheral node addressin (PNAd), a glycoprotein family expressed only by endothelial cells of the
HEV. We also provide human data that supports the clinical applicability of our delivery platform. Moreover, our
preliminary data shows that delivery of anti-CD3 antibody using our HEV targeted unprecedently increases the
efficacy of anti CD3 in suppressing autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. Our main hypothesis is that targeted
delivery of anti-CD3 to the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and pancreata will increase its efficacy and
decrease toxicity by reducing systemic dosing significantly. In Aim 1, we will examine and optimize the
stability, binding efficacy, and biodistribution of anti HEV mAb-conjugated NPs in NOD mice. In Aim 2, we will
assess the clinical efficacy and the mechanisms by which the delivery of anti-CD3 using anti HEV mAb-
conjugated NPs reverse autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. In Aim 3, we plan to test the binding capacity to
the PLNs and pancreata of human T1D patients of our optimized anti HEV mAb-conjugated NPs. This
multidisciplinary, collaborative approach will lay the groundwork for the introduction of an innovative, targeted
delivery method of immune therapeutics for T1D."

Background. Latino adolescents have higher prevalence of alcohol consumption and binge drinking, start using
drugs and alcohol earlier, and are at greater risk of developing addiction due to early use. It has been well
documented that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), such as abuse and neglect, significantly increase the
risk for alcohol misuse. ACEs also affect HPA axis functioning and alter cortisol levels that can lead to mental
health problems and alcohol use. More recently, epigenetic studies have uncovered that methylation of HPA axis
genes affect cortisol levels and increase the risk for alcohol use disorder. More integrative research is needed
to understand how biological and environmental factors interact to increase the vulnerability for alcohol misuse.
Research Strategy. To obtain a more nuanced understanding of mechanisms leading to alcohol misuse, we
hypothesize influences at the psychological (traumatic stressors), biological (genetics, endocrine), interpersonal
(family cohesion), and cultural (values) level and identify paths of risk and resilience. The current project will
assess the impact of ACEs on alcohol abuse and identify relevant protective factors (aim 1), evaluate the role of
HPA axis functioning (hair cortisol) in the ACEs-alcohol misuse link and identify relevant protective factors (aim
2), and explore epigenetic mechanisms (saliva DNA methylation) linking ACEs and HPA axis functioning (hair
cortisol; aim 3). The proposed study will leverage the structure and resources of the candidate primary mentor’s
parent R01 and select a subsample of Latino adolescents (N= 150), for stress biomarkers collection (i.e., hair
cortisol, saliva DNA methylation). Data yielded from the proposed study will lead to a future R01 examining the
contribution of childhood adversities on biological vulnerabilities for alcohol use disorders longitudinally. Training
Plan. In coordination with the research plan, the candidate will pursue training in the following three areas: (1)
obtain training on alcohol epidemiology and etiology as a foundation to developing addiction prevention research
with racial/ethnic minorities, (2) gain knowledge of epigenetics via DNA methylation, particularly in HPA axis and
alcoholism-related genes, and (3) train in statistical genetics. Mentorship. Dr. Alegría is an expert in health and
substance use disparities with extensive experience in mentoring early career investigators. Co-mentor Dr.
Shields provides expertise on adversity-related epigenetics among minorities, co-mentor Dr. Zhang provides
expertise in epigenetic influences in alcohol use disorders, and co-mentor Dr. Becker provides expertise in
alcohol addiction among adolescents. A team of advisors provides additional expertise in biostatistics modeling
of longitudinal data (Dr. Spiegelman) and in the impact of adversity on child endocrinology (Dr. Valentino).
Candidate. The candidate is an early career scientist and clinical psychologist with extensive health disparities
research experience. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K08
award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a
leading expert in biopsychosocial influences in minority addiction and health."

Almost one-third of all oncology patients experience financial hardship (FH) related to their cancer care costs.
People who experience FH have worse health outcomes, early mortality, increased stress, and decreased
quality of life (QOL). Cancer patients living in rural areas are disproportionately affected by FH due to structural
and individual level social determinants of health (SDOH) that are associated with living in a rural area, and
more cancer survivors in rural areas report FH than their urban counterparts. However, little is known about the
unique experience of FH for rural populations. The cost and the chronicity of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
treatment generates an ideal group to study to better understand the experience of FH. Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitors (TKIs) have incredibly extended life expectancy of CML patients, but these drugs can be extremely
costly and usually are taken indefinitely. This results in risk for FH, nonadherence, and potential poor health
outcomes. Further exploration of the experience of FH is needed to inform rural specific interventions to reduce
the risk of FH and health inequities for this population. The purpose of this project is to explore the experience
of FH for people with CML who live in rural areas of the Southeast. This project will also explore healthcare
team member perceptions of the FH experience for rural CML patients. Information from both patients and
healthcare team members supporting rural patients (such as nurses, pharmacists, financial navigators, and
social workers) is needed to better identify current practices, gaps in care, and to inform interventions to
reduce FH and health inequities for rural populations. A qualitative descriptive approach will be used to elicit
deep description of experiences and perceptions. Approximately 25 participants with CML who are taking a
TKI, living in a rural southeastern 4+ Rural-Urban Continuum Code county, and experiencing FH as measured
by the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST), and approximately 10 healthcare team members
who care for rural CML patients in the Southeast will be recruited. Data will be collected by semi-structured in-
depth interviews. The first aim for this study is to explore the experience of FH in people with CML who live in
rural areas by a) describing the impact of cancer care costs on material conditions, psychological responses,
and coping behaviors related to financial hardship and b) exploring unique aspects of living in a rural area as
they relate to financial hardship of cancer care. The second aim for this study is to explore healthcare staff
perceptions of the FH experience for CML patients who live in rural areas by a) describing how structural and
individual level risk factors impact FH for the rural CML population and b) describe strategies and resources
currently available in clinical settings, areas of need to relieve FH, and recommend intervention strategies to
address FH in rural areas. This study will address a gap in the literature for an at-risk population that is
challenged by the costs of cancer care while providing evidence that will lead to rural specific interventions to
reduce the risk of FH and improve health outcomes and QOL for rural cancer patients."

Adverse birth outcomes in infants affect health over the life course, and preeclampsia and postpartum
depression contribute significantly to maternal morbidity and mortality. Neighborhood deprivation and
discrimination are associated with these adverse perinatal outcomes and their disparities, but it is difficult to
develop interventions to limit these harmful exposures. Research suggests that social support is a modifiable
characteristic that can buffer against the adverse effects of maternal stress on some birth outcomes, but less is
known about its potential to buffer the effects of neighborhood deprivation and discrimination on perinatal
outcomes. Aim 1 will evaluate the degree to which prenatal social support modifies the effect of neighborhood
deprivation on adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age.
Aim 2 will examine the degree to which prenatal social support modifies the effect of neighborhood deprivation
on preeclampsia. Aim 3 will investigate the degree to which postnatal social support modifies the effect of
discrimination on postpartum depression. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-
Be multi-site cohort of 9,289 pregnancies will be used for Aims 1 and 2. In this cohort, neighborhood
deprivation was measured by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and social support was measured by the
Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The Community and Child Health Network
multi-site cohort of 2,510 pregnancies will be used for Aim 3. In this cohort, discrimination was measured by
the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS), postnatal social support was measured by the Medical Outcomes
Study (MOS) Social Support Scale, and postpartum depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale (EPDS) at 1, 6, and 12 months postpartum. The hypothesis is that the adverse effects of
neighborhood deprivation and discrimination on perinatal outcomes will be diminished among women with high
perceived social support compared to women with low perceived social support and secondarily that this
buffering effect will differ by racial group and by type of social support. Our findings could help inform the value
of psychosocial risk screening in prenatal care to assist in identifying pregnant women most likely to benefit
from resources such as support groups, insurance-covered doulas, and new interventions developed with a
nuanced understanding of which types of social support are most effective and for which outcomes. The
planned research and training goals will enrich the applicant’s rigorous training in advanced epidemiologic
methods, psychosocial epidemiology, perinatal health disparities, and prenatal clinical care, as well as provide
professional development in preparation for her transition to a postdoctoral fellowship. Equipped with a strong
mentoring team and Emory’s rich training environment, this fellowship will provide a strong foundation for the
applicant’s long-term goal of leading an independent research program that focuses on the mental and
psychosocial health of women who enter pregnancy, within the context of their broader social environments."

The goal of this project is to determine the effect of prenatal folate status on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
establishment and function. The Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis purports that
many adult-onset diseases originate during perinatal development. This phenomenon of developmental
programming of disease has since been demonstrated to be mediated at least in part by epigenetic changes
during development, as these effects also occur trans-generationally. Folic acid is a major nutritional component
that regulates cellular methylation and epigenetic patterning during fetal life, and prenatal folate deficiency is
independently associated with failure of neural tube closure. Population-wide folic acid fortification is used in
many parts of the world for the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), as approximately 70% of NTDs are
prevented by folate supplementation. We will test the hypothesis that varying prenatal folate status programs
risk for adult-onset disease by altering hematopoietic stem cell function and consequent immune trajectory from
the developmental stage onwards. In this grant we propose that heterogeneity, function, and output of the adult
HSC compartment can be shaped by perturbation during early development. Our previous work on the effects
prenatal inflammation on the developing hematopoietic system show evidence that perturbation during early
development can influence adult hematopoiesis and immune function. We will then apply this idea to test the
effects of varying prenatal folate on hematopoietic establishment. Proliferation, genomic stability, and cell
methylation are all processes influenced by folate-mediated OCM and are known to impact HSC establishment
and function. We believe that early life alterations in folate-mediated OCM are likely to influence long-term HSC
function. The underlying question of how maternal nutrition influences stem cell outcomes is underexplored. Our
preliminary data shows that exposure to varying prenatal folate results in alterations in HSC establishment.
Additionally, our model of prenatal folate metabolically reprograms HSCs during fetal life that persist into
adulthood with altered function. These changes are in part driven by differences in metabolic gene expression.
By examining how prenatal folate alters HSC function, we will be one of the first labs to directly identify the effects
of maternal nutrition on health consequences by affecting the establishment and function of HSCs. In addition to
the research statement contained within, I have developed a training plan that I believe will ensure my success
across all aspects of the proposed research plan. The training plan I have developed not only addresses the
training needs that are specific to this proposal but also builds on my interests that will give me tools to investigate
metabolic programming, integrate “omics” datasets and stitch together multiple fields related to public health.
This training plan includes training specific to metabolism and bioinformatic analysis, as well as career
development skills such as mentorship focus, writing skills and presentation skills and academic professionalism.
All of the research contained in this proposal will take place in the Beaudin Lab at the University of Utah."
10884210,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity increases the risk of cancer; thus, individuals that are obese are more likely to undergo chemotherapy
in their lifetime. However, there is a dearth of literature on the impact of weight status on cancer patient life
quality and functional capacity throughout treatment. For instance, our knowledge of the impact of obesity on
cancer and chemotherapy-induced cachexia - the unintentional loss of lean mass, which directly contributes to
functional dependency, poor treatment outcomes, and decreased survival – is incomplete. An “obesity
paradox” has been postulated; however, the epidemiology remains equivocal on the benefits/detriments of a
high pre-treatment body weight and body mass index. While obesity and cachexia are diseases at opposite
ends of the weight spectrum, these pathologies share some underlying perturbations (e.g. mitochondrial
dysfunction) that may exacerbate functional decrements when these morbidities co-occur. Our lab made the
novel and significant discovery that obese mice, dosed for lean mass, were unable to survive 2-3 cycles of the
chemotherapeutic, 5 fluorouracil (5FU). Indeed, contrary to what has been suggested, we discovered that
obese mice are not protected against chemotherapy-induced cachexia and show exacerbated skeletal muscle
toxicities. Disruptions to mitochondria are 1) central to chemotherapy-induced skeletal muscle mass loss, and
2) are known to be existent with obesity and metabolic dysfunction; however, mitochondrial dysfunction and
resultant functional deficits have not been assessed when these morbidities co-occur. Antioxidants have been
shown to improve mitochondrial function. Indeed, we have shown that the antioxidant dietary compound,
quercetin, can reduce cancer, cancer cachexia, and chemotherapy-induced fatigue, and can increase
mitochondrial function in healthy mice. Thus, quercetin may hold promise as a dietary strategy to treat
cachexia associated with cancer and its therapies in the obese condition. The primary goal of my proposed
F31 is to 1) understand the impact of obesity on 5FU-induced skeletal muscle dysfunction and 2) provide
mechanistic and therapeutic insights aimed at better improving 5FU tolerance with obesity. My central
hypothesis is that 5FU-induced mitochondrial loss and dysfunction is exacerbated with an obese phenotype
and intervening with quercetin will mitigate the deleterious effects of 5FU on skeletal muscle. To test this
hypothesis, I propose three related but independent specific aims: 1) Examine the impact of obesity on cancer
and 5FU-induced cachexia and function loss; 2) Determine the role of mitochondria in obesity-exacerbated
5FU toxicities; and 3) Explore the utility of dietary quercetin on improving 5FU treatment tolerance and off-
target toxicities with obesity. The proposed studies align with my training aims and will provide me with the
opportunity to gain expertise in obesity phenotyping and natural compounds as therapeutics, mitochondrial
health and dynamics, cachexia and functional testing. Further, the professional development training will
promote advancement to the next step in my path to research independence."

The proposed R00 phase of this project will take place in the Wells Laboratory, which opened in September 2021 as part of the Department of Human Genetics in the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles. Recent reports estimate that 1 out of every 6 children in the United States meet the diagnostic criteria for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability (ID). The prevalence of ASDs, which are characterized by persistent social impairments, language deficits, and repetitive behaviors, has increased by 120% over the past 15 years, a problem further exacerbated by the fact that the disease mechanisms underlying ASDs are largely unknown and no targeted therapeutic interventions exist. Recent progress in human genome sequencing has begun to illuminate pathways to disease through the identification of several genetic risk factors, the most common of which is the deletion of 16p11.2 locus (16p11.2del). Initial studies have nominated specific genes in the 16p11.2 locus in neuronal dysfunction. This proposal aims to elucidate the disease mechanisms underlying 16p11.2del phenotypes using in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human brain cells. In the first aim, we will attempt to identify the 16p11.2 genes contributing to disease-relevant molecular and phenotypic defects using a pooled CRISPR activation approach in a neural progenitor cell village composed of dozens of patient and neurotypical control lines. In the second aim, we will assess and rescue abnormal molecular and cellular responses to major signaling pathway activation in a village of patients and controls. The successful completion of these aims could lead to the identification of genetic targets for therapeutic intervention, while also dramatically changing the way the field conducts in vitro modeling of human brain disorders."
10745682,"Project Summary/Abstract
Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative infections pose a serious threat to human health. The outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria is a unique structure essential for survival; it also functions as a physical barrier to block
entry of many classes of antibiotics, thereby rendering them ineffective. At present, colistin is the only antibiotic
active against many resistant Gram-negative infections, but it has dose-limiting toxicity. We have discovered that
the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin and analogs with no gyrase activity potentiate the activity of colistin. Based
on genetic, structural, and biochemical data, we propose that they do so by binding to and activating the inner
membrane lipopolysaccharide transport complex. The inner membrane complex uses the energy of ATP
hydrolysis by a cytoplasmic ATPase (LptB) to extract lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane and move it
onto a protein bridge that spans the periplasm to the outer membrane. We have shown that novobiocin binds at
the interface between LptB and LptFG, the transmembrane components of the transporter. We have also shown
that another component of the transporter, LptC, couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to LPS extraction from
the membrane. We propose experiments to better understand how LptC coordinates ATP hydrolysis with LPS
extraction because this information is integral to understanding how novobiocin activates the machine. We also
propose to develop new assays to quantify binding of novobiocin analogs and to monitor machine dynamics. We
will apply these assays to characterize new synthetic analogs of novobiocin. Our objective is to identify
compounds that strongly activate the transport machine while retaining gyrase activity. We will test compounds
for synergy with colistin to test the hypothesis that strong activation of the transport machine is required for good
synergy. This work may lead to development of safer colistin-based therapies to treat Gram-negative infections.
In addition, the fundamental knowledge obtained about how this transporter works could enable discovery of
other classes of compounds that interfere with its function."
10883640,"Project Summary
 The hippocampus has considerable importance for memory and emotion, and it is a major site of
pathophysiology associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. One striking feature of this brain
region is its unique capacity for adult neurogenesis, a process by which new neurons are continuously generated
from radial neural stem cells (rNSCs) throughout life in the dentate gyrus (DG). These adult-born neurons (ABNs)
undergo a critical period of heightened synaptic plasticity, during which they make unique contribution to
hippocampus-dependent behavior. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is dynamically regulated by neural
circuit activity. However, a long-standing question remains on whether manipulating neural circuits can induce
sufficient neurogenic effects for behavioral modulation. Recently, we identified a key subcortical region in the
hypothalamus, supramammillary nucleus (SuM), which upon activation effectively promote AHN. Specifically,
patterned stimulation of SuM neurons promotes self-renewal and neurogenic proliferation of rNSCs and
maturation of ABNs, which collectively contributes to increased production of ABNs with improved properties.
Importantly, chemogenetic manipulation of the activity of these SuM-enhanced ABNs bidirectionally modulates
memory performance and innate anxiety. These results highlight activity-dependent contribution of SuM-
enhanced ABNs in hippocampal function. Interestingly, SuM neurons are highly responsive to environmental
novelty (EN) and are required for EN-induced enhancement of neurogenesis. Building upon these findings, we
propose the following aims to decipher mechanisms underlying SuM-mediated modulation of AHN and activity-
dependent contribution of SuM-enhanced ABNs to brain-wide network dynamics. Aim 1 will determine the
contribution of SuM glutamate or GABA transmission in mediating SuM-activity or environmental-novelty induced
enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis. Aim 2 will determine the functional properties of SuM-enhanced
ABNs and molecular regulators underlying SuM-mediated enhancement of neurogenesis. Aim 3 will determine
activity-dependent contribution of SuM-enhanced ABNs to local hippocampal circuit and brain-wide network
dynamics."
10850801,"Why some people develop Multiple Sclerosis and others do not, despite similar genetic risk and quantities of
circulating autoreactive lymphocytes, is not known. Our long-term goal is to identify environmental triggers of
MS, define the molecular and cellular basis of their action, and in doing so, propose new diagnostic tools and
therapeutic targets. The objectives of this proposal are to determine mechanistically how Clostridium
perfringens epsilon toxin (ETX) and Bordetella pertussis toxin (PTX) overcome CNS immune privilege to trigger
autoimmunity in the context of myelin autoreactive lymphocytes and to understand why ETX causes lesions to
develop in the forebrain, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord in contrast to PTX where lesions are more
commonly localized to the spinal cord. The central hypothesis of this project is that ETX and PTX trigger CNS
autoimmunity by inducing critical dysfunction at CNS barriers necessary for entry of pathogenic lymphocytes.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims: 1) Determining the effect of cell specific deletion or
introduction of the ETX receptor MAL (Myelin and Lymphocyte Protein) in active immunization models of
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), compare the neuroanatomical location, phenotype, and
activation state of immune infiltrates between PTX- and ETX-induced EAE, and explore the effect of ETX on
human lymphocytes, and 2) Determine the genes induced and suppressed in CNS-endothelial cells by ETX and
PTX and define their function in overcoming CNS immune privilege through loss-of-function strategies. We will
pursue these aims using an innovative combination of targeted genetic mutations to isolate cellular and
molecular targets of ETX required to induce disease. We will use confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry,
high dimensional flow cytometry, and unbiased sampling of the entire CNS to compare the effects of ETX with
PTX on immune phenotype, demyelination, and neuroanatomic localization of lesions. To determine toxin
induced genes functioning to overcome CNS immune privilege, we will apply a combination of unbiased mRNA
profiling techniques to CNS endothelial cells isolated from different neuroanatomic regions, advanced
bioinformatics to define relevant gene modules, immunohistochemistry to validate localization of these induced
proteins within individual post-capillary venules, and conditional loss-of-function mutations in endothelial cells
to determine function. The rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will define the role by which a
toxin, clinically associated with MS, functions in the multi-step process of autoimmunity, and will identify key
molecular targets that can be tested therapeutically. This work will also help establish an experimental model
that has greater clinical relevance to MS and more closely resembles MS neuropathology than experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis models reliant on pertussis toxin."
10928790,"Abstract The overall goal of UCSF’s Clinical and Translational Research Innovation in Dental School (ClinTrain-RIDeS) is to develop future dentist-scientists and establish a clinical research enterprise at the UCSF School of Dentistry and Northern California through the following aims: 1) Provide clinical research training and skills development to UCSF Dentistry’s community of clinicians (predoctoral students, postgraduate residents, faculty) and to other collaborating partners – UCSF Dentistry- a􀆯iliated clinical faculty from Community-Based Clinical Education externship sites in California and Alaska and clinical faculty at California Northstate University College of Dental Medicine. The successful training programs and courses from the UCSF Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) will be adapted and tailored for School of Dentistry residents and faculty, and dental research faculty will facilitate small group sessions to provide mentoring on developing a clinical research protocol. For predoctoral students, the existing research methods curriculum required of all dental students will be redesigned to expand clinical research topics and a new quality improvement course will be developed. Dental students will also be supported to participate in CTSI’s Yearlong Inquiry Program and obtain a certificate/master’s in clinical research degree. 2) Develop a Practice-based Clinical Research Incubator Program at the UCSF Dental Center to foster conducting clinical research studies by building and expanding on e􀆯ective mentorship and sponsorship initiatives at UCSF and in the School of Dentistry. Mentoring will be available to trainees in all phases of designing and implementing their clinical research including forming project ideas, developing them into protocols, applying for intramural funds, implementing research, and disseminating findings. 3) Conduct small-scale practice-based clinical research projects prospectively collecting data, starting with (a) validating the accuracy and adherence to evidence-based treatment guidelines of artificial intelligence (AI)- generated caries diagnoses and treatment plans compared to faculty-approved student-dentist diagnoses and treatment plans with assistance from UCSF’s APeX-Enabled Research Program and leading industry partners (Retrace.ai); and (b) assessing the usability of a real-time dental AI clinical decision support tool among predoctoral student-dentists and clinical faculty. Future small-scale research projects will be clinical faculty generated and prioritized based on observations from their daily clinical practices. Together these aims will catalyze UCSF to be a leader in practice-based clinical research in Northern California dental schools, which have a diverse patient base permitting favorable generalizability and applicability of findings."
10928818,"Meharry Medical College (MMC) is a historically black college that routinely oversees the healthcare needs of
underserved populations and patients with low socioeconomic status inflicted with multiple medical and dental
comorbidities. The majority of our School of Dentistry (SOD) students and residents are from underrepresented
minority groups. At the MMCSOD clinics, they serve patients of low socioeconomic backgrounds, many of whom
are underinsured or uninsured. Therefore, MMCSOD is uniquely positioned to provide the clinical training
required to serve underserved patient populations. Unfortunately, only a small number of MMCSOD graduates
thus far, if any, have become dentist-scientists. This could be due to the lack of sufficient research training in the
clinical setting. Implementing a) clinical research skills development through research education and b) practice-
based approach research at MMCSOD will enhance the critical thinking skills necessary to incorporate the
acquired knowledge into best practices among our trainees. Furthermore, it will boost the graduation of more
competent dental scientists. We aim to engage our pre-doctoral, post-doctoral residents and dental faculty
(trainees) in a multidisciplinary project that will allow them to gain research skills and experience while treating
underserved patients at the MMCSOD clinics. To enhance clinical research and multidisciplinary practice-based
research skills among trainees, we will a) implement evidence based clinical research courses and training; b)
leverage intra-institutional collaborations with Meharry Schools of Medicine, Graduate Studies and Applied
Computational Sciences and inter-institutional collaborations with Vanderbilt University Medical Center; and c)
enhance peer and student mentoring partnerships with faculty focused on clinical research. We will implement
“Clinical Research Immersion Program” with the support of Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA).
The trainees will evaluate the program at the end of their rotation. Our trainees will also conduct clinical chart
reviews, case study sessions, collect and process oral specimens, and perform critical appraisal of the literature.
Collectively, this will boost our trainees to acquire the clinical research experience in treating periodontal disease
(PD) and HIV patients because of the high incidences of these diseases among the patients they see. They will
learn about and apply omics analysis in the identification of biomarkers for increased PD risk. They will also learn
to correlate their patients’ microbiological and immunological profiles with the severity and activity of PD. The
multidisciplinary practice-based research opportunities will enhance the clinical training of minority trainees at
MMCSOD. Our proposed training program will ultimately help improve the overall community/public health
outcomes for underserved populations affected by PD and HIV."

Pregnant and postpartum women who are Black live at the intersection of three of the gravest public health
threats confronting the 21st century US: (1) the maternal morbidity and mortality epidemic; (2) the behavioral
health crisis; and (3) intersectional discrimination. In a nation with the highest maternal mortality rate of all
high-income countries, Black women are three times more likely to die while pregnant or postpartum than their
White counterparts. Maternal behavioral health conditions – such as anxiety, perinatal and postpartum
depression, and birth-related PTSD – are the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth,
affecting 1 in 5 women, and disproportionately afflict Black women. Overdoses, substance use disorders, and
related harms are surging among Black women. According to maternal mortality review committees (MMRCs),
behavioral health conditions are one of the leading causes of maternal deaths and are the leading
preventable cause of maternal deaths. Despite their size and impact, the US is ill prepared to mobilize to
address these crises because of longstanding legacies of intersectional discrimination whereby behavioral
health problems are neglected within the field of maternal health and the field of behavioral health neglects
maternal health. Black women in particular have suffered: historically and presently, approaches to address
Black maternal mortality and behavioral health have systematically failed to engage communities with lived
experience. Led by a partnership of Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory, and a robust network of
community-based organizations, and guided by principles of Reproductive Justice, Research Justice, and the
NIMHHD Mental Health framework, the Center to Advance Reproductive Justice and Behavioral Health among
Black pregnant/postpartum women (CORAL) will generate actionable evidence about the multilayered
determinants of maternal behavioral health conditions in close and equitable partnerships with Black women,
and the community-based organizations that serve them, with the goal of ending the maternal behavioral
health crisis in Georgia and beyond. Georgia is an essential site for this work as it has among the highest
pregnancy-related mortality ratios in the US, and Black women experience a rate that is 2.3 times that of White
women. The state MMRC has found that behavioral health conditions are a leading – and growing – cause of
maternal death. Leveraging an outstanding infrastructure spanning 2 major universities and a strong network of
community organizations, CORAL will mobilize academic and community partners to support Black maternal
behavioral health by developing and sustaining a robust transdisciplinary community-drive research
infrastructure; conducting rigorous, ethical transdisciplinary research in partnership with communities; building
the capacity of the next generation of investigators; and collaborating with academic, governmental, and
community to disseminate and translate discoveries."

Liver transplantation is the only definitive therapy for end-stage liver disease. A significant pool of liver donors
comes from donation after cardiac death (DCD). The challenge with DCD donors is the prolonged warm
ischemia that can result in significant liver dysfunction, thus leading to the development of early allograft
dysfunction (EAD) or even primary non-function (PNF) in the recipient. Development of a therapeutic agent to
preserve DCD liver donor integrity would have significant therapeutic value in reducing EAD/PNP during or
after a liver transplant. Previously we identified MG53 as an essential component of cell membrane repair. In
this proposal, we present promising data to support the scientific premise that muscle-liver crosstalk via MG53
as a myokine constitutes an integral part of hepatocellular protection. While the liver does not express
endogenous MG53 protein, MG53 can translocate from circulation to target injured hepatocytes during the
acute phase of hepatic injury. Biochemical and live cell imaging studies revealed that MG53 can interact with
MLKL to preserve hepatocellular integrity. Using the normothermic ex-vivo liver perfusion (NEVLP) platform,
we found that the presence of recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein in the perfusion solution could
improve liver donor integrity. We thus envision that rhMG53 can function as a novel biological reagent to
improve donor organ preservation and function during liver transplantation. Studies designed in this project
focus on defining the physiological role of muscle-derived MG53 in hepatoprotection and elucidating the
underlying mechanisms of MG53-mediated control of MLKL signaling in injured hepatocytes (Aim 1); and
establishing the safety and efficacy of using rhMG53 to preserve the integrity of DCD liver donors during
NEVLP and to improve liver transplant outcomes in animal models (Aim 2)."

Genital herpes simplex type virus-2 (HSV-2) infection affects over 60 million people in the U.S. and over 536
million worldwide. An FDA-approved genital herpes vaccine is currently unavailable. After primary infection of
the vaginal mucocutaneous tissue (VMC), the virus spreads and establishes latency in sensory neurons of
regional dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The virus reactivates sporadically from latency and sheds back in the genital
tract, where it can cause severe recurrent lesions. Our long-term goal is to develop a therapeutic vaccine to
prevent recurrent genital herpes. Over the last 5 years, we have made significant progress in identifying
candidate HSV-2 antigens and characterizing the phenotype and function of antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that
associate with protection in seropositive women and in the guinea pig recurrent genital herpes model: (A) We
found that two HSV-2 tegument virion proteins (VP16 and VP22) and two ribonucleotide reductase subunit
proteins, (RR1 and RR2) are mainly targeted by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from “naturally” protected asymptomatic
women (those who, despite being infected, never develop recurrent genital herpes); (B) Similarly, VP16, VP22,
RR1, and RR2 proteins were the main HSV-2 antigens recognized by tissue-resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
that reside in DRG and VMC of protected asymptomatic guinea pigs; (C) Phenotypic and transcriptomic RNA-
Seq profiling of DRG- and healed VMC-resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in protected guinea pigs show that they
bear all the hallmarks of functional tissue-resident CXCR3+CD4+ and CXCR3+CD8+ T cells; (D) While therapeutic
vaccination with RR2 antigen produced strong protection in HSV-2 infected guinea pigs, the VP16, VP22 and
RR1 antigens provided modest protection; and (E) Treatment of HSV-2 infected guinea pigs with a neurotropic
adeno-associated virus vector (AAV8) expressing the guinea pig CXCL11 chemokine (a CXCR3 ligand) boosted
the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specifically in infected DRG and VMC and improved protection. Based on
these published and preliminary results, we hypothesize that boosting strong and long-lasting antiviral tissue-
resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses locally in DRG and VMC would produce a more robust/sustained
protection against HSV-2 reactivation and shedding and reduce recurrent genital herpes. To test this hypothesis,
we propose two Specific Aims: Aim 1. To evaluate the safety and protective efficacy, in the guinea pig genital
herpes model, of an innovative prime/pull therapeutic vaccine approach that consists of: (1) Priming T cells with
VP16, VP22, RR1, and RR2 antigens; and (2) “Pulling” primed T cells into infected DRG and VMC tissues by a
local delivery of T-cell attracting chemokines, CXCL9, CXCL10 and/or CXCL11, using a neurotropic AAV8
vector. Aim 2. To determine whether increasing the number and function of antiviral tissue-resident CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells within: (1) DRG (central neuronal immunity); and (2) VMC (peripheral epithelial immunity) correlates
with protection against genital herpes. The goal of this pre-clinical study is to bring a prime/pull vaccine to clinic."

The Reproductive Scientist Development Program (RSDP) is a highly diverse, multi-disciplinary, multi-
institutional research career development program for obstetrician-gynecologists in cell and molecular biology
and related fundamental sciences. The objective of this program is to educate obstetrician-gynecologists in
contemporary basic science research related to reproductive medicine and biology in order to prepare them for
research careers in academic medicine. The overall goal is to help ensure that academic obstetrics and
gynecology fulfills its mission to increase research and discovery in the reproductive sciences. Outstanding
MD/PhD, PhD, and MD scientists with broad research experience serve as faculty mentors.
A unique feature of this program is that outstanding individuals, upon completing a residency in obstetrics
and gynecology, and in many cases two or three years of clinical subspecialty fellowship, spend two years
(Phase I) in fundamental science research laboratories under the supervision and mentorship of experienced,
highly regarded accomplished scientists. During Phase I, Scholars are dedicated to a minimum of 75%
protected research effort. Following this experience, Scholars spend an additional two-year period
establishing their research program in a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Phase II) and transitioning
to independence. Here, the Scholar serves as a junior faculty member with at least 75% time devoted to
developing an independent research career. For the past five (5) years, salary support for scholars has been
provided by NICHD, while support for research related expenses has been provided from the various non-
federal agencies who contribute to the RSDP program.
NICHD funding under this mechanism will continue to support up to 2 Scholars for the duration of Phase I
and Phase II. This program will continue to educate young physician scientists in Obstetrics and Gynecology
and replenish the pipeline of reproductive scientists. The RSDP has a rich history of accomplishing this goal
already and is committed to continuing its objective of producing physician scientists who are highly
competitive for federal and non-federal research funding and who will become the next leaders of our
academic obstetrics and gynecology departments."

Veteran suicide – both for justice-involved Veterans and the broader Veteran population –
therefore likely requires interventions to address the legal and co-occurring difficulties of at-risk
Veterans.
 Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Justice-Involved Veterans (DBT-J) is distinctively
designed to address these range of needs faced by justice-involved Veterans, including
heightened suicide risk, antisocial behaviors, mental health and substance use concerns,
community-based structural barriers, and case management difficulties. Combining elements of
three prominent, evidence-based models, DBT-J provides 16 weeks of group psychotherapy,
case management services, and measurement-based care to Veterans with ongoing or recent
criminal justice involvement. Data from two prior clinical trials completed by the proposed study’s
Principal Investigator attest to the feasibility and acceptability of DBT-J within VHA behavioral
health settings. Although preliminary, data also suggest participation in DBT-J may yield
meaningful reductions in risk for future criminal behavior and resolution of high-priority case
management needs. Continued research, however, is needed to further investigate the program’s
efficacy.
 Toward these aims, the proposed Phase III clinical trial will:
1) Primary Aims 1-2: Assess the superiority of DBT-J over supportive group therapy in
 decreasing risk of future criminal behavior and increasing psychosocial functioning.
2) Secondary Aim: Assess the superiority of DBT-J over supportive group therapy in improving
 secondary treatment targets (i.e., suicidal ideation, criminogenic thinking, psychological
 distress, substance use, case management needs, quality of life, resilience, suicide-related
 behavior, and criminal recidivism).
3) Exploratory Aims 1-2: Assess for differential efficacy of DBT-J across high-priority JIV
 subgroups (i.e., violent versus nonviolent most recent offense type, presence/absence of a
 substance use disorder, and presence/absence of a severe mental illness); assess long-term
 impact of DBT-J participation (versus participation in supportive group therapy) on primary
 and secondary treatment targets."
10873728,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 3.5 million youth between the ages of 18 and 25 experience homelessness in the U.S. each year.
Relative to their stably housed peers, youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are vulnerable to a multitude of
risks affecting their health and well-being, including substance abuse, mental health challenges, victimization,
and death. YEH are also more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and are up to 10 times more likely to
contract HIV compared to their housed peers. Key to understanding the HIV risk and prevention behaviors of
YEH are their social networks—their web of personal social interactions and relationships. Increased HIV risk
among YEH has been tied to involvement in social networks with risk-taking peers and predominantly the
consequence of unsafe sex over injection drug use and needle sharing. Conversely, connections to family and
pro-social peers have been demonstrated to influence HIV prevention behaviors among YEH, including
condom use and HIV testing. However, the effect of different living situations among YEH—and particularly of
precarious housing (i.e., “couch-surfing” or temporarily staying with others)—on HIV risk and prevention
behaviors remains largely unknown. A sizable portion of the YEH population reports living in precarious
housing, and current evidence also suggests that that youth of color and youth identifying as LGBTQ+ are
more likely to be precariously housed compared to other YEH, populations that also carry disproportionate risk
for HIV. The proposed mixed-methods study has three aims. Aims 1 and 2 will use an existing dataset from
Have You Heard?, a longitudinal study of a peer leader training intervention for HIV prevention among YEH in
Los Angeles, California. Aim 1 will entail conducting an egocentric social network analysis to investigate
whether precarious housing and social support are associated with HIV risk (e.g., transactional sex,
condomless sex, sex under the influence, concurrent sex partners) and prevention (e.g., recent HIV testing and
PrEP awareness and use) behaviors among YEH. Aim 2 will use latent class analysis to explore the
heterogeneity of YEH based on living situation and social support networks in order to examine (a) whether
LGBTQ+ identity, racial/ethnic minority status, and duration of homelessness relate to emergent subgroups
and (b) whether HIV risk and prevention behaviors vary across these emergent subgroups. Aim 3 will entail
conducting qualitative interviews with precariously housed youth (n = 20) to explore how social support
networks and housing status influence HIV risk and prevention behaviors among precariously housed YEH.
This study will expand knowledge regarding HIV risk and prevention behaviors among YEH, paving the way for
the development of more tailored HIV prevention interventions for this vulnerable population. In addition, the PI
will receive training in understanding HIV risk and prevention among vulnerable youth populations, advanced
statistical methods, and mixed-methods research; gain experience conducting HIV-related research with YEH;
and opportunities for professional development."

This Phase II application will advance MT-401, a novel multi-tumor associated antigen (mTAA)-specific T cell
product for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers.
In the USA, ~3,500 AML patients receive hematopoietic stem cell therapy (HSCT) every year, but overall survival
remains <30%, with an estimated median survival of <1 year. Although AML is sensitive to immune-/T cell-based
interventions, these are limited due to: 1) lack of one antigen with sufficient tumor specificity, 2) tumor immune
escape, and 3) requirement for lymphodepletion which helps prevent engagement of the endogenous immune
system (epitope spreading) and leads to adverse events.
mTAA-specific T cells target multiple tumor associated antigens simultaneously, thereby minimizing tumor
escape. MT-401 targets 4 antigens highly expressed in AML, but with absent or low expression levels in healthy
tissue. Manufactured from allogeneic apheresis material from the HSCT donor, MT-401 recognizes target cells
via native T cell receptors (TCRs), by interacting with both class I and II MHC, leading to killing of cells expressing
any of these antigens, as well activation of other immune cells. mTAA-specific T cell products attacking the same
targets as MT-401 exhibited specific killing of HLA-matched cells expressing these antigens and reduction of
tumor growth in animal models. mTAA-specific therapy was also shown to be clinically safe in >170 patients with
various kinds of cancer. In a heavily pretreated AML population with active disease post-HSCT, this therapy
demonstrated complete (CR) or partial (PR) responses in some of the patients, while adjuvant patients remained
in remission longer than expected. Importantly, epitope spreading was observed leading to more durable
responses versus other cellular therapies. In order to enhance the efficacy of MT-401, we treated AML cells with
hypomethylating agents (HMA), which upregulate some of the tumor antigens targeted by MT-401, followed by
MT-401. Our in vitro data shows enhanced killing when treating with HMA followed by MT-401, supporting this
regimen in relapsed AML patients post-HSCT.
In this study, we are proposing a Phase II clinical trial of MT-401 following HMA as bridging therapy in relapsed
AML patients post-HSCT to prepare for future commercialization. Specific Aim 1 includes evaluation of efficacy
and safety of MT-401. Specific Aim 2 includes immune monitoring of patient samples including T cell expansion,
persistence, clonality, anti-tumor immune effects, tumor antigen expression, and epitope spreading. Successful
completion of this grant will lead to future BLA filing and commercial approval of MT-401 as a revolutionary T
cell therapy for AML patients."
10913599,"ABSTRACT
 Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss, which is characterized by progressive degeneration
of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their optic nerve axons. While age is a key risk factor, elevated intraocular
pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor, with topical IOP-lowering drugs as the first line treatment.
However, RGC degeneration and vision loss continues in half the patients taking these medications. By the time
when characteristic visual field defects are detected, 30-50% of the RGCs have already been lost. Thus, there
is an urgent need to develop novel therapies, independent of IOP reduction, which protect RGCs from
degeneration and boost the function of RGCs challenged in the disease.
 The binding of nerve growth factor (NGF) to TrkA attenuates reactive astrocytosis and promotes RGC
survival and proliferation. In contrast, the binding to p75NTR leads to astrocytosis and RGC apoptosis. Serum
levels of NGF are reduced in early and moderate glaucoma patients compared to healthy controls. Wildtype
human NGF (OxervateTM, Cenegermim, Dompe) was approved by FDA in 2018 as eye drops to treat
neurotrophic keratitis. In a recent Phase 1b clinical trial, it has been shown that topical use of Cenegermim was
safe and tolerable in open-angle glaucoma patients. However, wildtype NGF treatment failed to provide
neuroprotection in preclinical models of established glaucoma, antagonized by up-regulated p75NTR activity.
Moreover, inefficient manufacturing of Cenegermim using an E coli expression system compromises protein
stability and quality at a prohibitive cost for chronic treatment.
 In the Phase 1 study, we successfully reached all the milestones by designing and validating a human NGF
mutein, HC201. The mutein preserves protein stability and expression with enhanced TrkA receptor activities
but abrogated p75NTR binding and signaling. In rat models of glaucoma induced by episcleral vein cauterization,
topical treatment with HC201 robustly protected RGCs. In contrast, wildtype NGF was not effective. HC201
efficacy was also observed in diabetic corneal ulcer and dry eye disease models. Meanwhile, we have developed
a highly cost-effective and scalable process to produce HC201 in mammalian cells. In the Phase II SBIR
application, we will continue to validate the efficacy and elucidate mechanism of action in the inducible microbead
occlusion model of glaucoma in rats and squirrel monkeys. The use of different approaches to elevate IOP in
two species will significantly improve the success for translation to human clinical trials. With a highly experienced
drug development team, we also will initiate critical activities necessary to enable IND filing.
 Specific Aims include: 1) Determine whether topical treatment with HC201 preserves retinal integrity and
function compared to the placebo control using the microbead occlusion model of glaucoma in rats and squirrel
monkeys; 2) Manufacture cGMP grade HC201 from 100L engineering run; 3) Evaluate nonclinical safety of
repeat dose HC201.
 The long-term goal is to develop HC201, alone or in combination with current hypotensive medication, to
preserve and even restore vision in glaucoma patients."
10758191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) efficiently suppress HIV and serve as backbone
of antiretroviral therapies. However, new therapeutics are needed for continued control of HIV infection. 4’-
Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2’-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) is an NRTI with exceptional potency, stability, and unique
mechanism of action against HIV, which has been licensed by Merck. EFdA (also known as MK-8591 or Islatavir)
has been successfully used in Phase I and recently introduced in Phase II clinical trials. EFdA has generated
“compelling early results for both treatment and prevention” in patients, tested at remarkably low doses (up to
>10,000-fold lower doses than current NRTI drugs) aiming at once-weekly oral and once-yearly slow-release
dosing, unprecedented modalities for HIV therapies. Hence, this work is directly relevant to NIH guidelines for
high priority AIDS funding (NOT-OD-15-137) for “next generation therapies…that are longer acting.”
We have shown that a) EFdA has high potency in vitro, in cell culture (EC50=50 pM in PBMCs), mice and non-
human primate animal models. Although EFdA retains the 3’-OH, it blocks HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) in
vitro, primarily as an immediate/obligate and at times delayed chain terminator due to difficulty of EFdA-
terminated viral DNA to translocate. Thus, EFdA is termed a nucleotide reverse transcriptase translocation
inhibitor (NRTTI). However, the inhibition mechanism of EFdA in HIV-infected cells (primary or cell lines) remains
unknown. Toward that end, Co-I Malim has established an innovative assay that enables study of the EFdA
antiviral mechanism in HIV-infected cells. Additionally, in vitro passage experiments have identified mutations
that impart EFdA resistance through two paradigm-shifting dual mechanisms or resistance: decreased
incorporation/enhanced excision and decreased incorporation/enhanced translocation. Data on an EFdA analog
suggest efficient inhibition of EFdA-resistant HIV, although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not
understood. Notably, treatment with key new generation NNRTI doravirine (DOR) leads to resistance mutations
that impart hypersusceptibility to EFdA, paving the way for EFdA/DOR combination therapies. We hypothesize
that the structural attributes of EFdA and its analogs impact interactions with diverse RTs (wild-type, drug-
resistant, from diverse clades, viruses), leading to clinically important differences in efficiency of inhibition,
resistance, hypersusceptibility, and biochemical mechanism of action. This hypothesis will be tested through
three specific aims, which endeavor to answer the above questions using a combination of novel sequencing,
biochemical, structural, and virological approaches. This work will help optimize combination therapies that
reduce drug burden and have exceptional long-acting potential, addressing adherence challenges of chronic HIV
treatment."
10900611,"Project Abstract
The difficulty in eliminating HIV-1-infected cells is a major roadblock in eradication strategies. This is due to
several factors which includes the occlusion of vulnerable HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) epitopes that can
be recognized by antibodies (Abs) capable of potent Fc-effector functions such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular
Cytotoxicity (ADCC). With this application we propose to engineer Abs specific for highly conserved CD4 induced
(CD4i) Env epitopes to overcome these obstacles and facilitate the elimination of HIV-1 infected cells via ADCC.
Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that CD4i therapeutic Abs (tAbs) will be capable of more effective
elimination of infected primary CD4+ cells in the presence of HIV+ plasma than the best in class broadly
neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) and can thus be developed into a new family of tAb that will be effective in decreasing
and ultimately eliminating the viral reservoir in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). The proposed research builds
upon our successful development of new Ab-CD4 hybrids from weakly neutralizing or CD4i Abs specific for the
coreceptor binding site (CoRBS) or highly conserved, non-neutralizing gp120 inner domain Cluster A region. Our
lead CoRBS and Cluster A Ab-CD4 hybrids efficiently eliminate cells infected with primary HIV-1 isolates both in
vitro and ex vivo, demonstrating that they can circumvent the occlusion of epitopes on infected cells and virions.
Furthermore, they are also able to harness the ADCC activity of Abs present in HIV+ plasma, further enhancing
ADCC. Finally, an anti-Cluster A Ab-CD4 hybrid (e.g., A32-CD4) also inhibited viral rebound in hu-mice and led
to a significant reduction in integrated HIV DNA in an Fc-dependent manner. In the proposed project, we will
engineer Ab-CD4s of other CD4i specificities and also replace the CD4 moiety with potent small molecule CD4
mimetic compounds (CD4mc). These next generation Ab-CD4mc conjugates will efficiently sensitize HIV-1
infected cells to ADCC-mediated killing, providing a new tool to decrease the HIV-1-infected cell reservoir in
PLWH. Aim 1 is designed to prepare Ab-CD4 hybrids of other CD4i specificities including the Cluster A, C11-
like and the gp41 Principal Immunodominant regions. Aim 2 will develop Ab-CD4mc conjugates in which the
CD4 moiety of the Ab-CD4 will be replaced by a new generation of small compound CD4mcs including BNM-III-
170 and/or more active CD4mcs. The CD4mc will be attached to the Ab through a PEG linker using a novel
tRNA suppressor system. Ab-CD4/CD4mcs will be evaluated in vitro and ex-vivo for their ability to neutralize
primary viruses and eliminate HIV-1-infected cells alone or synergistically with HIV+ plasma, both in vitro and
ex-vivo. Aim 3 will test the capacity of the best engineered variants to reduce the size of viral reservoir in
humanized mice engrafted with PBMC from PLWH. This final aim will evaluate the capacity of the most promising
engineered variants to eliminate infected cells in vivo and delay viral rebound. Overall, the project will generate
a new family of potent tAbs able to eliminate HIV-1 infected cells to add new weapons to the growing arsenal
aimed at achieving a functional cure of HIV-1."

program (KL2 program) will strive to engage talented and motivated scholars to join the clinical and translational
science workforce with the goal of developing new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions for
diseases, with an emphasis on addressing health disparities. The KL2 program has stimulated clinical and
translational research across the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) by attracting, mentoring, training and
engaging scholars with diverse cultural, ethnic, racial and professional backgrounds and across scientific
disciplines (i.e. RN-PhDs, PharmDs, PhDs, MDs, and/or DDS-PhDs). These scholars receive an
interprofessional and interdisciplinary education where they learn with, about, and from each other, enabling
effective collaboration and discoveries in clinical and translational research. In the proposed funding period, the
KL2 program will train at least four junior faculty physician scientist scholars by supporting them for two years
on their path to independence, with the option of receiving an additional third year of institutional funding upon
completion of the program curriculum and objective evaluation of scholarly accomplishments. The program is
complemented by and integrated with the institutionally-funded BTC scholars program, allowing us to train five
(three in years 1-3; two in years 3-5) additional scholars under the same terms during the next funding period.
Integration of all scholars’ activities under our well-established mentoring and training program brings together
a critical mass of diverse professional experiences and talent benefiting all involved. The KL2 program has three
specific aims towards these goals are: 1) attract skilled and motivated early career clinical and translational
investigators from a broad range of health science disciplines, including individuals underrepresented in health
science; 2) provide comprehensive tailored support to mentor and train the scholars to promote pathways to
independence; and 3) engage scholars, facilitate interactions and enhance communications with the community
to raise awareness and accelerate solutions for health disparities. Innovations in our KL2 program include the
awarding of digital badges followed by micro-credentials, which are competency-based documentation of training
in specific areas; inclusion of community agency advisors and partners on scholars’ mentoring teams, aligning
with our goal to address health disparities in our community; and extensive partnering with other CTSA hubs.
The program will mentor, train and develop KL2 scholars’ professional skills and facilitate a seamless transition
to their next career level in the clinical and translational workforce. The overall goal of this KL2 program is to
develop the next generation of 21st century leaders whose backgrounds mirror the diversity of our community to

Memory is core to human cognition, undergoes protracted developmental maturation and age-related decline,
and is disrupted in numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the central role of memory in
health and disease, remarkably little is known about the neural mechanisms supporting memory in humans. In
this K99/R00 project, I propose to combine rare intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients and advanced
electrophysiological data analysis to track memory formation and maintenance in real time, and predict behavior
in children, adolescents, and adults. With these spatiotemporally precise measures of memory formation and
maintenance, this research will address critical gaps in knowledge about this core neurocognitive function.
Comparative analysis between intracranial recordings and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) measures will
further identify non-invasive EEG metrics applicable to developmental, lifespan, and disease-related research.
Causal links between the medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and memory are well-established. However,
there is a paucity of data on the mechanisms by which medial temporal and prefrontal regions interact to support
memory in humans. The proposed research will determine the dynamic, multi-level neural circuit mechanisms
that predict memory formation in humans across the lifespan. This research program will follow two
complementary, largely unexplored directions. Aim 1 (K99 phase) will map predictors of memory formation and
maintenance from the level of single neurons to that of large-scale neural circuits using simultaneous recordings
obtained from medial temporal and prefrontal regions in adults. Aim 2 (R00 phase) will define
electrophysiological predictors of memory success across the lifespan using intracranial recordings obtained
from medial temporal and prefrontal regions in children, adolescents, and adults. The overarching hypothesis is
that sub-second interactions in medial temporal, prefrontal, and medial temporal-prefrontal circuits will predict
individual memory formation. Completion of these Aims will generate novel mechanistic explanations of human
memory formation from childhood into adulthood. This research is directly relevant to Priorities #6 and #7 of the
BRAIN 2025 Report and will prepare the Principal Investigator for a successful independent research career.
To achieve these Aims, the proposed career development plan will build upon the Principal Investigator’s
previous training with four goals to enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: (1)
analysis of single-unit neuronal data; (2) application of multivariate statistics to time-series data; (2) ethical
aspects of conducting scientific research in clinical patients; and (4) research, mentoring, and administrative
skills requisite to run a successful laboratory. Training will be accomplished through a balance of direct
mentorship from animal and human neurophysiologists and coursework in neurophysiology, statistics,
responsible conduct of research, and preparing for a future faculty position."

Transgender and non-binary (TGNB) persons experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at alarming rates twice that
of their cisgender peers. Prior work has linked IPV to sexual risk behavior and increased risk for HIV seroconversion
among TGNB, but less is known about the impact of IPV on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake, and persistence among TGNB. While past findings suggest the potential for IPV
to have a strong deleterious effect on HIV prevention continuum engagement, IPV experiences and impacts on
HIV/STI risk and prevention behaviors have yet to studied among a diverse group of TGNB persons. Additional
research is currently needed to model pathways between IPV and HIV risk for subgroups of trans feminine (TF), trans
masculine (TM), and gender non-binary (GNB) persons. Guided by a framework that combines Syndemic and
Minority Stress Theory, the proposed innovative observational cohort study will examine how specific forms of IPV
(e.g., physical, sexual, emotional, controlling gender expression and/or transition) in the context of steady or casual
intimate relationships contribute to HIV/STI risk and protective behaviors among subgroups of TGNB persons over
a 24-month timeframe. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Using qualitative methodologies, explore the perceived associations
between IPV, relationship characteristics and dynamics, and HIV risk and prevention behaviors among gender
diverse TGNB persons. 2. Examine gender-based differences in the longitudinal associations of IPV with HIV testing,
PrEP uptake, PrEP persistence, STI diagnosis (primary outcomes), condomless sex, and HIV seroconversion
(secondary outcomes) among a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of TGNB persons (TF, TM, and GNB groups). 3.
Determine the individual-, interpersonal-, network-, community-, and structural-level risk and resilience factors that
mediate (or moderate) the associations between IPV and HIV risk and protective behaviors for each group. 4. Make
recommendations for interventions that interrupt the pathways between IPV and HIV/STI risk based on quantitative
data from the cohort and qualitative data, guided by technical experts. We will assess sexual risk behavior, conduct
HIV and STI testing, and assess PrEP uptake and persistence over the 24 months of follow-up. We hypothesize that
there will be differences in the frequency, severity, and overall impact of IPV on HIV/STI risk among subgroups of
TGNB persons. We also suspect greater frequency of IPV will be associated with history of childhood abuse, mental
health problems, substance use, sexual risk taking and lower levels of HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and PrEP persistence.
We anticipate that alcohol and substance use among participants and their partners will be highly associated with
episodes of IPV and with HIV risk behavior. We also hypothesize that experiences of gender affirmation, coping skills
and social support will mediate the effects of IPV on risk behavior, HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and PrEP persistence.
The proposed study will advance our understanding of both the risk and resiliency factors relevant to preventing and
reducing IPV, reducing IPV-associated risk behaviors, and increasing HIV protective behaviors among diverse TGNB
persons. This research will inform the development and adaptation of IPV, HIV, and substance abuse interventions
for TGNB persons."
10923934,"Project Summary
Poverty increases HIV risk for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Africa. AGYW experiencing
poverty are more likely to engage in age disparate, transactional, and condomless sex, which increases their
risk of HIV acquisition. The HIV incidence of AGYW is a public health concern in Kenya where AGYW (ages
15-24) account for 28% of new HIV diagnoses and nearly half of AGYW across the nation are living in poverty.
To address the linkages between poverty and HIV risk, economic empowerment may be an essential strategy
to reducing HIV incidence in this population. However, there remains gaps in how economic empowerment is
measured and addressed in HIV prevention interventions for AGYW. Without valid and reliable tools to
measure economic empowerment, there will remain a gap in how to design and assess the impact of economic
empowerment HIV prevention interventions for AGYW in high burden settings. The goal of this Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application for Principal Investigator Dr. Margaret W. Gichane,
PhD, MSPH is to improve measurement of economic empowerment to inform the adaptation of a combination
cash transfer intervention for AGYW in Kenya. To achieve career and research goals, Dr. Gichane has
assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team with expertise in qualitative research, scale development,
intervention adaptation, and economic empowerment. Her training aims are to: 1) Acquire foundational
knowledge and skills in grounded theory to expand conceptualizations of economic empowerment; 2) Develop
methodological expertise in scale development and validation; and 3) Cultivate expertise in participatory
intervention development. Specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) characterize economic empowerment among
AGYW; 2) develop and validate an economic empowerment scale for AGYW; and 3) adapt and pilot test a
cash transfer intervention and measure the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on economic
empowerment and HIV risk behaviors. The proposed mentoring, training, and research plan in this K01

The objective of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Award Application is to provide Dr. Alena Markmann
with a strong foundation in human immunology and the latest methods for studying human immune cells before
launching her independent research career on the human immune response to RNA viruses. Dr. Markmann is
an Assistant Professor of Medicine, tenure track, at the University of North Carolina -Chapel Hill (UNC) School
of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. The candidate has
expertise in and a strong track record of publications on antibody structure, antibody-antigen interactions and
antibody neutralization of viruses. By strengthening her knowledge of adaptive immunity to RNA viruses and
mastering the latest methods for analyzing antigen specific B cells, Dr. Markmann will study how the human
immune response to emerging flaviviruses like dengue and Zika can suppress viral infection and disease or
enhance viral replication and exacerbate disease. The candidate and her mentor Dr. Aravinda de Silva have
designed a training plan that includes a rigorous research component along with didactic instruction, networking
and presentation opportunities, team management skills as well as manuscript writing and grantsmanship.
Together these skills will establish the methods and principles necessary for successful career development.
Flaviviruses are enveloped positive stranded RNA viruses that pose a growing threat to the human population
and cause millions of infections annually. They are vector-borne, transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes, and cause
a spectrum of disease manifestations including febrile illness, encephalitides that can cause lifelong
complications, Congenital Zika Syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes. For the most
part, flaviviral infection result in a neutralizing protective antibody response against the infecting virus, that can
last for years after infection. The four dengue viruses however are very similar antigenically and in many cases,
result in generating a broad cross-neutralizing antibody responseto dengue virus serotypes that individuals have
not yet been exposed to. Thus far, no one has identified the viral target site of these broadly neutralizing dengue
antibodies that exist in the serum. Furthermore, though we know of a few major targets of the Zika protective
antibody response from studying memory B cells, we do not know what the serum targets are. Preliminary results
suggest that in the case of Zika serum antibody responses, binding targets are correlated with known strongly
neutralizing memory B cell-derived antibody targets. Thus, we hypothesize in Aim 1, that serum antibody
responses will mirror memory B cell responses, but will likely come from a smaller number of B cell clones and
be less cross-reactive with other flaviviruses. In Aim 2 we will identify the viral binding targets of broadly cross-
neutralizing dengue antibodies from the serum. These studies will result in the ident ification of critical protective
viral targets to both dengue and Zika viruses from the serum antibody compartment in order to inform successful
vaccine design."
10763376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The genomes of microbes and their hosts are intertwined through time. Pathogenic microbes
evolve mechanisms to manipulate host cell functions and hosts evolve mechanisms defending
from infections. Buried in this evolutionary history of host-microbial conflict are genetically
encoded innovations conferring pivotal advantages. Sometimes the discovery of these functions
presents an opportunity to harness the process as a research tool. Antibodies, restriction
endonucleases, and CRISPR/Cas systems are examples of natural immune processes
repurposed to revolutionize modern biology. A central premise of this proposal is to take a
similar view of host-microbe conflict as a crucible for biological innovation. Our approach guides
rigorous multidisciplinary studies using complementary computational and experimental analysis
to investigate diverse host and microbe processes. Our work is revealing a new class of broadly
acting antiviral functions. By considering the evolutionary implications of enveloped viruses
exploiting the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, we
discovered a new host immune function, encoded by retroCHMP3, that can block the release of
maturing virus particles from infected cells. In addition to characterizing the evolutionary process
leading to this specific biological innovation, we will develop new computational pipelines to
discover related antimicrobial functions in genomes of diverse mammals. The work is also
revealing a primary role for retrotransposons and other selfish genetic elements in creating and
regulating genes involved in host-virus conflicts. New discoveries related to the activity of selfish
genes also applies to our work on DNA virus evolution. Using vaccinia virus as a model system
for large DNA virus evolution, we are pursuing several experimental schemes revealing
mechanisms of virus adaptation. One example tackles the question of how viruses acquire host
genes through horizontal transfer, a mechanism of adaptation common in diverse virus classes.
Discovering a primary role for retrotransposons in mobilizing host transcripts to virus genomes
connects classic work on phage transduction in bacteria with eukaryotic systems and opens a
range of new questions related to virus control of genetic exchange among diverse species.
Finally, we will extend our studies to host systems outside dedicated immune defenses,
including a project studying intriguing signals of rapid evolution in proteins regulating water
balance in the intestine. These genetic conflicts involve enteric pathogens causing diarrhea and
guide new studies aimed at repurposing host peptide variants as novel antibiotic strategies."

The trabecular meshwork (TM) is a pressure sensitive tissue located in the anterior segment of the eye, key
regulator of intraocular pressure. Malfunction of this tissue results in improper drainage of aqueous humor (AH)
outflow, leading to ocular hypertension, the major risk factor for developing glaucoma. The TM consists of an
irregular lattice of collagen beams lined by TM endothelial-like cells, followed a zone of loose connective tissue-
containing TM cells, through which AH must pass before leaving the eye. Changes in pressure gradients and
fluid flow associated with eye movement, circadian rhythm or the ocular pulse cause small and high variations
in intraocular pressure (IOP), which are translated in continuous cycles of tissue deformation and relaxation.
Cells in the TM are known to be able of sensing these deformations as mechanical forces and respond to them
by eliciting a variety of different responses.
Our laboratory has identified activation of autophagy and the nuclear translocation of the autophagy marker LC3,
in TM cells following application of mechanical stretch. Activation of autophagy was also observed in TM cells
quickly after pressure elevation in porcine perfused eyes and in ocular hypertensive mouse models. This
prompted us to propose autophagy as a crucial physiological response triggered in TM cells in response to strain
to adapt to mechanical forces and maintain cellular homeostasis, which exerts a dual role in repair and
mechanotransduction. The nature of the mechanosensor, mechanosignaling, and exact roles of autophagy in
TM cell and tissue function are still not characterized.
The goal of this application is to investigate an interplay between autophagy, primary cilium and
mechanotransduction in TM cells and to determine the role of such interplay in outflow pathway physiology and
pathophysiology. More in particular, we will test the hypothesis that autophagy plays a critical role in TM
mechanotransduction by maintaining primary cilia prevalence and length, and that dysregulation of autophagy
with aging and in the glaucomatous outflow pathway compromises primary cilia-dependent IOP homeostatic
response. We anticipate that completion of this project will contribute to a further understanding of the role of
autophagy in outflow pathway tissue physiology and pathophysiology. Most relevant, our studies have the
potential of identifying a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma."

The All of Us New England Clinical Center (AoU-NE-CC) is a collaboration of New England–based research
teams with the necessary expertise and resources in nutrition and clinical translational science to implement
successfully all 3 modules of the NIH Common Fund’s Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) Clinical Center
program. The Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University (Tufts-
HNRCA) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will lead the AoU-NE-CC and partner with All of Us New
England to ensure the diversity of participants and scientific rigor required to identify inter-individual variability
of response to dietary patterns. The AoU-NE-CC is committed to All of Us core values and has implemented
best practices of team science throughout its development. The AoU-NE-CC will serve as a key partner in the
development of a rigorous NPH common protocol and examine habitual dietary intake (Module 1), measure
physiological responses to a mixed-meal challenge (Modules 1-3), and identify responses to 3 intervention
diets in both free-living (Module 2) and domiciled (Module 3) controlled feeding conditions. Coupled with
standard All of Us data, the physiological responses collected through these modules will be used to develop
predictive algorithms that inform precision nutrition approaches for long-term health. To attain maximum
metabolic and microbiome response variability, we propose the following 14-day isocaloric diets for Modules 2
and 3, separated by 4-week washout periods: (1) a high-adherence Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) diet; (2) a low-adherence DASH diet; and (3) a ketogenic diet. We also propose the use of the
thoroughly tested mixed-meal challenge PhenFlex, which can be standardized across clinical centers to
provide a multisystem assessment of metabolic flexibility. With its outstanding core facilities, including
metabolic kitchens and domiciled feeding and nursing centers, as well as a rich legacy of conducting rigorous
feeding studies, the AoU-NE-CC is uniquely skilled and positioned to serve as a clinical center for the NPH.
Additional strengths of the AoU-NE-CC include extensive experience in recruiting clinical populations and
biobanking, engaging volunteers through community outreach, active participation in global precision nutrition
initiatives, and an outstanding track record of productive multisite collaborations in nutrition, omics, and
precision health. Importantly, the Tufts-HNRCA and MGH teams are closely aligned with the All of Us New
England team and its record of high participant recruitment and retention and its diverse cohort, which will
support the NPH consortium goals. By partnering with NPH and All of Us in this novel modular discovery
science study, the AoU-NE-CC and its experienced, forward-thinking, highly collaborative team will contribute
to the development of precision nutrition approaches that support optimal health across the adult lifespan."

Callous-unemotional (CU) traits, defined by low empathy, guilt, and prosociality, predict very high risk for
childhood disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) and adverse adult outcomes, including violence, psychopathy,
and crime. Standard treatments for DBD are not as effective for children with CU traits. To inform personalized
treatments for DBD, a better understanding is needed of specific risk factors for CU traits beginning early in
childhood. The overall objectives of this proposal are to identify specific child-level and parenting-level risk factors
that predict CU traits across early childhood. The central hypothesis is that reduced sensitivity to cues of threat
and affiliation will specifically predict CU traits. High parental harshness, low warmth, and low emotion scaffolding
are also hypothesized to predict increases in CU traits, including via interactions with low threat sensitivity and
affiliation among both parents and children. The rationale for the proposal is that by successfully isolating specific
child- and parenting-level risk factors that predict CU traits, novel treatment strategies can be developed to
reduce CU traits, and in turn, disrupt pathways to DBDs, including via multi-level treatment modules that target
behavior, physiology, and attention. The hypotheses will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1)
Establish phenotypic markers of CU traits in early childhood; (2) Establish phenotypic markers of parenting
practices; and (3) Illuminate shared temperament and parenting factors that predict CU traits. All three aims will
be pursued within a prospective longitudinal study. Participants (N=500) will be recruited from community and
clinical settings at the University of Pennsylvania (n=250) and Boston University (n=250) and assessed at time
1 (aged 3–4) and time 2 (aged 5-6). Under the first aim, low threat sensitivity and affiliation will be tested as child-
level risk factors for CU traits across multiple levels of analysis, including parent-report and multiple new
computer and observational tasks that allow simultaneous measurement of attentional (i.e., eye-tracking) and
physiological (i.e., respiratory sinus arrythmia) processes. Under the second aim, low threat sensitivity and
affiliation of parents, assessed again across multiple levels of analysis, will be tested as predictors of different
parenting dimensions of harshness, low warmth, and low emotion scaffolding. Under the third aim, the interplay
of parenting behaviors and shared temperament features of parents and children will be tested as dyadic risk
factors for CU traits. The proposal is innovative because it will generate new measures of precision risk factors
that predict CU traits, is guided by extensive preliminary data, hypotheses are tested during a critical
developmental period for understanding CU traits, and the sophisticated quantitative analysis incorporates a rich
multi-method measurement framework that will generate new knowledge about the biological, cognitive, social,
and emotional processes underlying CU traits. The proposed research is significant because it will identify
biomarkers and behavioral indicators of illness (NIMH Priority 2.2) and lead to improved capacity to
operationalize specific risk factors to target in interventions to mitigate risky pathways to CU traits and DBD."

The United States population is becoming increasingly older and the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and its common precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is expected to dramatically rise in the coming years.
As such, there is an immediate national need to further understand the neurophysiological basis of these neuro-
degenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown disruption of gamma-band neural oscillatory activity in animal
models of AD. Further, visual stimulation at gamma frequencies has been shown to increase the clearance of
amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in mouse models, while improving cognitive performance. Despite
these groundbreaking findings, research into gamma oscillatory activity in humans with AD remains scarce.
Relatedly, visuospatial attention processes are among the earliest and most severely affected cognitive functions
in MCI and AD. Dysfunction in this domain has also been shown to be more specific for identifying Alzheimer’s
type dementia relative to other forms (e.g., frontotemporal dementia) when compared to dysfunction in other
cognitive domains (e.g., memory). Although neuropsychological testing has shown clear deficits in visuospatial
attention in patients with MCI and AD, very little is known about the neural oscillatory activity that underlies these
deficits. The current study aims to partially remedy these knowledge gaps by utilizing the spatial precision and
exquisite temporal resolution (i.e., millisecond) of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging. Briefly, persons with
AD, MCI, and demographically-matched controls will complete two cognitive tasks during MEG recording; one
examining multispectral visual entrainment activity and another investigating visuospatial attention processing.
The resulting MEG data will be transformed into the time-frequency domain and imaged using a beamforming
approach. The output dynamic functional maps of electrical neural activity will be used to examine baseline and
task-related entrainment and oscillatory activity among regions serving visual and visuospatial processing. In
particular, we will identify the statistically anomalous neural oscillations in patients with MCI and AD, and then
link these neural data to regional Aβ deposition and overall performance (e.g., general and domain-specific
cognition, functional capacity, etc.). Our Aims are: (1) To quantify the cortical dynamics during visual entrainment
at specific frequencies (i.e., 20, 35, 40, and 45 Hz) in patients with MCI or mild AD, and decifer the relationship
between local gamma activity and quantitative Aβ deposition, and (2) to identify deficits in the tracking of attended
visual stimuli in patients with MCI and mild AD, and determine how this relates to cognitive performance. To this
end, we will utilize the latest MEG and source reconstruction techniques, neural oscillatory analysis methods,
quantitative Aβ PET imaging, and neuropsychological assessments to delineate the neurophysiological bases
of cognitive impairments in patients with MCI and AD. This research will aid in illuminating the neural dynamics
underlying cognitive dysfunction in those with MCI and AD, with the primary goals of scientific discovery and
developing the research and clinical skills of the applicant to produce a successful physician-scientist."
10873248,"HIV-1 dissemination critically depends on migration of infected T cells. Unexpectedly, a fraction of the infected
T cells was recently found to exist as small syncytia, containing up to four nuclei. Importantly, these entities
differ from larger syncytia which sometimes can be observed in late stages of virus
dissemination/pathogenesis. Indeed, and as shown in three independent intravital imaging studies, they are
present already at the earliest stages of infection. Our analyses in physiologically relevant in vitro settings
further documented that small T cell syncytia can transfer virus to uninfected cells, suggesting that they can
contribute to early virus dissemination.
With this R01 application, we propose to start exploring whether HIV-1-induced small syncytia can indeed
directly contribute to virus spread. We will start our investigations by characterizing motility/migration properties
of syncytia and analyzing their role in virus transmission dynamics. Host and viral factors involved in
homeostatic maintenance of the syncytial compartment will also be studied. Importantly, we have recruited the
support of a leading HIV proteomics lab in order to comprehensively map the expression profiles of syncytia.
Should the data resulting from this work support the hypothesis that syncytia contribute significantly to virus
dissemination, we will pursue further funding in order to study potential strategies against these entities."

ABSTRACT
Black women face an unequal opportunity to survive breast cancer, when compared with white
women; they are 1.43 times more likely to die, even though their incidence rates are lower (127.8
vs 133.7, respectively). Vital for designing modifiable policy pathways to breast health equity, are
identifying the roles of 1) disadvantaged racially segregated neighborhoods (i.e., segregated
communities that are densely populated by blacks who live in poverty) and 2) factors driven by
community decisions and policies that created these disadvantaged racially
segregated neighborhoods. Our overall objective is to determine the most effective policy
pathways for disbanding the role of disadvantaged racially segregated neighborhoods in
facilitating disparities in two breast cancer outcomes –late-stage diagnosis and mortality.
Enriched by a mixed-method design, we leverage use of longitudinal population-based state
Cancer registry, CDC mortality, and Census zip code data, and also focus group/interview data
from breast cancer survivors, city planners, political analysts, and policymakers in Memphis,
TN, to delineate modifiable place-related system factors that can reduce racial disparities in
breast health. Successful completion of this research will provide the necessary foundation for
designing public policy interventions that focus on equity and social justice concerns to resolve
disparities in various disease states."
10745285,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the population, with rising incidence of
cardiovascular disease contributed to by epidemic increases in obesity and associated type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Although existing drugs are effective in acutely correcting decompensated heart failure, this continues
to be associated with unacceptable rates of rehospitalization and mortality. A drug combination adding
neprilysin inhibition to the previous standard-of-care for heart failure, angiotensin receptor blockade, was
recently approved by the FDA based on its ability to extend the life of patients with reduced cardiac output.
However, the broad action of the peptidase inhibitor in this combination could theoretically be improved,
thereby reducing possible side effects and increasing therapeutic effectiveness. The specific enzyme substrate
responsible for the beneficial effects of this drug is not yet clear. While it has been assumed to be natriuretic
peptides, other peptides are also cleaved by neprolysin, many of which have potential offsetting and/or side
effects. Another prominent potentially beneficial substrate of this protease is secretin, a peptide hormone with
useful effects on cardiac contractility and ejection fraction, coronary perfusion, peripheral vascular resistance,
post-cibal satiety, and glucose-sensitive incretin action. Prior to work supported by this grant in its previous
funding cycle, there were no small molecules known to mimic or enhance secretin activity at its receptor. In
that work, we screened nearly 400,000 compounds and identified several structural classes of compounds that
demonstrate robust and reproducible activation of secretin receptor signaling in vitro in model cell systems. As
a continuation of those encouraging data, we now propose to utilize medicinal chemical approaches to
optimize the scaffolds identified in the previous work. These include compounds with the ability to act as
positive allosteric modulators of secretin action, as well as those having intrinsic agonist activity. We will utilize
cycles of systematic chemical modification and rational enhancement with in vitro pharmacologic
characterization to improve their pharmacological and ADME/T properties (Aims 1 and 2). The best candidates
in each structural series will be studied using in vivo animal models to evaluate their oral bioavailability and
efficacy, as well as an in vivo rat model of ischemic heart failure (Aim 3). Our approach will validate this
receptor as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in heart failure and provide first-in-class small
molecule compounds that we hope to take into clinical trials in the future."
10745335,"SUMMARY
To date, the etiology of idiopathic male infertility is not fully understood, and hormonal male contraceptives have
not been effective. Through novel approaches to sequencing and sequencing analysis of male infertile patients
and controls, this proposal seeks to identify new coding and non-coding genes and genomic regions required for
male fertility and to validate the functional requirement of newly identified genes through mouse models. Past
limited sequencing-based approaches have so far only been able to provide diagnostic variants to 1.5% of
infertile men who present to the clinic, a yield that will improve with identification of more genes underlying
infertility in men. One limitation to past progress has been the inability of conventional short-read sequencing to
resolve haplotype-specific information: whether two or more mutations in each gene are on the same or separate
alleles. Since gene loss-of-function typically requires damage to both alleles, it is of paramount importance to be
able to resolve this information. Through long-read sequencing (a newly established and validated technology)
we will identify novel damaging mutations at haplotype-specific resolution, correlating multiple novel damaging
mutations with potential loss-of-function in our newly sequenced patients. Additionally, since sperm are haploid
and previous studies have demonstrated a requirement for newly synthesized genes after meiosis, we will
identify mutations lethal to sperm development through sequencing of both whole blood and sperm. Mutations
present in blood (representing both maternal and paternal genomes) that are absent in sperm [with haploid
genomes representing 8 million (2^23) chromosome combinations] demonstrate a requirement for those genes in
the later stages of sperm development. Thus, through our proposed work we will identify for the first-time genes
required for male fertility in men who may in fact be fertile. Lastly, we will apply CRISPR/Cas9 in mice to validate
the functional requirement of candidate genes that we identify through our sequencing studies. Novel male
infertility associated genes that are found to be expressed in sperm or epididymal cells, are evolutionarily
conserved in vertebrates, including mice and humans, and rank among the highest in our patients will be
prioritized for validation. We will assess the fertility phenotype of mutant mice and further explore molecular
pathophysiology, which for some genes may determine candidacy as a contraceptive target."

The proposed research explores mechanisms of dysregulated lipid metabolism in failing hearts within the
dynamic processes of long chain fatty acid (LCFA) delivery from the circulation to metabolism in the
cardiomyocyte (CM). We will explore the roles of LCFA delivery by endothelial cells (EC) to CMs and rates of
LCFA uptake by CMs in adverse metabolic remodeling in a mouse model of heart failure that recapitulates key
metabolic defects in failing human hearts. Hearts rely on LCFA oxidation, up to 70% of fuels, to meet ATP
demand. LCFA are also esterified into the neutral triglyceride (TG) pool and into physiologically active acyl-
derivatives. In failing hearts, LCFA oxidation is reduced and the lipid profile becomes toxic. We have shown a
reduction in the central LCFA metabolite, acyl-CoA, in failing hearts is detrimental, and increased acyl
CoA production by ACSL1 improves metabolic state and mitigates functional decline. 13C NMR of hearts
revealed an exponential component of 13C LCFA entry into TG that reflects LCFA uptake rate and is sensitive
to activity of the LCFA transporter, CD36. LCFA uptake is also accelerated by metabolic trapping via
esterification of LCFA to acyl-CoA by ACSL1, a process that is sex-dependent. Experiments on mice with cell-
specific, CD36 deletion in ECs (EC-CD36 KO) and CMs (CM-CD36 KO) will support the objective to study the
separate roles of LCFA delivery by ECs to CMs and uptake by CMs on LCFA metabolism within competing
pathways, including deleterious ceramide formation in failing hearts. Potential differences in LCFA uptake and
metabolism between two primary physiological sources, albumin-bound LCFA and lipoprotein-bound TG, will
be studied. The hypothesis is: a) the contributions of EC CD36-dependent and independent transendothelial
transport of LCFAs into CMs of normal and diseased hearts determine the metabolic fate of LCFAs, separate
from CM CD36 activity, and depend on the LCFA source; b) there are sex-dependent differences in both CD36
transport of LCFA and trapping of LCFAs into CMs via esterification that contribute to the lipotoxic profile of
failing hearts. Specific aims are: 1. Elucidate EC CD36 contributions to transendothelial transport of LCFA
uptake kinetics and metabolic fate in normal and failing hearts of male vs. female EC-CD36 KO mice. 2.
Distinguish CM-CD36 from EC contributions to LCFA uptake kinetics and metabolic fate in hearts of normal
and failing heats of male vs. female CM-CD36 KO mice. 3. Elucidate reciprocal effects of CD36 transport and
metabolic trapping by ACSL1 on LCFA use in normal and failing hearts, by silencing of CD36 in hearts having
low overexpression of ACSL1 (MHC-ACSL1 J3) and in hearts from crossed, MHC-ASCL1xEC-CD36 KO and
MHC-ASCL1xCM-CD36 KO mice. 4. Distinguish contributions of EC-CD36 and CM-CD36 to LCFA uptake
rates and metabolism from albumin-bound vs. chylomicron-bound sources in normal and failing hearts of wild
type, EC-CD36 KO, and CM-CD36 KO mice. Outcomes will provide unique information on molecular events
modulating lipid content as new targets to resolve metabolic imbalances in failing hearts."

This application for an NIAAA K01 Career Development Award proposes studies of the pharmacogenomics of
alcohol use disorder (AUD) and acamprosate treatment response. Our proposed use of AUD patient-derived
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)--an innovative and comprehensive “cell line based” model system will
make it possible to advancing our understanding of both drug action and of disease pathophysiology. These
results might provide novel mechanistic insight into molecular and genomic signatures for AUD as well as
mechanisms underlying individual variation in response to acamprosate. Therefore, the proposed studies
include the following aims, Aim 1: To generate a panel of iPSCs from patient-derived LCLs as a novel cell
model system for functional genomic studies of AUD and its drug therapy. Aim 2: To identify molecular
signatures for alcohol or acamprosate exposure using human neural cells to perform genome-wide
transcriptomic profiles using patient-derived iPSC-derived neuronal and glial cell types differentiated from
iPSCs obtained from AUD patients and healthy controls. Aim 3: To determine molecular signatures for alcohol
and acamprosate exposure, and mechanisms underlying individual variation in those signatures by mapping
targeted metabolomic profiles of patient-derived iPSC. The significance of the proposed studies results from
the societal importance of AUD and of patient derived iPSC-based research, from the possibility of more highly
individualized treatment for AUD, and from the fact that these studies may suggest novel genetic mechanisms
that might influence individual variation in acamprosate response in AUD patients. As a result, the proposed
studies would have both translational and basic implications for genetic mechanisms that might
influence alcohol and acamprosate effect genome-wide and for more highly individualized
acamprosate therapy of AUD.
In summary, Dr. Ho, the applicant, proposes to take advantage of the NIAAA K01 Award mechanism to
broaden her experience with the utilization of multi-omics data (under the direction of her Primary Mentor: Dr.
Richard Weinshilboum), translational pharmacogenomics with a focus on AUD (under the guidance of co-
mentor: Dr. Victor Karpyak), and iPSC technology (under the guidance of co-mentor: Dr. Zhexing Wen). The
resources and mentoring provided by an NIAAA K01 Award would help make it possible for Dr. Ho to achieve
her goal of becoming an independent investigator studying molecular and genomic mechanisms of response to
alcohol exposure using patient-derived iPSCs and pharmacogenomic studies of acamprosate response in
patients with AUD. Receipt of an NIAAA K01 Award would represent a critical step toward Dr. Ho’s ultimate
goal of becoming an independent investigator, for obtaining the additional training required to significantly
expand the nature of the biomedical research contributions that she might ultimately make and to generate
preliminary data in support of an NIH R01 research grant application."

Men are less likely to report TB-related symptoms, get diagnosed, smear convert, or complete treatment,
suggesting that outcomes along the TB cascade are worse for men. Despite men's greater burden of TB and
poorer treatment outcomes, no interventions have been developed to address these gendered disparities. Building
on our preliminary research that identified men's preferences for a TB care support intervention, we identified
Coach Mpilo (CM), a peer-support HIV treatment intervention that was developed by men for men in South Africa,
and tailored for men TB infection. The aims of our study are to assess the feasibility of CM for men and assess
secondary outcomes for treatment completion and HIV viral suppression to inform a Hybrid Type I intervention. In
Aim 1, CM will be further tailored to men initiating TB treatment (CM-TB) and for with HIV co-infection (CM-TB/HIV).
Using a mixed methods approach guided by ADAPT-IIT model, we will conduct interviews, CM simulations, and a
pre-test to assess men's usability of CM-TB and CM-TB/HIV in this setting. We will conduct Aims 2 and 3
concurrently. In Aim 2, CM-TB will be evaluated to assess feasibility among men and secondary outcomes for
retention in care and successful TB treatment (TBT) outcomes. Using a randomized controlled trial design, men
(N=120) initiating TBT will be randomized to receive CM or clinic-based standard of care adherence support. The
primary outcome is feasibility, acceptability, willingness and safety for men with secondary outcomes for completing
TBT within 180 days per arm. In Aim 3, the feasibility of CM-TB/HIV for men (n=120) co-infected with TB and HIV
will be assessed. The primary outcome is feasibility, acceptability, willingness and safety with secondary outcomes
measured for proportion of men adherent to anti-retroviral therapy at TBT completion and with a suppressed viral
(SVL) load 6 months post-ART initiation and post-TBT completion per study arm. If shown to be feasible, we will
propose an randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness in improving men's TB and HIV outcomes and
adapted to improve men's health in the context of non-communicable diseases in South Africa and globally."

The University of Arizona (UA) Superfund Research Program (SRP) has successfully translated research 
findings focused on the health and environmental impacts of mining on vulnerable communities and engaged 
affected citizens to reduce and mitigate exposure through learning modules, outreach activities, workshops, 
capacity building, and developing community engaged participatory research. The UA SRP Community 
Engagement Core (CEC) will continue to engage Native American communities and Tribal Colleges and 
Universities in the Southwest that are located adjacent to mining sites by building and expanding upon previously 
nurtured partnerships including The Tohono O’odham Nation, Tohono O’odham Community College, The Navajo 
Nation, Diné College, and Navajo Community Health Representatives. The goal of the current UA SRP CEC is 
to specifically focus on community engagement with Native Americans living near mining sites, as these 
communities are disproportionately impacted by mining and arsenic contaminated water, resulting in increased 
exposure to arsenic and higher rates of diabetes, particularly uncontrolled diabetes. Supported by the Data 
Management and Analysis Core and the Administration Core and working in close coordination with the 
Research Experience and Training Coordination Core, the CEC will ensure community-engaged participatory 
research, training, education and capacity building through the development of community-engaged tools 
centered around a solution-based approach to indigenous food sovereignty as a means to minimize and mitigate 
the increased risk of diabetes. Food sovereignty efforts are developing and exist in many tribal communities, 
however, the connection to arsenic in water as a result of mining and increased risks to diabetes is lacking. Using 
findings from the UA SRP research projects, the CEC will engage in multi-lateral communications with key 
stakeholders. Specifically, the CEC will be instrumental in innovatively engaging tribal communities in a manner 
that takes cultural values and traditions into consideration (in an indigenous-centric manner) and will provide 
training, education and capacity building to maintain food sovereignty and decrease the risks of arsenic 
exposure. By empowering tribal communities to take local action to mitigate and minimize these impacts in a 
more sustained manner, the approach of the UA SRP CEC will be truly bilateral. Finally, the UA SRP CEC will 
engage tribal partners in the research process to increase understanding of environmental and health risks of 
mining and arsenic contaminated waters that lead to increased risks to diabetes. Most critically, the CEC will 
engage in mitigation approaches to reduce and minimize risks to vulnerable Native American populations. 
Engagement with tribal communities will increase awareness of risks and best practices in ways that honor tribal 
sovereignty and knowledge and aid in cultural understanding while reducing racial misconceptions and fostering 
university-community partnerships based on trust and transparency."

Andreotta, Zhang)
The overarching goal of the University of Arizona Superfund Research Program (UA SRP) is to improve human
health and the environment by investigating the impacts of metal mining. Achieving this goal requires socially
responsible mining and the development of transdisciplinary, research-based, paradigm-shifting solutions to the
multifactorial problems associated with the increased demand for metals. Such solutions require the continual
development of new research capacity. The UA SRP Research Experience and Training Coordination Core
(RETCC) supports this effort by preparing interdisciplinary graduates who are equipped to address and mitigate
complex 21st century hazardous waste challenges. The success of the UA SRP Trainee experience is evidenced
by the number of awards they receive and by their successful placement upon graduation into sought after
academic, regulatory, and industry positions. We involve undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-
docs in our training mission. As well, our Trainees are intimately involved in the scientific discoveries made by
the UA SRP and in presenting these discoveries to the science community and the general public. The goal of
our RETCC is to provide comprehensive training opportunities in science, research translation, community-
engaged research, and data management supported by interdisciplinary collaborations among our research
projects and cores. To this end, the RETCC will provide career enhancement stipends to up to ten Trainees each
year to participate in: (1) a cohort development retreat; (2) a new innovative year-long course that combines
monthly Colloquium with professional development, data analysis and management, and science
communication activities; and (3) a Community Engagement Core or Research Translation activity. Any student
or post-doc affiliated with or supported by a UA SRP project/core is eligible to be an official Trainee and
participate in our formalized RETCC activities. To achieve our goal, we have devised the following RETCC
objectives: (1) Provide Trainees access to intensive and extensive training opportunities in biomedical and
environmental sciences as well as data management and analysis; (2) Require Trainees to become familiar with
the language and culture of multiple scientific disciplines through our Colloquium and professional development,
data analysis, and science communication curriculum as well as attendance at professional meetings
encompassing different disciplines; (3) Require Trainees to participate in one research translation or community
engagement activity related to our Center goals; (4) Require Trainees to understand best practices in the
responsible conduct of research; (5) Incorporate community-engaged research concepts and experience into
each Trainee’s education; and (6) Provide multi-mentor apprenticeship opportunities to our Trainees. By
addressing our objectives, the RETCC will produce passionate, mission-driven, environmentally aware scientists
trained to address the social and ethical aspects of resource extraction and to consider the impacts of mining on
community health and well-being as well as the production, use, and reuse of metals."

one contaminant associated with mine tailings at these sites is the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Epidemiological
studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between chronic As exposure, either through drinking water
or food, with an increased incidence of diabetes. Thus, exposure to As-containing mine tailings, which could
result in inhalation or ingestion of As, may be a significant contributor to enhanced risk of disease in exposed
communities. Importantly, despite the known severity of the health effects, the molecular mechanisms by which
As-containing mine tailings enhance diabetic phenotypes have not yet been elucidated. Previously, we
reported that low, environmentally relevant doses of arsenic block autophagy, a key cellular degradation
pathway critical to maintaining proteostasis. Furthermore, we have shown that autophagic dysfunction results
in prolonged activation of the key antioxidant transcription factor NRF2. Normally maintained at low levels
through KEAP1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome, NRF2 is upregulated at the
protein level via oxidative modification of KEAP1 (KEAP1-C151 dependent, canonical) or sequestration of
Keap1 into autophagosomes during As-induced autophagy dysfunction (p62-dependent, non-canonical). While
controlled Nrf2 activation through the Keap1-C151 dependent canonical mechanism is protective, prolonged
p62-dependent non-canonical activation of NRF2 during As exposure causes cellular dysfunction and tissue
damage, indicative of a “dark side” to NRF2. We hypothesize that As-containing mine tailings promote
diabetes through p62-dependent, prolonged activation of Nrf2. This hypothesis is supported by our
preliminary data indicating that wild type (WT) mice exposed to As showed impaired glucose tolerance and
enhanced insulin resistance, which was not observed in Nrf2-/-, p62-/-, or Nrf2-/-p62-/- mice. Our recent RNAseq
data generated from the liver of mice exposed to As for 20 weeks also showed significant changes in the
expression of genes involved in glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and lipid metabolism. In this application, we will
test our hypothesis by: 1) characterizing the time and dose-dependent diabetogenic potential of chronic
exposure to As in drinking water or mine tailing As-particles (PM10) in WT mice (Aim 1); 2) determining the
role of prolonged NRF2 activation in driving As-induced metabolic reprogramming in diabetes-relevant cell
lines (Aim 2); and 3) in vivo confirmation of important molecular alterations induced by As and prolonged NRF2
activity in promoting diabetes (Aim 3). A mechanistic understanding of arsenic-mediated alterations that lead to
diabetes will prove extremely valuable in the generation of diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies
for populations exposed to As-containing mine tailings and populations at risk of arsenic exposure."

 Our overarching goal is to use new quantitative methods of capturing dynamic family interactions in early
childhood to identify key mechanisms underlying genetic and family intervention effects on substance use and
dependence (SUD) and mental health problems across adolescence. Results will demonstrate the value of
observational data analyzed with modern statistical approaches and inform the specification and refinement of
more potent and effective family-based interventions. Our approach builds on findings from large sample
genome wide association studies to inform formation of polygenic scores that represent genetic risk for SUD
and differential susceptibility to both risky and promotive family relationship dynamics. Developmental theory
on gene-environment interplay has highlighted the need to move away from focusing only on simple main
effect models, thus, we examine genetic association in the context of dynamic social interactions and random
assignment to a family-based intervention. Although SUD is heritable, it develops and progresses within
problematic family interactions and relationships. Family interventions are central to evidence-based
approaches to preventing and treating SUD, and direct observation of family interactions is the most rigorous
way of measuring family interactions. To date, the methodology and analysis of family interactions relevant to
intervening on youth SUD relies on broad aggregate scores. The most commonly used aggregate scores that
define the family interaction may simply miss pathogenic dynamics. With the advancement of statistical
analyses, there is unprecedented potential for accelerating observational family research over the coming
decade. The proposed study involves secondary analysis of existing videotaped observations of
racially/ethnically diverse children and families from the Early Steps Multisite Trial, applying dynamic structural
equation modeling and multivariate multilevel survival analysis to understand the effects of polygenic risk and
family intervention on downstream adolescent SUD and mental health problems. Early Step (N=731) is a
randomized trial with long-term follow-up (ages 2-19) of the effects of the family-centered intervention, Family
Check-Up, on reducing problem behaviors and SUD. The extensive data include videotaped observations of
children and parents across multiple contexts at ages 2, 3, 4, and 5. In addition, children were genotyped using
the contemporary Affymetrix Biobank Array. Such data provide a rare and unique opportunity to utilize new
statistical methods to understand early habitual family dynamics on SUD and mental health problems in
adolescence. These dynamic mechanisms provide key intervention targets for enhancing intervention
effectiveness and efficiency and lead to enhancing potency of family-based interventions."
10778577,"This application is a new submission extending prior research funded by HL102482, initially funded in 2009 to
identify the genetic basis for inter-individual variation in platelet function that contributes to ischemic occlusion of
arteries. We generated a human reference platelet transcriptome, developed a public, user-friendly interactive
web tool to query platelet function and RNA-protein associations, and discovered platelet aggregation through
the protease activated receptor-4 (PAR4) thrombin receptor was greater in blacks than whites. We showed
this difference was due to a PAR4 Ala120Thr substitution with racially divergent allele frequencies (Thr120:
.63 blacks; .19 whites). The Thr120 variant had increased sensitivity to thrombin and demonstrated ex vivo
thrombus formation under arterial, but not venous, shear stress. Genotyping >12,000 patients demonstrated the
Thr120 allele was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and less bleeding. More recent work has
led to new data relevant to basic and clinical aspects of platelet PAR biology, and the overall goals of the current
application are to study (1) PAR4 interactions with other GPCRs and proteases and (2) the effect of human
PAR4 (hPAR4) and the Ala120Thr variant in an in vivo model of brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. PAR4
has slower signaling kinetics than PAR1, and our new data shows that PAR4 co-immunoprecipitates with platelet
PGI2 receptor (IP). Compared to PAR4 Ala120, Thr120 is relatively resistant to desensitization in the presence
of prostacyclin (PGI2), and generates less cAMP after activation in human platelets and primary megakaryocytes
(MKs). We hypothesize IP cross-talks with PAR4, and Aim 1 will assess the role of IP/Gas in PAR signaling and
desensitization in genetically altered human MKs and platelets from our novel humanized PAR4 mouse lines.
The neutrophil serine protease, cathepsin G (CatG), is a potent platelet agonist that activates platelet PAR4,
but not PAR1, and we show CatG induces more platelet activation of PAR4 Thr120 than Ala120. For the first
time, we identified CatG enzymatic cleavage sites in PAR4, one of which generates a novel tethered ligand,
SRALLLGWVPTR, which induces human platelet aIIbb3 activation, granule release and aggregation. Aim 2 will
study CatG-platelet PAR4 interactions. Platelet PAR4, not PAR1, is critical for leukocyte recruitment, rolling and
adhesion, and our preliminary data show that murine brain I/R injury in our humanized PAR4 mouse line is hPAR4-
and neutrophil-dependent. The role of hPAR4 in stroke and brain hemorrhage after I/R injury has been poorly
studied, and the goal of Aim 3 is to utilize our hPAR4 mouse lines to determine how hPAR4 mediates platelet
and neutrophil activities in a murine stroke model, and to assess the pharmacogenetic effect of the Ala120Thr
variant on hPAR4-mediated infarct, hemorrhage and platelet signaling pathways. Successful completion of the
proposed studies is expected to enhance the understanding of the molecular basis of inter-individual variation
in human platelet biology and PAR4-expressing tissues, and provide groundwork for individualized anti-platelet
therapies in disorders with racial predilections."
10778578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of aging and as such it
associates with a rapidly growing socioeconomic burden. A hallmark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic (DA)
neurons in the substantia nigra, which is causally linked to the debilitating motor symptoms that characterize
this disease. However, motor function is not confined to the substantia nigra –other brain structures, like the
primary motor cortex (M1) that controls specific sets of motor skills, are affected in PD. Until recently, the
abnormal activity of M1 neurons observed in PD was thought to be a direct consequence of an increased basal
ganglia inhibition due to the loss of nigral DA neurons. There is now strong evidence indicating that M1 circuitry
exhibits adaptive changes in response to loss of DA neurons. Our preliminary data show numerous intrinsic
and synaptic adaptations in M1 circuitry. Yet, we lack fundamental understanding of M1 circuitry dysfunction
in PD in the context of its neuronal heterogeneity and synaptic complexity. Moreover, compelling evidence
shows M1 dysfunction occurs early in PD, but it remains unclear whether it is adaptative or maladaptive as the
disease progresses.
 In the proposed research, we will systematically study how the loss of nigral DA neurons induces
adaptative changes in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neuron subtypes in the layer 5 of M1. We will also
determine molecular and ionic mechanisms that associate with these changes (Aim 1). A combination of ex
vivo patch-clamp recording with pharmacological and biophysical approaches will be used to address these
two questions. Moreover, by combining ex vivo patch-clamp recording with optogenetics, chemogenetics, and
connectomics, how the loss of nigral DA neurons alters the connection strength and plasticity of thalamocortical
synapses will be determined (Aim 2). Last, the time course of M1 circuitry dysfunction as neurodegeneration
occurs will be studied using a mouse model that shows progressive loss of nigral DA neurons and levodopa-
responsive motor deficits. In these studies, M1 circuitry dysfunction will be related to the development of motor
deficits to determine its role in the onset and progression of motor dysfunction (Aim 3).
 The information arising from the proposed research will fill the gap in knowledge regarding M1 circuitry
dysfunction associated with the loss of nigral DA neurons. This knowledge will aid the identification of novel
physiological biomarkers for PD progression and the design of noninvasive approaches targeting M1 for
treatment of motor dysfunction in PD."

Hemolytic syndromes including sickle cell disease (SCD) are devastating illnesses that affect over
100,000 people in the United States. Each of these patients suffers a broad spectrum of cardiopulmonary
complications and exercise intolerance caused by red blood cell hemolysis, high plasma levels of cell
free hemoglobin (Hb), endothelial cell dysfunction, and tissue hypoxia. Pulmonary vascular disease in
the form of pulmonary hypertension, is significantly increased in this population, without any adequate
treatment options. This grant application and projects herein focus on elucidating the mechanistic un-
derpinnings of macrophage activation and their contribution to the progression of SCD PH.
Our data shows a unique macrophage (Mϕ) phenotype occurs in both deceased adult SCD patients di-
agnosed with PH as well rodent models of SCD PH. This phenotype is described by intracellular accu-
mulation of Hb, expression of HO-1, and mitogenic, inflammatory and vasoconstrictor mediators that
are also associated with hypoxia (HX) induced PH. Furthermore, like hypoxia driven PH, SCD patient
lung macrophages accumulate in the pulmonary adventitial regions surrounding remodeled pre-capillary
pulmonary arterioles that show plexiform lesions and re-canalization of small pulmonary arterioles. The
phenotypic similarities between rodent models and human SCD with PH indicate a novel maladaptive
immune response to concomitant bouts of Hb and HX exposure. Moreover, by knocking out circulating
mϕs in a rat model of group 5 PH, the response to combined Hb and hypobaric HX was significantly at-
tenuated in rats, suggesting a critical role for mϕs in the exacerbation of SCD PH. We hypotheses
that persistent bouts of hypoxia-induced erythrocyte sickling are a critical process that drives
Mϕ removal of damaged RBCs causing accumulation of Mϕ iron, loss of Mϕ iron homeostasis
and progressive SCD-PH. We further hypothesize that impaired iron homeostasis facilitates in-
tracellular oxidation and exposes the local pulmonary vascular micro-environments to labile
iron mediated oxidation and accelerated lung peripheral vascular remodeling. To test this hypoth-
esis we propose the following specific aims.
Aim 1 will determine how circulating monocytes with a high iron content are metabolically reprogramed
in patients with differing severity of SCD. Aim 2 in vivo and in vitro will determine the contribution and
mechanism by which iron loaded Mϕ contribute to SCD; and Aim 3 will test the effectiveness of trans-
ferrin, ferroportin inhibitor, and iron chelators alone or in combination as a therapeutic intervention to
halt Mϕ contributions to SCD PH.
An in-depth understanding of these relationships will allow us to identify new therapeutic targets to
pulmonary hypertension concomitant with SCD."

We propose to establish an innovative summer training program to introduce fundamental principles of
biostatistics and data science to a diverse pool of promising undergraduate and beginning graduate students for
careers as quantitative scientists with a focus on biomedical research. The proposed seven-week program,
Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics and Data Science at Columbia (SIBDS@Columbia), will be
taught by a pool of world-renowned faculty with expertise and extensive funded research in several key areas of
biostatistics and data science, hailing from diverse backgrounds and including women, African, Latino, and first
in their family to attain a college education, with passion for hands-on mentoring of students and diversity in the
workforce. Trainees will have the opportunity to interact with world-class experts in domain areas relevant to the
missions of NHLBI and NIAID and will be immersed in research through carefully designed projects utilizing
quantitative skills acquired from the program on data from studies involving heart, lung, blood, and sleep
disorders and infectious disease epidemiology. The program will be housed within the Department of Biostatistics
at Columbia University, which has a long and successful history of training promising undergraduate students
from diverse backgrounds through its long-running BEST (Biostatistics and Epidemiology Summer Training)
Diversity Program and past cycles of the Columbia SIBS (CSIBS) program. Under the proposed training program,
we will create a pipeline complimentary to (and synergistic with) the existing BEST program by focusing on state-
of-the-art data science skills, as opposed to the BEST program’s focus on the intersection of biostatistics and
epidemiology. There will also be new innovations to demonstrate the value of biostatistics and data science in
interdisciplinary research and also a new added focus on research of infectious diseases. Specifically, we
propose to (i) identify and recruit a diverse and quantitatively skilled group of 14 undergraduate and beginning
graduate college students every summer; (ii) immerse trainee cohorts in a carefully designed curriculum of
fundamental concepts of biostatistics and data science, computing skills, and hands-on biomedical data analysis;
(iii) mentor trainees on professional development toward graduate studies in biostatistics and data science and
subsequent careers; and (iv) ensure success of trainees by a well-structured tracking system through degree
completion, pursuit of graduate studies, and subsequent careers as quantitative scientists. Given Columbia’s
reputation as a major research hub, its extensive portfolio in NIH-funded research, its expert faculty and mentors,
an existing network of successful alumni from previous BEST/CSIBS cycles as models for trainees, and its
location in ethnically diverse and culturally rich New York City, we are poised to continue to contribute
substantially toward expanding a diverse pool of well-trained biostatisticians and data scientists that can handle
the complex data analyses needed to address today’s most pressing research questions."
10778552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The number of older adults (aged≥55) undergoing live donor nephrectomy has quadrupled over the last two
decades and this trend is likely to continue. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the
resiliencies to physical stress in older donors. Beyond age-related vulnerability to surgical stress, this aging
population may have significant glomerular senescence, an inadequate adaptive response to the 50% loss of
nephron mass and, as such, a very high likelihood of CKD in their lifetime. Approximately 80% of older donors
have a postdonation GFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2 and meet the standard definition of CKD. As older donors
progress towards CKD, they are likely to become frail and, as such, at increased risk of hospitalization.
No study has focused on the identification of clinical signatures of resiliency in older persons undergoing live
donor nephrectomy. The renal system is directly impacted by nephrectomy and its resiliency may affect the
health and well-being of older donors. Provider discussions with these potential donors should focus on the
patient's most important question: “Can I safely donate my kidney?” not the population-level question asked by
the 2017 KDIGO guidelines: “How many ESRD events in younger donors may be averted by transplanting
older donors instead?”
We propose the following scientific aims: 1. To quantify donation-attributable risk of ESRD and mortality in
older donors; 2. To describe the prevalence of hospitalizations in older donors vs. older nondonors; and 3. To
implement a risk calculator for ESRD, mortality and sentinel hospitalization in older donors.
A detailed training plan for Abimereki Muzaale, MD, MPH is outlined in this proposal. In brief, it includes
enrollment in the PhD in Clinical Investigation Program at The Johns Hopkins University, in-depth course work
in aging research, and a mentorship plan jointly prepared by the principal investigator and a team with
expertise in kidney disease, aging research, information sciences, and the mentorship of junior faculty. This
team will help the candidate meet the following career goals: (1) Receive formal training in aging research; (2)
Apply for and obtain R01 grant funding; and (3) Transition to independence.
Our efforts will culminate in the creation of online risk calculators that inform the conversation between
candidates and providers about the propriety of donation. Dr. Muzaale will learn how sentinel hospitalization
events in an aging cohort of older donors leave a footprint of present and missing data that will be methodically
crucial in preparing an R01 proposal to characterize trajectories of resiliency from laboratory, physical,
cognitive, and other tests."

 Our program is devoted to understanding the function of biologically central transition metals. We here
focus on three key roles of transition-ion centers, and have assembled outstanding multidisciplinary teams to
attack them. The approaches to each incorporate a suite of advanced paramagnetic resonance techniques,
EPR/ENDOR/ESEEM, many of which we have developed. (a) 'Radical-SAM (S-adenosyl methionine)'
Enzymes: This enzyme superfamily is Nature's most widespread means of performing essential radical-based
chemistry. (i) With Broderick, we have demonstrated that throughout the superfamily, reductive SAM cleavage
generates an organometallic intermediate, Omega, central to catalysis. We will probe the properties and reactivity of
Omega through EPR/ENDOR studies of multiple Omega's, in parallel with studies of synthetic Omega-analogs prepared by
Suess. (ii) We revealed that regioselective cleavage of the SAM S−C5’ bond to generate Omega upon SAM
reduction is Jahn-Teller (JT) enabled and active-site controlled. To understand this phenomenon we will study
it with a selected suite of SAM analogues bound in a correspondingly selected suite of RS enzymes, while
computationally exploring the fundamentals of the process with Mosquera. (iii) We will expand the study of the
RS catalytic mechanism, examining substrate transformations by epimerases and spliceases. (b) Mechanism
of Nitrogenase activation: With Dean, Seefeldt, and Raugei we have revealed how the nitrogenase MoFe
protein is activated to carry out perhaps the most challenging chemical transformation in biology, the reduction
of the N≡N triple bond, and have shown that the alternative V- and Fe-nitrogenases employ the same
mechanism. This latter finding will enable us to explore the structure of nitrogenase intermediates throughout
the entire catalytic cycle, using 1,2H/14N ENDOR of substrates. A remarkable achievement of Dean enables us to
monitor the 13C ENDOR of carbide central to the FeMo-co active center, as well. This study is enhanced through
the use of site-selectively 57Fe-labeled FeMo-co in enzyme prepared by Suess, a major advance in integrating
structure and function. (c) in vivo Mn2+ Speciation: We earlier established that EPR/ENDOR/ESEEM
provide an otherwise unavailable means of characterizing Mn2+ complexes in live cells. Our collaboration with
Daly now has shown that Mn2+ speciation is the strongest biological indicator of cellular resistance to ionizing
radiation (IR) throughout the tree of life. In the coming period we will explore a discovery of and correlation
between in vivo Mn2+ speciation, IR resistance, and aging, and test the hypothesis that our spectroscopies can
be used to devise optimized radiotherapy regimens for human tumors. In a dramatic new venture, a
collaboration with O'Halloran surprisingly indicates that Mn2+ ions play an important role in fertilization of
amphibian oocytes, and we will broaden and expand our studies of Mn2+ speciation by examining fertilization in
mammals. Synergy: Each of the enzyme systems addressed a problem of fundamental importance, while the
diversity of these Aims synergistically benefits each one."

Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or
recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths
annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to-
end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis (excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the
most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for
evaluation, typically using histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of
collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can
be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and
a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and
additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process.
We propose to optimize, deploy, and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and
Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection
and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly
from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will
finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging
performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components,
and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of
Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared
with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites.
The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal
pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of
DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive, and practical approach for the rapid and accurate
evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with
significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes."

 The proposed research is designed to illuminate how semantic organization emerges in the course of
development, and how it contributes to the fundamentally human ability to comprehend language. The
proposed research will be guided by two general hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that comprehension may
fundamentally rely on semantic organization – an organized network of words. The second hypothesis is that
semantic organization emerges from exposure to statistical regularities in language input and from the
developing ability to extract these regularities. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct three studies with 4-9-
year-old children, and adults. The proposed project has the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to
conduct a cross-sectional training study (Study 1), presenting 4- to 9-year-old children and adults with
controlled, varied exposure to sentences containing novel words that are rich in regularities, and testing how
the amount of exposure and the ability to form semantic links affect subsequent comprehension. Specific Aim 2
is to recruit 4-year-old children and use a longitudinal design to examine how exposure to language and
maturation of ability to form semantic links affect the development of semantic organization (Study 2). Specific
Aim 3 is to use a longitudinal design (with the same sample as Study 2) to examine whether the development
of semantic organization drives improvements in language comprehension. The proposed project will advance
our understanding of a critical component of typical cognitive and language development and inform
theoretically-based enrichment programs for atypical language development."

Despite the availability of efficient technologies and rapidly accumulating data, the function and mutation
characteristics of many regions of the genome remain enigmatic. One way to solve this puzzle is through the
lens of evolution. The Makova Laboratory uses a combination of experimental and computational techniques to
study human genome evolution. The overarching goals are to decipher the mechanistic and evolutionary
processes generating genome variation and shaping genome architecture and to uncover the function of, and
selection acting on, different parts of the genome. During the next five years, the laboratory’s focus will be on
decoding the role of non-canonical (non-B) DNA structures in genome evolution. At certain sequence motifs,
DNA is capable of assuming conformations that are different from the classical right-handed double-helix with
10 base pairs per turn (i.e. B DNA). Such motifs constitute as much as 13% of the human genome. Non-B
DNA structures include G-quadruplexes, cruciforms, DNA triplexes, and Z-DNA. Their formation is transient. It
is sensitive to signals during cell differentiation and development and can b triggered by certain conditions in
the cell, including oxidative and replication stress. Non-B DNA motifs are present across the tree of life, and
abundant experimental evidence indicates non-B DNA structure formation in mammalian cells. Non-B DNA
structures can be viewed as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, their transient formation regulates a
multitude of fundamental molecular processes, including the initiation of transcription and of replication. On the
other hand, such structures may impede replication, causing increased mutagenesis and chromosomal
rearrangements. At present, it is not well understood how non-B structures evolve and influence genome
evolution. Of particular interest are the following questions. Do non-B DNA structures affect the progression of
replication forks in living cells? Do non-B DNA structures elevate rates of mutations in germline cells and thus
serve as mutation hotspots in evolution? Where in the genome do non-B DNA structures evolve under
purifying selection and thus are functional? How do evolutionary changes in non-B DNA structures affect their
functions? To address these and other questions, we will use specialized experimental and computational
approaches and will exploit the complete, telomere-to-telomere, human and ape genome assemblies. These
assemblies and approaches will provide a unique opportunity to study non-B DNA structures, which can serve
as versatile switches and fine-tunable regulators of variation in molecular processes at different evolutionary
time scales—among individual humans, among ape species, and beyond. Addressing the questions of the
proposal will illuminate the mechanisms generating human genetic variation, will assist in accurate construction
of models in population genetics and molecular evolution, will bring us closer to complete functional annotation
of the genome, and, in the future, will inform personalized medicine."
10763017,"ABSTRACT
Chronic wound care is especially complicated by the formation of bacterial biofilms, commonly by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus. Biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy,
which is an important reason why chronic wound infections are so difficult to eradicate. There is a significant
need to discover new strategies to combat biofilms. Bacterial iron homeostasis is a suitable novel target for
developing anti-infectives because the host makes essential iron scarce to invading pathogens. Bacteria have
evolved mechanisms to “steal” iron from their host, but these depend on well-regulated iron homeostasis. To
disrupt bacterial iron homeostasis, we are targeting the iron storage protein BfrB and its physiological partner
protein, Bfd, which are unique to bacteria. Our work has shown that BfrB regulates cytosolic iron concentrations
by (a) oxidizing Fe2+ and storing up to ~3,000 Fe3+ ions in its internal cavity, and (b) forming a complex with Bfd
to reduce Fe3+ in the internal cavity of BfrB and release Fe2+ to the cytosol for its incorporation in metabolism.
Blocking the BfrB-Bfd complex in P. aeruginosa cells by deletion of the bfd gene perturbs iron homeostasis by
triggering an irreversible accumulation of Fe3+ in BfrB and simultaneous cytosolic iron depletion, which leads to
impaired biofilm maintenance and biofilm cell death. Our work also led to the discovery of proof-of-concept
inhibitors of the BfrB-Bfd complex, which bind BfrB at the Bfd binding site, inhibit iron mobilization, and elicit
biofilm cell death. The objectives of this application are to improve the proof-of-concept molecules into lead
molecules, evaluate their antibacterial and antibiofilm effectiveness, and evaluate their potential drug suitability.
Our interdisciplinary team includes expertise in chemical and structural biology of bacterial iron homeostasis
(Rivera), organic synthesis and reaction mechanisms (Bunce), pharmaceutical industry research and
development of anti-infectives (Reitz), X-ray crystallography in drug discovery (Lovell), microbial genetics
(Chandler), and animal model of infection (Morici). The specific aims are: 1) Evolve proof-of-concept analogs
into potent inhibitors of the BfrB-Bfd complex. This work will follow a systematic, iterative strategy of medicinal
chemistry synthesis optimization that relies on crystal structures of inhibitor bound BfrB to design each new
generation of inhibitors. 2) Asses the antibacterial effectiveness of inhibitors of the BfrB-Bfd complex and
evaluate their potential drug suitability."
10763018,"Summary: Dr. Weatherhead is an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases
at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and a physician-scientist in the area of immunoparasitology. Her career
goal is to be an expert in parasitic health disparities and perform high-quality basic science research that
improves the health of children living in poverty. Children living in poverty are at high risk of parasitic infections
such as ascariasis, which infects over 800 million children and is associated with significant morbidity including
allergic airway disease. Dr. Weatherhead aims to dissect the complex host immune response to ascariasis in
order to highlight novel interventions that are urgently needed to prevent morbidity in children living in poverty.
Her unique skill set will allow her to serve as a link between laboratory discovery and field implementation of
newly developed anthelminthic targets. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Weatherhead has developed a
comprehensive career development plan which combines thorough mentoring and training activities integrated
into her basic and translational research program. She will have scheduled meetings with her invested
mentorship team, Dr. David Corry, an authority in molecular immunology and allergic airway disease, and Dr.
Peter Hotez, a global leader in parasitology and vaccine development. Dr. Weatherhead will receive additional
expert-level mentorship on the microbial-host immune interface from her scientific advisory committee.
Mentored research will be supplemented with formal training activities including graduate-level coursework,
participation in national scientific meetings and instruction in scientific communication and academic
leadership. Her career development plan is supported by a world-class scientific environment which offers
ample opportunities for junior faculty development and provides all the resources needed to achieve her career
goals. Dr. Weatherhead's research will evaluate the innate and adaptive immunologic mechanism by which
Ascaris larval lung migration induces allergic airway disease. The first aim will define the molecular pathway
involved in innate immune activation during pulmonary ascariasis. The second aim will determine when and for
how long the host loses peripheral immune tolerance as a result of Ascaris-induced adaptive immune
activation. Both aims will evaluate the immune pathways in the presence and absence of protease activity.
Questions outlined in this proposal are highly significant to the field of tropical medicine and parasitology
having the potential to shift our understanding of the complex parasite-host relationship, lending support to the
hypothesis that ascariasis is a leading cause of allergic airway disease in endemic regions. This proposal will
advance the comprehension of the mechanistic pathways of Ascaris-induced allergic airway disease as well as
provide therapeutic insight into asthma in general, suggesting novel interventional targets that are critically
needed to prevent morbidity in children. The mentored career development activities proposed in this
application will allow Dr. Weatherhead to evolve as an independent investigator in immunoparasitology."
10915576,"The World Health Organization has declared that antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest threats to global
health. It was estimated that by 2050, deaths due to drug resistant bacteria will exceed those caused by cancer.
The goal of this project is to develop a new ureadepsipeptide antibiotic (UDEP) to treat infections caused by
Gram-positive pathogens, such as bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and prosthetic joint infections. UDEPs
have a unique mechanism of action – they kill bacteria by causing cells to digest their own proteins. This
mechanism enables activity against non-growing and dormant cells of bacteria that traditional antibiotics cannot
kill. Thus, UDEPs have the potential to fill a large and unmet medical need for biofilm-related and difficult to treat
infections. UDEP target what the CDC classifies as serious and concerning drug-resistant threats including
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Drug-
Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Erythromycin-Resistant
Group A Streptococcus, and Clindamycin-Resistant Group B Streptococcus. The goal of this project is to
determine if a new UDEP called 5192, which was specifically designed to have a low frequency of resistance, is
a suitable candidate to enter investigational new drug enabling non-clinical development so it can be tested in
human trials in the future."

patient survival of 12-15 months and five-year survival of less than 5%. The current standard of therapy for
GBM comprises surgical resection then radiation and chemotherapy. However, due to the heterogeneity and
invasive nature of GBM tumor cells there is a high rate (~80%) of tumor recurrence, leading to dismal survival
rates that have not changed significantly in over 50 years. One of the primary hurdles to improving these out-
comes is the lack of reliable and accurate means to monitor tumor progression and treatment response. The
current standard methods of tumor monitoring, direct tissue biopsy and external imaging, are not able to safely
provide accurate, focal, longitudinal information about the tumor progression and treatment response that
would allow clinicians to modify treatment regimen to improve survival outcomes. Here we propose the Tumor
Monorail as a platform that allows direct, serial access to tumor material, providing critical information about
tumors in real time that will help clinicians improve active treatment management and patient survival.
The Tumor Monorail is a Breakthrough Designated device and has been the subject of multiple FDA pre-sub-
mission meetings and extensive verification and biocompatibility testing. By leveraging design and material se-
lections with a long history of safe clinical use, the Tumor Monorail can safely provide access to this typically
inaccessible tumor in an outpatient setting. This will provide clinicians with an unprecedented amount of infor-
mation about tumor genetics and treatment response in real time that is critically important to improving out-
comes for the treatment of GBM. The potential impact of this paradigm shifting diagnostic tool is wide ranging,
including enhancing the efficacy of current standard of care and novel treatment regimens, increasing clinical
trial efficiency by accelerating patient placement and data collection, removing uncertainty about treatment effi-
cacy and tumor progression inherent in imaging, and more.
The aims of this proposal are focused on optimization and clinical translation of the Tumor Monorail as a plat-
form for longitudinal GBM sampling. In the Phase 1 portion of the proposal we will first optimize the sampling
ability and cellular migration in the device and perform multiple pre-clinical verification tests that will improve
usability and ease regulatory approval. In the Phase II portion we will validate the device efficacy in concert
with standard of care treatment in a rodent model and perform more FDA requested pre-clinical testing that will
confirm long term explantability, clinical usability, and preparation of the device for rapid clinical translation.
These activities will ensure that the Tumor Monorail is well positioned for submission of an Investigational De-
vice Exemption (IDE), clinical translation, and rapid adoption to provide a new treatment path for GBM focused
on active disease management and individually targeted, responsive treatment that would allow clinicians to
tailor interventions in real time, increasing patient outcomes that have been stagnant for decades."

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are one of the most problematic of legacy pollutants. Persistent and mobile in
the environment, PCBs are largely ubiquitous in depositional sediments of aquatic systems in industrial regions
of the United States. Their relatively high toxicity and bioaccumulation potential cause elevated risk to both
human and ecological receptors. As such, PCBs are often the primary risk driver at Superfund sediment sites.
Common practices for remediating PCB-impacted sediments are costly, often involving the physical removal of
contaminated sediments and disposal of the sediments in a confined landfill, and/or installation of a multi-layered
engineered cap over the contaminated sediments.
An emerging strategy for effectively removing PCBs from sediments in situ is the use of bio-amended activated
carbon (AC), which employs AC pellets inoculated with enriched cultures of PCB-degrading microbes. The co-
investigators of this proposed research have performed the fundamental research behind the use of bio-
amended AC for remediation of PCBs in sediment and have patented commercially-viable methods for growing,
inoculating, and delivering the bioamended AC pellets to sediments. The prior Phase I project, a collaboration
between university scientists and RemBac Environmental, addressed two factors that limit the ready use of this
technology for large, multi-acre sites: 1) the large-scale growth, storage, and transport of anaerobic PCB
degrading bacteria, and; 2) large-scale methods for inoculating and deploying the bioamended AC pellets. The
PCB halorespiring anaerobe was successfully scaled up to the maximum density in a bench-scale bioreactor,
methods were developed for storage of cells by lyophilization and two approaches were successfully tested for
the continuous, uniform inoculation of high volumes of AC pellets with the PCB-degrading microorganisms.
The proposed research will advance the technology towards commercialization by demonstrating the efficacy of
the methods developed in Phase I for scaled up production at a commercial facility, and perform a pilot-scale
demonstration of the technology at the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site (NBHSS). PCB degrading
microorganisms will be scaled up to cell numbers sufficient to treat over 1 acre, and AC pellets will be inoculated
on-site using methods developed in Phase I to assess the efficacy of the application methods in a tidal marsh.
PCB levels in sediment and water will be assayed after one year to 1) assess the effectiveness and
environmental impact of the treatment, and 2) assess the stability of the treatment with tidal activity. Finally, a
cost analysis conducted for the entire process to assess the commercial viability of bio-amended AC as a cost-
effective treatment for PCB impacted sites. The proposed research is anticipated to result in a direct transfer of
this technology from pilot-scale to full commercial viability through an active collaboration with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), engineering consultants,
and Superfund site stakeholders."
10875274,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a major public health problem that is characterized by a vast expansion of adipose tissue. Under
conditions of chronic excess energy intake, adipocytes expand to store surplus nutrients. In obesity, chronically
enlarged adipocytes can no longer respond to insulin, properly secrete insulin-sensitizing hormones, or retain
excess lipids, which then deposit in tissues such as liver and muscle where they hinder insulin action. Obesity-
linked adipocyte dysfunction drives the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Agents that can revert obesity-driven adipocyte defects and restore
normal lipid partitioning amongst tissues are useful insulin sensitizers in humans.
The Saez and Cravatt labs previously developed an innovative strategy that integrates phenotypic screening
with chemical proteomics to streamline the identification of protein targets of bioactive small molecules and
rapidly uncover new metabolic targets on a proteome-wide scale. By screening unique libraries of small
molecules for desirable phenotypes in adipocytes (e.g., increased lipid retention), they identified in tandem
physiologically relevant proteins and chemical tools to perturb the function of these proteins to expedite their
functional characterization and therapeutic validation in T2D. In past work, they applied this strategy to study
adipocyte physiology, and identified and therapeutically validated new targets for T2D (e.g., Ces3, PGRMC2).
In this project, I will advance this ligand-protein target discovery strategy by screening for desirable effects in
adipocytes (e.g., increased lipid retention) a library of chemical probes that are stereochemically defined. The
introduction of stereochemistry allows for a set of chemical probes to have similar physiochemical properties,
yet differ in the ability to engage proteins, thus facilitating the identification of the relevant protein targets of
bioactive probes. My goal is to apply this integrated phenotypic screening and chemical proteomics strategy
using this new library of stereoselective probes to discover metabolic pathways that can be pharmacologically
modulated to revert obesity-induced adipocyte defects. It is my expectation that some of the novel pathways I
discover may provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for obesity-linked conditions.
Extensive preliminary data included in the proposal establishes the feasibility of this approach. I have already
identified several probes that stereoselectively promote adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage. In one
instance, I have also identified the proteins that interact with the proadipogenic compound. Thus, I am poised to
identify novel metabolic pathways that can be targeted to treat obesity-driven maladies."
10925238,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Inflammatory skin diseases are often multifactorial, with influences from genetics and environmental factors that
cause immune dysregulation and impair skin barrier integrity. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin
and is fundamental to maintaining skin barrier integrity. Also, epidermal skin cells play a primary role in the
recruitment and regulation of immune cells upon disruption of homeostasis. The mechanisms that govern the
crosstalk between the epidermis and the immune system have yet to be fully elucidated. Current strategies in
treating inflammatory skin disease include the administration of corticosteroids and retinoids, which may have
unwanted side effects with prolonged use. Therefore, there is a need for a better mechanistic understanding of
the crosstalk between the epidermis and the immune system to develop more targeted approaches to treat
inflammatory skin disease. Recent reports have implicated SNPs in genes that may play a role in inflammatory
skin diseases. One such gene is Ovol1. Ovol1 is a transcriptional repressor of immune cell recruitment and is
necessary for maintaining skin homeostasis and regulating proper embryonic epidermis development. Ablation
of Ovol1 in psoriasis-like and atopic dermatitis animal models exacerbates disease with an increase of infiltrating
neutrophils. Ablation of neutrophils improves disease outcomes.
Neutrophils are the principal innate immune responders forming the first line of defense against pathogenic
invaders or sterile damages. Neutrophils have an arsenal of effector functions, including the engulfment of
pathogens, release of proteases, extracellular trap formation, and release of reactive oxygen species.
Appropriately, neutrophils have a destructive potential that requires stringent regulation of recruitment to avoid
excess collateral damage to the host. Our preliminary data show that in the absence of epidermal Ovol1, the
recruitment of neutrophils to the injured skin increases in minutes. This observation suggests that Ovol1 has a
gatekeeping function and prevents the excessive production of neutrophil chemoattractants after skin injury. My
central hypothesis is that Ovol1 regulates the production of leukotrienes as well as the expression of
chemokines before or minutes after wounding. The absence of epidermal Ovol1 primes the skin for neutrophil
infiltration, in turn exacerbating inflammatory skin disease. In this proposal, I will address two aims to support my
hypothesis: 1) Evaluate the role of leukotrienes in the excessive recruitment of neutrophils in the absence of
epidermal Ovol1, 2) Identify and block chemokines expressed early after skin injury when Ovol1 is absent. The
proposed research will untangle the early crosstalk between the epidermis and the innate immune system,
potentially revealing better pharmacological targets to alleviate inflammatory skin disease."

 In response to damage from injury or disease, lost neurons in the adult mammalian retina are
irreplaceable which can lead to visual impairment including blindness. Some non-mammalian vertebrates,
such as teleost fish, can regenerate the retina in response to damage via the Müller glia. In teleost fish, Müller
glia will respond to signals from damaged neurons by asymmetrically dividing to produce retinal progenitor
cells. These progenitor cells then differentiate into neuronal cell types and functionally restore tissue.
 Mammalian Müller glia are quiescent and do not display regenerative capacity in response to damage.
However, mammalian Müller glia demonstrate some cell state plasticity and can be reprogrammed into
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in vitro. Mammalian Müller glia likely have the capacity for
reprogramming but lack the cell intrinsic- or extrinsic-signaling necessary to do so.
 I have found that overexpression of L-Myc, a robust reprogramming factor used to reprogram many
somatic cell types to iPSCs, leads to cell cycle re-entry in adult mammalian Müller glia in ex vivo retinal tissue.
Using murine retinal explant tissue as an injury model, I will characterize the effects of L-Myc overexpression
on proliferation and dedifferentiation in mammalian Müller glia. I hypothesize that L-Myc overexpression in
Müller glia leads to direct and indirect changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility that reprogram
Müller glia toward a progenitor-like state. To test this hypothesis, I will first characterize the effects of L-Myc
expression on proliferation. I will do so by defining the interval of proliferation as it relates to L-Myc expression
and determining if Müller glia or their descendants are able to divide repeatedly following L-Myc
overexpression. Next, I will characterize the effect of L-Myc overexpression in Müller glia on cell identity and
gene regulation. Using data integration of RNA-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and CUT&Tag of FACS sorted
L-Myc overexpressing Müller glia, I will identify gene regulatory networks affected directly or indirectly by L-Myc
overexpression and identify changes in cell state.
 Combining Müller glia, a highly promising population within the mammalian retina for reprogramming,
and L-Myc, a potent reprogramming factor to promote proliferation and dedifferentiation, creates an ideal
scenario to reveal targets to promote regeneration in the mammalian retina through the analysis of gene
regulatory networks activated or inhibited by L-Myc overexpression. Regardless of the cell state changes that
occur in response to L-Myc overexpression in Müller glia, this project will reveal what signaling barriers exist
that prevent tissue regeneration via Müller glia in the mammalian retina. This study is designed to identify
future targets for genetic therapies to promote restoration of tissue and visual function after injury in the
mammalian retina, which one day could lead to treatments for currently untreatable visual diseases."

Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) constitutes a traumatic stress environment and incurs profound
impacts on both mothers’ caregiving and children’s’ mental health outcomes. Children who are exposed to IPV
are more likely to develop a variety of psychopathology. Sensitive and responsive caregiving has been
identified as an important protective factor that may buffer the negative impact of IPV exposure. The
Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) has demonstrated positive treatment effects on
child mental health problems and is currently being adapted and evaluated in the sponsor’s RCT
(R01HD102436; PI: Sharp) for African American IPV-exposed mothers in a community partner organization’s
rehousing program. While MISC holds promise for this population, no data has yet been collected to evaluate
whether MISC is amenable to scale-up for delivery in community organization settings. This translational
research gap is significant because of the high prevalence of IPV exposure in African American families (1 in 4
African American children in the U.S. are exposed to IPV) and the paucity of available data on factors related
to the adoption of IPV-parenting interventions. Consistent with the NIMH’s strategic objectives 3 (prevention of
mental illness) and 4 (public health impact), the proposed research will evaluate the evidence-based MISC
parenting intervention for implementation using
mixed methodology
and the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR) for scale-up in two IPV-community organization settings. This project will
identify key barriers and facilitators to the implementation of MISC that will be incorporated in a future scale-up
and evaluation project in an additional research proposal. Using CFIR constructs
in a parallel convergent
design
, the following
mixed method
aims will be completed. For Aim 1, we will identify MISC Characteristics for
scale-up suitability using qualitative interviews (N=10) with MISC-Implementation experts (caseworkers and
administrative leaders who are implementing MISC in their IPV organization in the sponsor’s RCT). Interviews
will focus on the perception of MISC and how it may fit into their existing workload. For Aim 2, we will assess
outer setting characteristics for MISC scale-up suitability via quantitative survey of stakeholders (N=50) in the
IPV field. Surveys will focus on policies and incentives that drive IPV initiatives. For Aim 3, we will assess inner
setting characteristics at two community partner agencies via focus groups with IPV caseworkers (N=20) to
explore factors related to workload and culture.
Each aim will identify salient barriers and facilitators to
implementation related to each CFIR construct and comprehensive recommendations will be created based on
these findings for future scale-up.
The proposed project will be the first to evaluate the capacity and feasibility
of adoption of an evidence-based caregiver intervention in an IPV-community organization setting and will
extend the literature to consider multi-level factors in implementing community-based interventions."
10754502,"The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, rapidly evolves drug resistance, creating
the urgent need for new treatment strategies. A critical barrier to identifying and developing new
drug development targets is a knowledge gap regarding most essential processes and regulatory
pathways. Ideally, new targets should be highly conserved and be unable or have limited ability
to mutate in order to evolve resistance. Parasite mitochondrial function is critically essential
across all the life stages and differs substantially from the human organelle; however, most
mitochondrial proteins have yet to be identified in malaria parasites. During the intraerythrocytic
development cycle (IDC), P. falciparum is supported by a single mitochondrion containing about
~20 copies of the 6 kb genome, characterized by extensive recombination. IDC parasite
mitochondria do not make cristae to insert electron transport chain (ETC) enzymes, thus the
organelle may have evolved unique transcription or translation repression systems to limit
expression of the mitochondrial encoded genes. Results from our integrative approach combining
whole genome sequencing and metabolic profiling, suggests a link between mitochondrial gene
expression regulation and resistance to ETC inhibitors, potentially due to recombination. Thus,
we hypothesize that 1) a feature of the multicopy status is retention of cryptic mitochondrial
genome copies encoding mutant alleles, which can be recombined for survival. 2) P. falciparum
mitochondria use previously uncharacterized gene expression systems, for repression and
activation which are unique to this organelle. The current objectives are to identify the source of
recombination between mitochondrial genomes and its contribution to drug resistance as well as
to determine the mitochondrial DNA repair pathways and transcriptional machinery of the
mitochondria using single-organelle approaches. This proposal will identify and define previously
unknown and uncharacterized aspects of parasite biology, with the goal of advancing rational
drug design. These studies will refine our knowledge about the basic mechanism of gene
regulation in the malaria mitochondria. Investigating the mechanisms underpinning these effects
will lead to the identification of highly conserved drug development targets."
10841589,"Smooth muscle Ca2+ signaling mechanisms are crucial regulators of arterial contraction and blood
pressure. Abnormalities in arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) Ca2+ signaling mechanisms have
been linked to vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling, and blood pressure elevation in
hypertension. Therefore, identifying a new Ca2+ signaling mechanism could provide fresh impetus
for designing novel therapeutic targets that lower blood pressure in hypertension. In this regard,
TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) ion channels are a well-known Ca2+-influx pathway
in SMCs. Using smooth muscle-specific TRPV4-knockout mice, we provided first evidence that
SMC TRPV4 channels increase resting blood pressure and contribute to blood pressure elevation
in hypertension. Moreover, our preliminary data demonstrate two TRPV4 channel-containing
signaling nanodomains in SMCs with opposite functional effects: (1) constrictor nanodomains
involving nerve stimulation-induced activation of α1 adrenergic receptors (α1ARs)–protein kinase
C (PKC)-anchoring protein AKAP150–TRPV4 channel signaling; and (2) dilator nanodomains
activated by intraluminal pressure and comprising caveolin-1 scaffolded Piezo1–TRPV4–Ca2+-
activated K+ (BK) channel signaling. Further, we show that constrictor α1AR–TRPV4 channel
signaling is accentuated in arteries from a mouse model of hypertension and hypertensive
patients, whereas dilator TRPV4–BK channel signaling is reduced. We hypothesize that
miscommunication between the signaling elements disrupts the balance between constrictor and
dilator signaling nanodomains and leads to blood pressure elevation in hypertension. In Aim 1,
we will use smooth muscle-specific knockout mice, protein co-localization, patch-clamp
electrophysiology, and blood pressure radiotelemetry to determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying the excessive activation of constrictor α1AR:AKAP150:PKC:TRPV4 nanodomains in
hypertension. In Aim 2, we will determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reduced
activity of dilator Piezo1:TRPV4:BK channel nanodomains scaffolded by caveolin-1 in
hypertension. The clinical relevance of studies in each Aim will be established by experiments in
arteries from non-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals. Collectively, the proposed studies
will establish novel SMC Ca2+-signaling nanodomains that control blood pressure and identify
specific impairments at these nanodomains in hypertension."
10931564,"Resistance to standard of care (SOC) temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation treatment (XRT) limits survival of the
most common adult brain cancer, glioblastoma (GBM), to 12-18 months. Despite promising results in other
cancers, robust immunosuppression in GBM has also limited the responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs). Reciprocal interactions in the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) between mesenchymal changes and
immunosuppression enhance resistance to chemoradiation and immunotherapy, respectively. Therefore, a
compelling therapeutic strategy for GBM is to concurrently reprogram the mesenchymal and immune
suppressive TMEs and potentiate ICI and SOC therapy. The NR4A1 and NR4A2 orphan nuclear receptors are
compelling targets to achieve this goal. We synthesized a series of novel bis-indole–derived ligands (CDIMs)
with potent dual antagonism of NR4A1 and NR4A2 and negligible in vivo toxicity, of which six demonstrated nM
range KDs for both receptors. Genetic based NR4A 1 and 2 loss of function strongly activates anti-cancer
immune responses by reversing T-cell exhaustion which underlies poor ICI responses in GBM. In addition,
NR4A1/2 promote EMT in other cancers which contributes to chemoradiation resistance. Finally, high levels of
NR4A1/2 expression in GBM are strongly associated with decreased patient survival after conventional
treatments. Therefore, we propose to test the hypothesis that CDIM inhibition of NR4A1/2 reprograms the
GBM TME and potentiates ICI and TMZ/XRT responses. Further NR4A1/2 upregulates PD-L1 and TWISt1,
key regulators of GBM immune suppression and mesenchymal phenotypes, respectively. Preliminary studies
demonstrated that CDIMs inhibit PD-L1 and TWIST1 expression, reverse immune suppressive myeloid and T
cell phenotypes and prolong survival of experimental GBMs. We will test our hypothesis by i) identifying lead
dual NR4A1/2 CDIM compounds based on inhibition of malignant and mesenchymal GBM cell properties
(proliferation, self-renewal, invasion) and reversal of dysfunctional T cell phenotypes in vivo (Aim 1), ii)
establishing the functional impact of NR4A1/2 CDIMs to reprogram the immune suppressive and mesenchymal
TME (Aim 2) and iii) quantifying the effects of NR4A1/2 CDIMs to potentiate ICI and SOC responses in mouse
GBM syngeneic models and define the role of PD-L1 and TWIST1 in their mechanisms of action (Aim 3).
Quantification of potency, pharmacokinetics and preclinical anti-tumor activity alone and in combination with to
standard of care TMZ-XRT and ICIs is expected to identify candidate CDIMs for consideration in future clinical
trials. Through application of powerful bioinformatic tools that model the cancer TME through integration of
scRNAseq, cyTOF and IMC data, these studies are expected to shed new light on novel mechanisms by which
mesenchymal and immune suppressive TMEs interact to coordinately drive treatment resistance in GBM through
NR4A1/2. To achieve our goals, we assembled a unique multidisciplinary team with expertise in medicinal
chemistry, neuro-oncology, GBM biology and preclinical modeling, and immuno-oncology."
10745683,"ABSTRACT
 Chronic viral infections represent a major biomedical problem and are characterized by a long-term
equilibrium between the pathogen and the immune system. Such equilibrium is enabled by adaptations of
immune cells that attenuate selected immune functions to minimize immunopathology while keeping the
pathogen in check. Similar immune-adaptations may be detected (often in a transient manner) after acute
infections but are only sustained and relevant for pathogen persistence during chronic infections. Thus,
studying the mechanisms underlying immune cell adaptations in the context of chronic infections may not only
unveil new basic biology of the immune system but could also unlock new therapeutic strategies for alleviating
persistently infected individuals. This is best exemplified by the discovery of T cell exhaustion and their
inhibition via the inhibitory receptor PD1 during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in its
natural murine host, two findings that were extended to many infections in humans as well as cancer and
autoimmune diseases. In addition, we and others have established that Dendritic Cells (DC), which play central
roles in immunity, also adapt in the context of chronic viral infections, showing compromised development from
bone marrow progenitors, suboptimal maturation and altered cytokine production.
 To understand the mechanisms underlying DC and their progenitor adaptations, we applied a cutting-
edge bioinformatic approach to analyze the transcriptome and epigenome of DC progenitors from LCMV
infected mice, and predicted altered activity of several transcription factors (TFs). Among them, we revealed
that Glucocorticoid Modulatory Element Binding Protein 1 (Gmeb1) suppresses DC development and
maturation while Zinc Finger Protein 524 (Zfp524) regulates cytokine production in vitro. These results provide
evidence that Gmeb1 and Zfp524 hold exceptional promise to improve our basic understanding of DC biology.
We propose to take advantage of the well-established and sustained DC adaptations during chronic LCMV
infection to further explore the novel roles and underlying mechanisms of Gmeb1 and Zfp524. For that, in
Aim#1 and #2 we plan to fully establish the roles of Gmeb1 (Aim1) and Zfp524 (Aim 2) in vitro and in vivo, in
both uninfected and LCMV infected mice as well as in human DCs. We will determine their downstream target
genes and investigate how these TFs' roles on DC regulation relates to the known function of Gmeb1 as an
enhancer of glucocorticoid driven gene expression, and to the putative regulation of Zfp524 expression by Aryl-
hydrocarbon receptor. Finally, we will study the relationship of Gmeb1 and Zfp524 DC regulation with the roles
of type-I-interferons and toll-like-receptor-7 that we reported for DC adaptations after chronic LCMV infection.
 Our studies will use cutting-edge technology to unveil the molecular mechanisms by which DCs are
regulated in the context of a chronic viral infection in vivo. This will significantly increase our basic knowledge
of DC biology and unveil new therapeutic targets to harness DCs in infectious and non-infectious diseases."

genetic susceptibility on pediatric health and adverse outcomes, with attention to solution-oriented research.
System enhancements, a secured computing environment, and experience with on-boarding sites will facilitate
an efficient, and effective transition from the first cycle (ECHO1) into the next cycle (ECHO2). DAC’s familiarity
with existing ECHO sites and data enables continued productivity concurrent with implementation of ECHO2.
DAC uniquely offers deep experience in developing innovative methods for analyzing data combined from
disparate sites, as evidenced in ECHO1. DAC will broaden access and useability of ECHO Cohort data to the
scientific community. To help drive the next generation science in pediatric research, expertise in
epidemiology, statistics, informatics, pediatric outcomes, environmental exposures, and genetics is synergized
to realize these specific aims: 1) Provide a secure, uniform and flexible central framework for data capture and
storage and tracking of biospecimens, and to ensure high data quality and fidelity; 2) Provide statistical and
epidemiological expertise in the design, analysis, and interpretation of research proposals, develop innovative
and novel analytical methods where needed, and conduct analyses under direction of relevant content area
scientists to enhance the scientific rigor and reproducibility of ECHO products; 3) Enhance research
infrastructure, integrate data standards to support findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)
principles to accelerate data sharing; 4) Use an organizational, reporting, and accountability structure for
optimal internal governance of the DAC and interaction with other components of the ECHO Cohort Study that
will enhance transparency, accountability, and clear communication. The proposed enhancements, tools, and
methods development for collecting, combining, and analyzing individual, geographic, family, and social data

10908716,"Abstract: Pregnant and postpartum women who are Black and use drugs are fighting to survive at the inter-
section of 3 of the gravest public health crises of the 21st century US: (1) the maternal mortality epidemic; (2)
an evolving overdose epidemic; and (3) intersectional discrimination. In a nation with the highest maternal mor-
tality rate of all high-income countries, US Black women suffer mortality rates threefold higher than White
women. Dire as this inequity is, a recent epidemiologic transformation of the US overdose epidemic is poised
to widen it. While overdose mortality rates were markedly higher among White people for most of the 2000s,
overdoses among Black people have surged recently, and since 2018 Black/White inequities have emerged.
 State legislatures have been actively responding to this crisis: 44 states have enacted >1 law governing
drug use in pregnancy. Some laws are punitive, and seek to deter prenatal drug use through criminal sanctions
(e.g., classifying drug use in pregnancy as child abuse/neglect). Others seek to expand substance use disorder
(SUD) treatment for pregnant women (e.g., require that treatment programs prioritize pregnant women).
 Unfortunately, we know remarkably little about how these ubiquitous laws shape overdose or related health
service use among Black pregnant/postpartum women who use drugs. In part, this silence reflects intersec-
tional discrimination in medicine/public health: the field of maternal health has largely ignored people with be-
havioral health conditions, and harm reduction has neglected pregnant/postpartum women, particularly Black
women. The scant evidence that does exist is, however, alarming. The handful of studies on punitive laws
largely confirm ACOG, CDC, and SAMHSA warnings that these laws undermine Black women’s health and
healthcare use. The few studies of laws seeking to increase SUD treatment opportunities for pregnant women
find that they have no effects or may actually reduce SUD treatment use among Black pregnant women.
 Guided by two Community Accountability Boards, the proposed study applies a mixed-methods sequential
explanatory “QUAN qual” design to inaugurate a line of high-impact research and action into the possible ef-
fects of select laws governing drug use in pregnancy on overdoses, SUD treatment use, and prenatal/ postna-
tal care use among Black pregnant/postpartum women. Aims 1-3 are national in scope, and analyze multiple
administrative databases to trace, for the first time, the pathways through which these 3 laws might shape
Black pregnant/ postpartum women’s overdose risk and health service use. Aim 4 will explain and enrich Aim
1-3 findings through an in-depth qualitative case study of these pathways in one Metro Area (Atlanta). Aim 5
applies evidence-based community organizing methods to support community mobilization in Atlanta around
select intervention targets identified in Aims 1-4. The proposed project will have high impact: it will help Black
pregnant/ postpartum women who use drugs survive the collision of the Black maternal mortality and overdose
epidemics, by either optimizing the benefits of laws governing drug use in pregnancy or mitigating their harms."
10747845,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It is a common occurrence in human that pain is perceived at a remote location away from the diseased
organ. This is also true with bowel dysfunction. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and/or irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) often experience bladder hyperactivity and somatic pain. Understanding the peripheral
mechanisms of pain generation and sensory cross-sensitization helps development of therapeutic approaches
with minimum central adverse effects to treat pain comorbidity. Peripheral glial cells are gaining increased
recognition for their roles in modulating sensory neuron activity. Satellite glial cells (SGCs) of dorsal root
ganglia (DRG) reside around sensory neurons and connect sensory neurons through SGC networks. Using
Cre-based expression of hM3Dq to activate glial cells by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), we show that activation of
glial cells leads to an enhanced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release to the spinal cord, an essential
process in spinal central sensitization. Activation of glial cells also facilitates hypersensitivity of the colon,
urinary bladder and hind paw in mice. In DRG, TrkB.T1 is expressed by SGCs but not neurons. Calcium (Ca2+)
activity is a common pathway mediated by hM3Dq and TrkB.T1 in SGCs. Importantly, using a unique SGC-
sensory neuron co-culture system we show that activation of SGCs mediated by TrkB.T1 leads to activation of
adjacent sensory neurons that participate in pain processing. We therefore hypothesize that TrkB.T1 mediates
glia-neuron interaction and participates in sensory neuron cross-activation and cross-organ sensitization. To
test this hypothesis, we will use mice with inducible conditional TrkB.T1 deletion (TrkB.T1cKO) from peripheral
glia mainly from SGCs and mice with hM3Dq or hM4Di expression in peripheral glia. We will perform molecular
and functional analysis of colon-bladder sensory neuron cross-activation and cross-organ sensitization in these
unique mouse lines (Aim 1). The functional roles of TrkB.T1 in SGCs are to increase the levels of Ca2+ to
promote gliotransmitter release. We have identified a number of glial mediators that are regulated by TrkB.T1
in SGCs through proteomic screening and transcriptional analysis. We will characterize TrkB.T1-mediated
gliotransmission and gliotransmitter-facilitated sensory neuron activation in the context of cross-organ
sensitization (Aim 2). Central sensitization not only contributes to colon-bladder cross-sensitization but also
underlies viscero-somatic cross-sensitization. We therefore will examine whether TrkB.T1-mediated SGC-
sensory neuron crosstalk contributes to CGRP central release and leads to viscero-somatic cross-sensitization
(Aim 3). Throughout the three aims, we will use more than one animal models and apply in vivo and in vitro
approaches for functional and mechanistic studies. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that TrkB.T1 is
sexually dimorphic. We therefore will perform our experiments in both genders. We anticipate revealing the
role of TrkB.T1 in glia-neuron interaction to provide insights in understanding the development of cross-organ

Mutations in various oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes as well as other genome rearrangements
are a principal cause of human cancers. Lung tumors have especially high burdens of mutations.
Despite this dependence of cancer development on multiple genetic events, many human lung
carcinogens are tested as nonmutagenic in standard assays. Our current lack of knowledge about the
causes of genetic damage by seemingly nonmutagenic carcinogens negatively impacts public health
actions and precludes early detection of this class of dangerous chemicals. Metals is one important
group of widespread carcinogens that are largely nonmutagenic, including lung cancer-causing nickel
(Ni). Ni is a large-volume industrial metal with inhalation exposures occurring daily among millions of
workers. This metal is also a common environmental pollutant that is abundantly released during fossil
fuel burning, incineration of municipal waste and many other processes. Ni is found at > 50% of
Superfund toxic sites. In this project, we will test a conceptually novel hypothesis that Ni(II) disrupts a
unique biochemical process and the resulting metabolic dysfunction causes gross genetic alterations
and cancerous transformation of human lung cells. Our main hypothesis will be tested in three
complementary aims. The proposed studies will determine (1) mechanisms of Ni(II)-induced changes
in cell metabolites, (2) initial and secondary genetic abnormalities resulting from Ni(II)-altered
metabolism and protective functions of ATR kinase, and (3) importance of Ni-induced metabolic
dysfunction in tumorigenic cell transformation. The completion of the proposed work is expected to
establish a novel mechanism for indirect genotoxicity by a major human carcinogen. This mechanism
can be applicable to other nonmutagenic carcinogens possessing a specific chemical reactivity. The
project should also provide a valuable mechanistic information needed for modeling of cancer risks at
low-dose Ni exposures and identify targets for development of potential chemopreventive approaches."
10747862,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the primary cause of death and disability in children and young adults1. TBI
afflicts more than two million people annually in the United States, with an estimated 5.3 million TBI survivors
living with lasting neurological impairments2,3. Mild TBI (mTBI) or concussion, accounts for nearly 90% of TBIs,
with symptoms including deficits in learning and memory that profoundly affect the daily life and overall health
of TBI survivors. Although TBI survivors suffer a range of cognitive impairments, deficits in learning and
memory are most common4–6. The hippocampus is critically involved in both of these phenomena and highly
susceptible to damage by TBI. Little is known about the precise mechanisms by which hippocampal damage
produces memory deficits. Our preliminary data indicate that spatial memory (a type of episodic memory
required for the discrimination of a spatially moved object), requires coordinated hippocampal theta and
gamma rhythms in the local field potential and neuronal firing time-locked to those rhythms (Figures 7-9 and
Innovation section below). Both of these required components are critically dependent on the activity of
inhibitory neurons, and specific inhibitory neurons in hippocampal area CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) are
significantly altered after TBI7,8. Based on these results we hypothesize that altered synaptic transmission
in specific hippocampal inhibitory neuron populations alters the balance between excitation and
inhibition (E/I balance), leading to local circuit dysfunction and significant weakening of the
coordinated hippocampal oscillations and neuronal firing required for normal spatial memory. To test
this hypothesis, in vivo and in vitro recordings together with chemogenetic manipulation of specific
subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in area CA1 and DG will be used to determine whether restoring normal
inhibitory neuron function will reinstate normal rhythms, time-locked action potential firing, and normal spatial
memory."
10747865,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) is a highly morbid, life-threatening disease. Despite
declining smoking prevalence, the incidence of SCCOP is increasing, particularly among younger adults. This
trend is the result of the rising prevalence of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the population.
The majority (approximately 70-80%) of SCCOP patients are HPV-positive [HPV(+)]. HPV(+) SCCOP is distinct
from HPV-negative [HPV(-)] SCCOP in terms of epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular features, and especially
in terms of clinical behavior, response to treatment and survival. Therefore, in patients with SCCOP,
determination of HPV status is critical for defining prognosis and tailoring therapy. Unfortunately, there is
currently no effective screening method to identify patients with tumor HPV(+) SCCOP. Further, among patients
with HPV(+) SCCOP, there remains heterogeneity in clinical outcomes. Identification of patients with SCCOP
needing treatment intensification and those able to benefit from reduction of treatment intensity is critical to more
effective and less morbid treatment. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that affect the immuno-inflammatory response
control HPV clearance and escape of immune surveillance, and may contribute to tumor HPV status and related
clinical outcomes of SCCOP patients. NcRNAs exhibit stable expression in human serum. We hypothesize that
pretreatment serum expression profiles of immuno-inflammatory response ncRNAs are associated with tumor
HPV(+) SCCOP and related clinical outcomes. The specific aims for this project are as follows: Aim 1: To
determine if pretreatment serum expression profiles of selected immuno-inflammatory response ncRNAs are
markers of tumor HPV status in a cohort of 1500 patients with incident SCCOP recruited, treated, and followed
at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Aim 2: To determine if pretreatment serum expression
profiles of selected immuno-inflammatory response ncRNAs predict disease-specific survival, disease-free
survival, and overall survival among HPV(+) SCCOP patients from the cohort described for Aim 1. Aim 3: To
validate significant associations found in Aims 1 and 2. We will use an independent cohort of 625 SCCOP cases
to control for potential false-positive or unbiased estimates of associations. Aim 4: To characterize functions of
immuno-inflammatory response ncRNAs on tumor radiosensitivity in vitro. We will screen a panel of HPV(+)
SCCOP cell lines for ncRNAs of interest in a clinical setting, in order to further validate these prognostic ncRNAs
found in Aim 2. This functional study will validate 1 or more of these ncRNAs as biomarkers that can be
incorporated into prognostic prediction models to permit more personalized treatment. Identifying novel
biomarkers for tumor HPV status and prognosis of patients with HPV(+) SCCOP will allow physicians to more
effectively tailor screening for patients at risk of HPV(+) SCCOP, as well as treatment, and surveillance strategies
that optimize survival and quality of life for patients with HPV(+) SCCOP."
10747866,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to develop a novel bimodal intraoral imaging device for assessment of the oral and
oropharynx mucosa for detection of neoplasia, aiding in early detection. Oral and oropharyngeal cancers account
for 640,000 new cases of cancer worldwide each year. The number of cases increases each year, in part due to
the spread of human papillomavirus. The 5-year survival rate has remained relatively unchanged over several
decades, despite accessibility of the oral cavity and oropharynx for examination. With early detection, the 5-year
survival rate increases to 80%, providing hope of improved patient outcomes given development of effective
early detection approaches. The current clinical approach of detection by visual examination with palpation to
guide biopsy acquisition, is insufficient to reliably detect neoplasia at the earliest, most treatable stages, including
oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and early oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our preclinical
and pilot clinical sample studies indicate that label-free nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM), consisting of
multiphoton autofluorescence microscopy and second harmonic generation, is highly promising as an optical
biopsy method. It provides deep mucosal imaging at subcellular resolution and detects parameters associated
with neoplasia that parallel histology. In addition to optical histology, NLOM provides additional spectroscopic
metrics based on the metabolic and biochemical microenvironment, which may add to optical histology metrics.
Our results assessing NLOM for this application show high sensitivity and specificity for detection of neoplasia,
and a high degree of agreement with histopathology. Despite these advantages, a limitation of microscopy is the
inherently limited image field of view on the order of hundreds of microns. On the other hand, clinical large area
screening methods comprised of widefield autofluorescence (WF) imaging provide the fields needed
(centimeters) with high sensitivity for detection, but lack specificity and cannot image below the surface or assess
microscopic features. In this project, we will combine the benefits of both approaches into a single handheld
intraoral imaging device that will provide large area screening for regions of suspicion for neoplasia using WF
coupled with detailed, depth-resolved subsurface imaging by NLOM for highly sensitive and specific detection of
high risk lesions (OED) and early OSCC. To accomplish this goal we will 1) construct a biomodal WF-NLOM
intraoral imaging device and optimize performance and suitability for noninvasive evaluation of neoplasia in
human oral/oropharyngeal mucosa; 2) refine and translate methodology and metrics defined in preclinical
studies, to the intraoral device for use in human OSCC; and 3) evaluate the bimodal intraoral imaging device
performance and conduct a pilot study to evaluate the device in patients in vivo, obtaining valuable feedback
regarding potential for detection of neoplasia and adaptability for the clinic."

 Child obesity disproportionately impacts young Latino children. Obesity interventions focusing on 2- to 5-
year-olds are critical as excessive weight gain during this period increases the risk of adolescent and adult
overweight and has important implications for later health problems. Moreover, many obesogenic behaviors in
adulthood, like television viewing and consumption of sugary drinks, begin at this age. The most effective
childhood obesity interventions are those rooted in behavior and family systems theories. Both of these
theories provide approaches to support lifestyle changes with an understanding that family is the major
mediator of social influences on a child’s development. To date, however, most family-based interventions: (1)
focus on one parent, typically mothers; (2) miss the opportunity to leverage the Latino cultural value of familism
(i.e. family connectedness) to impact childhood obesity outcomes; and (3) include lengthy curricula requiring
weekly in-person sessions over a 2- to 6-month time period. The rationale for the proposed study is to address
these shortcomings by evaluating the effectiveness of a community-based intervention that is shorter and
involves multiple family caregivers. The intervention will include in-person and mobile phone components
focusing on Latino caregivers of young children, to support evidence-based and age appropriate dietary,
media-viewing, and physical activity practices among 2- to 5-year old children, in order to decrease ethnic
disparities in childhood obesity. The study will also explore the intervention’s potential to multiply the public
health benefit by reducing obesity risk for adult caregivers. A prospective randomized study design will be used
to evaluate the effectiveness of the family-based childhood obesity intervention on child BMI at 6- months
(primary outcome) and at 12 months (secondary outcome), compared to a usual WIC care group. The study
will randomize approximately 260 adult Latino caregivers of 2- to 5-year old children (2 caregivers per child)
and half will be assigned to the intervention, and the other half will serve as the control group. All families will
be recruited from four WIC Centers in Los Angeles County. Primary and secondary outcomes will include: (1)
changes in child BMI outcomes at 6- and 12 months; (2) changes in child dietary, media-viewing, and physical
activity practices; (3) whether familism attenuates or amplifies the intervention’s effect on differences in child
BMI change between intervention and WIC usual care group; and (4) changes in caregiver’s dietary, physical
activity, and weight. Pre- and post-intervention anthropometric and survey data will be collected at baseline, 1-,
6-, and 12-months post-baseline to estimate the intervention effect size on child BMI and weight-related
practices, and explore whether familial mechanisms moderate the intervention’s effect on child BMI."

Violence and humanitarian crises are common in the lives of children around the world, particularly in low- and
middle-income countries. Exposure to war-related violence is detrimental to the mental health of parents and
children, but research exploring mechanisms by which emotional and behavioral disruptions are transmitted to
subsequent generations remains nascent, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To help address this gap, a study
of war-affected youth has been underway since 2002 following a cohort of war-affected children—many, both
male and female, former child soldiers—in Sierra Leone into young adulthood, and now parenthood. A prior
NICHD-funded R01 (R01HD073349) demonstrated how childhood war-related trauma and loss contributed to
mental health problems in adulthood. In 2017, a cross-sectional sample of intimate partners and biological
offspring was added to the sample to examine linkages between early trauma exposure and both intimate
partner and parent-child relationships. Knowledge to date of how war-related stressors “get under the skin,” to
become heritable biophysical traits and the implications for the mental health of the next generation remain
limited. Of relevance are the Research Domain Criteria-related constructs of self-regulation and stress
reactivity and how they influence emotional, cognitive and social functioning of children. The proposed
research comprises a significant advance in the 20-year history of this study by advancing understanding of
potential biological embedding of stress responses intergenerationally. Building on four prior waves of data
collection, biological measures of stress reactivity and self-regulation (autonomic nervous system reactivity,
inflammation, telomere length) will be collected in a sample of parents exposed to significant trauma in
childhood and extended also to intimate partners and offspring. Strong capacity-building collaborations with
Sierra Leone’s University of Makeni (UNIMAK) and Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) will support the
ethical collection of new stress biomarker data and clinical assessments of parent-child synchrony, health, and
anthropometric data in biological offspring aged 7–24. Key study innovations are (a) rare prospective data on
parental trauma exposure and longitudinal information on risk and protective factors operating across the
social ecology; (b) data on biological embedding of stress responses related to parental trauma; and (c) the
opportunity to examine both mental health and physiological outcomes in biological offspring in war-affected
families over time. Advanced statistical techniques (e.g., latent class growth models, structural equation
models, lagged effects models) will articulate mechanistic pathways and priority targets for intervention.
Collaborations between investigators, UNIMAK, KGH, as well as community advisory boards will inform study
implementation, ensure strong retention of participants, and provide channels for dissemination. Analyses will
inform screening tools to identify families for preventive interventions. Intervention targets identified have
implications not just for war-affected settings, but also for assisting diverse populations affected by violence
and trauma, including migrants and refugees."

Egg generation entails a unique cell division, Meiosis I (a process also known as oocyte maturation), during which the oocyte acquires its developmental competence. For poorly understood reasons, mammalian oocytes (including human, bovine and porcine oocytes) are notoriously prone to reduced quality. Because oocyte quality is a major determinant of embryo developmental competence and pregnancy success, the long-term research goal of this application is to dissect basic molecular mechanisms that regulate meiosis I in human, bovine and porcine oocytes to understand why female gametes are notoriously prone to reduced quality. Work from our group has demonstrated that preferential initial nucleus and spindle positioning at the center of mouse oocytes is an insurance mechanism to avoid the premature exposure of the spindle to the cortical signaling that hinders proper chromosome-microtubule attachments, thereby protecting against aneuploidy, the major genetic cause
of infertility and congenital defects. These findings implicate initial peripheral nucleus and spindle positioning as a major risk factor for aneuploidy in mice. Strikingly, in contrast to mouse oocytes, the majority of human, bovine and porcine oocytes have a peripheral nucleus and, subsequently, peripheral spindle formation. Interestingly, in
human oocytes, peripheral nucleus positioning correlates with poor maturation rates. How the nucleus/spindle behaves when it is initially positioned peripherally in those species (humans, pigs and cattle) and whether this behavior correlates with aneuploidy are unknown.

This proposal builds on these findings via two complementary albeit independent aims: (1) determine the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating nucleus behavior in human, bovine and porcine oocytes, and (2) determine whether nucleus/spindle positioning relates to aneuploidy. To carry out these aims, we will employ super-resolution microscopy, multiphoton laser ablation, genetic, optochemical and integrative multiomic approaches. These conceptually and technically innovative aims are expected to have a broad impact on the field by filling a substantial gap in our knowledge of how the nucleus/spindle behaves in human, bovine and porcine oocytes to ensure the development of good-quality gametes with clear clinical implications for assisted reproductive technologies. Such understanding is relevant to human and animal reproductive health because mammalian oocytes are notoriously associated with poor developmental competence and aneuploidy, major causes of early pregnancy loss (a high priority area of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of the NICHD)."
10760829,"Of the more than 300,000 service personnel that have sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to recent
conflicts, 70-80% are treated with opioids for post-injury symptoms. TBI-injured Veterans clinically managed for
these symptoms that include chronic pain, are more likely to receive opioid-based treatment and engage in
higher-risk opioid use. This increase in prescription opioid use among Veterans with TBI reflects the nationwide
opioid abuse and dependence crisis and highlights the need to develop non-opioid based treatment for chronic
symptom management. Recent data indicate early activation of oxidative stress mediators and long-term
response of pro-inflammatory factors are common to both opioid action and TBI and that targeting of these
mechanisms, particularly during the sustained inflammatory response, would be an effective approach to
mitigate opioid addiction vulnerability in TBI-affected Veterans. An emerging and promising approach is use of
photobiomodulation (PBM), a low level light therapy known to attenuate both oxidative stress and inflammatory
signaling in clinical and experimental applications. While successful in reversing TBI-induced cognitive deficits,
PBM will be used in the current proposal as a novel means of addressing exacerbated opioid seeking that
occurs after injury. Our preliminary data support use of PBM to mitigate TBI-induced elevations in reactive
oxygen species, inflammatory markers and morphine seeking, which we also demonstrate to be attenuated
following pharmacological treatment with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs. The central hypothesis is
that TBI will enhance chronic morphine seeking through exacerbated recruitment of oxidative and
proinflammatory systems in regions responsible for these behaviors, and that these will be reversed by
neurotherapeutic intervention with PBM. This hypothesis will be tested with two Specific Aims: (1) Quantify the
effect PBM on TBI-induced oxidative and inflammatory markers in reward- and pain-related regions [and
blood] in the chronic post-injury period, [(2) Quantify the effect of PBM, and adjunctive exposure to antioxidant
or anti-inflammatory compounds, on morphine-seeking behavior.] This work would establish that PBM therapy
attenuates injury-induced oxidative and inflammatory outcomes that may drive aberrant pain and opioid
seeking in the chronic post-injury period. Identification of non-invasive alternatives to opioid-based strategies
for chronic symptom relief would provide an improved strategic framework to assist Veterans in the post-TBI
rehabilitative period."

 The development of effective drug use interventions for sexual minority men (SMM) in relationships is a
public health priority. SMM – particularly those under age 35 – continue to represent the majority of new HIV
infections in the US and 35-68% of these infections are transmitted between main or primary relationship
partners. Drug use is a well-established correlate of sexual HIV transmission risk behavior (TRB) for SMM
generally and associations between drug use and HIV TRB are comparable for single and partnered SMM.
 Despite success with individuals and groups, applications of MI with couples are rare and initially
produced mixed results. Developed for use with individuals, MI provided relatively little guidance to counselors
when partners were not equally ready to change or one partner argued against a health behavior. Dr. Starks
(PI) has devoted more than a decade of research to the development of a novel framework for conducting MI
with a couple. Our paradigm views the couple (rather than one partner in the relationship) as the client and
offers strategies for managing conflict and promoting the development of shared goals and change plans.
 Our team, which includes experts in behavioral intervention development and HIV prevention with
SMM, now proposes an efficacy trial of the Couples Health Project (CHP). CHP is the first multi-session
couples MI drug use and HIV risk reduction intervention intended for use by counselors and other mental
health professionals who deliver evidence-based substance use treatment to SMM. The project builds directly
on the intervention development work and pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) results of DA043422 (PI-
Starks). Results indicated that CHP was associated with significant reductions in drug use and sexual risk
taking among couples who were at the highest risk.
 We now propose a multi-site trial powered to test the efficacy of CHP and evaluate putative moderators
(and mediators) identified in our pilot work. Participants include 180 male couples in which at least one partner
is age 18 – 34; HIV negative; and reports recent (past 30 day) drug use and sexual HIV TRB. Biological
markers for drug use (urine assay) as well as bacterial sexually transmitted infections corroborate self-reported
drug use and HIV TRB data. To increase generalizability and feasibility, couples will be recruited online across
the US. Following completion of a remote baseline assessment by both partners, the couple is randomized to
either the CHP intervention or a single session of couples HIV testing and counseling (the standard of care for
male couples’ sexual health) delivered in a telehealth format via HIPAA complaint ZOOM by interventionists
based at geographically diverse medical and research facilities (New York City; Detroit, MI; and Charlottesville,
VA). SMM complete follow-up assessments (remotely) 3, 6, and 9-months post-intervention."

Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a devastating disease with aggressive growth and frequent metastases.
Less than 30% of patients with metastatic TNBC survive beyond five years after their diagnosis. While other
breast cancer subtypes have well-defined endocrine markers, TNBC tumors lack such specific therapeutic
targets, making cyclic chemotherapy the mainstay of treatment. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy aims to
leverage TNBC’s inherent yet limited immunogenicity, though success has been restricted by other
immunosuppressive elements in the tumor environment. The overarching goal is to find alternative and/or
synergistic methods to enhance immune-mediated cytotoxicity in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. The overall
objective of this proposal is to enhance tumor microenvironment immunogenicity by repolarizing macrophages
out of a pro-tumor state and into a cytotoxic, anti-tumor state. The central hypothesis is that mitochondrial fusion
governs tumor associated macrophages’ (TAM) pro-tumor functions within the tumor microenvironment. The
rationale for this project is that macrophage metabolism defines polarization fate. Particularly, anti-tumor
macrophages upregulate glycolysis while pro-tumor macrophages depend on oxidative phosphorylation. As
mitochondria house oxidative phosphorylation-associated pathways, and as mitochondrial structure impacts
oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, manipulating mitochondrial structure could determine polarization fate. This
proposal consists of proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate macrophages are flexible and that repolarization
can be achieved by manipulating mitochondrial structure in vitro and in vivo. Along this trajectory, the central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of mitochondrial dynamics
in macrophage polarization. For this aim, we will culture TNBC tumor macrophages in vitro, manipulate
mitochondrial dynamics, and then evaluate polarization. Aim 2 will determine whether TAM pro-tumor functions
within the tumor microenvironment are dependent on mitochondrial fusion. In this aim, we will evaluate the effect
of macrophages with altered mitochondrial dynamics on T cell cytotoxicity, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The
proposed studies are innovative because they will evaluate direct causation between mitochondrial dynamics
and macrophage polarization and will also define a relevant in vivo macrophage phenotype. The project is
significant because it sets the foundation for manipulation of macrophage mitochondria as a therapeutic strategy
to enhance tumor microenvironment immunogenicity for TNBC. Collectively, these studies will lend insight into
the mechanisms that govern macrophage fate and make progress towards novel immune therapies for TNBC."
10758197,"In recent years, evidence has been accumulating for the serious detrimental impact of childhood trauma
exposure on child and adult physical and mental health. This evidence is mostly based on retrospective studies
of traumatized adults. Prospective longitudinal studies in children are necessary to determine the impacts of
trauma on neurobiological development. Furthermore, effects of trauma are not static, and may oscillate based
on environmental factors affecting neurobiology of traumatic stress. Examining the longitudinal course in
trauma-related symptoms in children will help in identification of biological and environmental factors
contributing to vulnerability and resilience. While parental and environmental factors have an impact on stress
in traumatized populations, the biological mechanisms of this transmission are not yet clear. Exploring these
factors is vital in determination of the most important modifiable factors affecting childhood mental health
following trauma exposure in order to inform future interventions.
We will leverage an existing cohort of Syrian and Iraqi refugee children ages 7-17 and their parents who settled
in the United States starting in 2016. We will explore longitudinal changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression,
and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) post war-zone trauma in Syria, as well as resettlement, and their
epigenetic, autonomic, and environmental correlates. We have already established the impact of exposure to
war trauma and stress of migration in this cohort and their parents within one month of their arrival in the
United States. This initial assessment (Wave 1) showed high rates of anxiety in the children, and high rates of
PTSD and anxiety in their parents. We propose to follow this cohort (Wave 2, 12-24 months, and Wave 3, 24-
36 months), with collection of self-report measures of anxiety, depression and PTSD, saliva DNA samples, and
skin conductance response as peripheral marker of sympathetic arousal. [We will also do a cross sectional
comparison of above symptoms and biomarkers with Arab immigrant children without war trauma exposure].
This proposal represents the first study to examine course of illness, epigenetic, autonomic, and environmental
correlates of stress and trauma among Syrian refugee children and their parents. A strength of the study is
the known developmental timing of trauma exposure and availability of assessments immediately upon
arrival, as well as the ability to follow-up the children longitudinally during development. The possibility
of finding potential unique epigenetic changes, as well as most important environmental and parenting risk
factors, promises to advance efforts to improve child outcomes and reduce risk for later mental and physical
health problems associated with childhood trauma and stress. This knowledge will not only be useful in
providing better health services to this specific population in need, but also in increasing our more general
understanding of trauma and environmental impact on child development and psychopathology."

This isolation of exceptionally broad anti-HIV antibodies has revealed sites of vulnerability
on the virus’s surface protein, Env. Major efforts are now underway to elicit such antibodies
with vaccines, or to use the antibodies directly as therapeutics. The design of such vaccines
and therapies requires carefully characterizing how monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal
sera recognize Env. We have recently developed a new deep-sequencing based approach to
functionally characterize antibody-Env interactions on a large scale. Here we will greatly
extend the utility of this approach by making it possible to easily and completely map the
effects of all amino-acid mutations on viral recognition by both neutralizing and non-
neutralizing antibodies or sera. Specifically, we will:
 1) Create libraries of viruses carrying all single amino-acid mutations to Env, as well as
 many combinations of mutations. These libraries will be designed in a way that
 enables them to be easily and cheaply characterized by deep sequencing.
 2) Develop methods to use the libraries to efficiently map how mutations to Env affect
 virus recognition by neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies and sera.
 3) Create algorithms and software to analyze and visualize the “Big Data” sets
 generated by the mappings.
We will use these tools to completely map how Env mutations affect recognition by
important monoclonal antibodies, as well as natural and vaccine-induced plasma responses.
We will also distribute the experimental and computational tools so that they can be easily
used by the entire HIV research community. Overall, this work will develop powerful
methods to functionally map the antigenic effects of mutations to HIV. Such maps will aid in
the basic study of HIV and inform the design of vaccines and therapeutics."
10757424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We found that neurons secrete a soluble protein that protects neurons under cell stress conditions in a
paracrine manner. Remarkably, this protein is derived from the C-terminus of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane bound transcription factor CREB3L2. Proteolytic cleavage liberates the N-terminal transcription
factor and leads to the secretion of the ER luminal domain into the extracellular space. Our preliminary data
indicate that the production and secretion of this C-terminal domain is triggered by cell stress and that it acts
by increasing mitochondrial function via sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. In this project we are testing the
general hypothesis that CREB3L2-C is a paracrine component of the adaptive neuronal stress response.
We will culture primary rat cortical neurons and expose them to various cell stress triggers, including oxidative
stress, ER stress, proteasome inhibition, and glucose-deprivation. We will determine whether the activation of
the integrated stress response pathway is necessary and sufficient to upregulate the synthesis and cleavage
of CREB3L2. We will investigate how the luminal C-terminal domain of CREB3L2 is secreted from cells and
whether its secretory pathway is linked to cell stress. To investigate how the secreted C-terminal domain of
CREB3L2 affects neurons, we will purify it and apply it to primary cortical neurons. We will focus on its
proposed role in strengthening Shh signaling and determine whether it forms complexes with Shh and its
receptor Patched-1 on neurons. We will determine whether application of the secreted, C-terminal domain of
CREB3L2 is sufficient to increase Shh signaling and whether enhanced Shh signaling is necessary for its
effects on cell survival and mitochondrial function. To assess the effect of the secreted C-terminal domain of
CREB3L2 on mitochondria, we will employ a variety of tests to quantify changes to mitochondrial mass,
abundance of mitochondrial proteins, and mitochondrial function in neurons under normal conditions and
upon induction of oxidative stress, ER stress, proteasome inhibition, and glucose-deprivation. The cleavage
of CREB3L2 activates necessarily two distinct signaling molecules, the intracellular transcription factor and
the secreted C-terminus. We will use chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing in combination with
RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptional targets of CREB3L2 in neurons under baseline and induced
stress conditions, to determine whether both signaling molecule act cooperatively in the adaptive cell stress
response. Lastly, we will use a previously generated conditional CREB3L2 knockout mouse to study the
relative roles of the cell autonomous (i.e. the transcription factor) and the non-cell autonomous arm of
CREB3L2 signaling in neuronal stress response in vitro and in vivo. Together, the results from this project will

10927454,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is highly prevalent in older (≥50 years) people with HIV (PWH). Older PWH have
higher rates of NCI than the general population of the same age; prevalence rates are as high as 50% – even
among the virologically controlled. Having NCI is associated with increased mortality, decline in independence,
lower medication adherence, poor decision making, and possibly greater dementia risk. The pathogenesis of NCI
in HIV is likely multifactorial due to extensive diversity of PWH and factors that affect the brain (e.g., HIV,
demographic, socioeconomic, chronic inflammation, comorbidities, and psychosocial stress). This knowledge,
however, comes mostly from high-income countries (HICs). Yet, the burden of HIV is greatest in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs) where our understanding of NCI (e.g., prevalence; risk; patient/provider needs) in aging
PWH is only just emerging and risk may differ than in HICs. Multimodal phenotypes of NCI risk can help elucidate
NCI’s mechanisms and assist in developing more targeted interventions for it. Critical aspects of HIV disease differ
between HICs and LMICs (e.g., immune responses, age of patients, duration of HIV infection, type of treatment,
and socio-economic factors), but most phenotyping studies have been done with PWH in HICs. We propose to
leverage multimodal data (e.g., demographic, medical, inflammation) from a cohort of diverse, aging, and treated
PWH in Malaysia from two time points across 4-6 years and add one more time point to develop longitudinal
phenotypes of NCI risk – a first for PWH in Malaysia. A pre-requisite, however, is high quality, accurate, unbiased,
and valid neurocognitive test data that can be easily collected in any setting and is suitable for cross-study/-country
comparisons and Big Data applications. Because few tests meeting these requirements exist in Malaysia, we
propose to adapt and preliminarily norm a battery of tests (NeuroScreen) that do. NeuroScreen is brief (~25
minutes), highly automated, easy-to-administer by all levels of staff, disseminated via the internet, designed for
adaptation across countries/languages and in harmonized cross-study data sets. It assesses six neurocognitive
domains most affected by HIV, and has a growing body of evidence demonstrating that it is unbiased, culturally
fair, and psychometrically valid in adolescent and adult populations with HIV and varying levels of computer
literacy in multiple countries and languages (US, South Africa, and neighboring Thailand). No testing apps have
been adapted and normed for ethnically diverse Malaysians, where the most commonly spoken languages are
Bahasa Malaysia, Mandarin, Tamil, and English. Using NeuroScreen’s data will enhance our phenotyping.
Moreover, having an easy-to-use and valid tool to measure neurocognition and screen for NCI can enhance
research and clinical care for PWH in Malaysia. We will build neuropsychological expertise in Malaysia (where
there is little); promote multidisciplinary research into the causes, risks, and detection of NCI in HIV; and expand
capacity to use state-of-the-art statistical analyses (i.e., machine learning)."

Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor in children and
demonstrates high level of heterogeneity. Treatment for MB includes chemotherapy and
radiation often resulting in long-term morbidity. MYC driven MB in particular are high risk
tumors with poor long-term survival. We previously identified WEE1 as a target in MYC driven
MB. WEE1 regulates MYC driven replication stress and high throughput chemical screening
identified high degree of synergy with gemcitabine. Further data suggest that MB tumors
become resistant to WEE 1 inhibition and that this mechanism is mediated by CDK7.. We
hypothesize CDK7 re-sensitizes MB cells to WEE1 inhibition by reprograming
the enhancer landscape to alter metabolic pathways and suppressing homologous
recombination DNA repair networks. To CDK7

CDK7 inhibition therapeutically effective in MB in vivo? 3. Can addition of agents that target
recombination mediated DNA repair potentiate CDK7/WEE1 mediated therapeutic
of MB? The results of this work are expected to yield important insights into
that could be used to inhibit MYC function in high-risk MB, and provide a rationale

10763384,"Project Summary/Abstract
Native, Black, and Latinx people are disproportionately killed during police encounters
and these murders are rarely prosecuted. Much of the social justice-driven research on
police violence has focused on legal and political interventions that govern law
enforcement practices. This project takes a different approach by examining the science
of the autopsy, the American medical examiner/coroner system, and the nation’s long
legacy of policing and state-sanctioned violence against communities of color. The
medical examiner/coroner system in the United States plays an integral, but often
overlooked, role in determining whether police are held accountable for deaths that
occur under their custody. However, medical examiner/coroner reports rarely establish
police culpability even when evidence indicates otherwise. This project undertakes
archival research informed by media and federal government data on nationwide death
under police custody to recover and document the history of three medical
examiner/coroner offices that have played pivotal roles during the periods of English
settler colonialism, the westward expansion of American empire, and racial segregation
following the Great Migration of Black communities to Northern cities. To this end, the
project will request and analyze images, documents, microfilm, and other materials from
the medical examiner office in Jamestown, Virginia, the country’s first medical examiner
office founded during the era of colonial settlement. This project will also study the Los
Angeles Medical Examiner Office founded after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)
in the city that is the current incarceration center of the world. Finally, we will study the
history of the Wayne County Medical Examiner in Detroit, Michigan which is the nation’s
most racially segregated city now undergoing rapid gentrification. Through these efforts,
the project seeks to produce a peer-reviewed book monograph, a series of articles for
public audiences, and the development of policy recommendations for reforming the
medical examiner/coroner system. This project intends to offer new insights about the
history of the U.S. medical examiner system and the politics of autopsy science that will
inform the work of public health officials, community activists, lawmakers, and academic
scholars working on tracking mortality from legal intervention and creating social justice
reforms within policing, law enforcement, and incarceration."
10763437,"Project Summary
 The current pandemic has highlighted fundamental gaps in our knowledge about the replication strategies
of coronaviruses, and how these are affected by the host at both the organismal and cellular level. There is a
pressing need to understand how SARS-CoV-2 infection and host-cell responses trigger such a diverse set of
pathologies, and the roles played by viral variation, host genetics and underlying preconditions. As studies of
SARS-CoV-2 frequently utilize population-based assays that look hours to days post infection, information on
cellular and spatial variability are lost. Furthermore, host responses are communicative spatial processes subject
to signaling gradients that vary between cells. Thus, averages over populations obscure heterogeneity and
spatial separations, and miss the earliest viral and host behaviors due to lack of sensitivity.
 To fill this gap, we developed experimental and computational approaches to quantify individual virion
entrance, establishment of the first replicative events, and production of viral RNAs and host responses in single
cells, all while maintaining sample spatial integrity. This project’s long-term objective is to apply this novel
approach to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology distinct from those gleaned using traditional strategies. This
knowledge will provide new insight into the spectrum of COVID-19 disease outcomes and help guide future
therapeutic strategies.
 To this end, single-molecule in situ analyses, including single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization
(smFISH) and multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) will be applied to the study of SARS-CoV-2. Aim 1 will
quantify SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication and spread, and host transcriptional responses in cells of varying tissue
origin. These data will be used to develop a stochastic computational model to address the determinants of early
viral replication and the resulting cellular response. Aim 2 will examine the effect of host mutations or pre-existing
conditions that affect the type I interferon (IFN) response and have been associated with severe COVID-19, as
well as emerging viral Variants of Concern. Aim 3 will model patient comorbidities in vivo using mouse models
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying the functional and spatial consequences of host responses, including IFN
and other cytokine expression, in the respiratory tract and lung. We will further utilize these in vivo models to
understand why pathogenesis and disease outcome differ depending on the inoculum dose and the age of the
animal. Together, our multidisciplinary approach utilizing techniques and information from systems-level virology,
spatial transcriptomics, host genetics, computational biology, and innate immunity provides a powerful means of
probing questions central to understanding clinical outcome and informing life-saving interventions."
10763721,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) afflicts 1 to 2 million Americans, and an estimated 50-60% of these patients
develop lupus nephritis (LN) during the first 10 years of disease. The management of LN is still challenging,
despite the development of numerous new classes of immune therapeutics. Intrarenal inflammation is a defining
feature for LN, relying mainly on the homing of immune cells to the kidney. Therefore, a key unmet need is
mechanistic studies that examine specific pathways that govern the homing of immune cells to the kidney. High
endothelial venules (HEVs) are specialized veins responsible for the homing of T cells to lymph nodes, and
earlier studies from others and us have demonstrated that lymphotoxin (LT) signaling is required for the
homeostatic maintenance of functional HEVs. Here, our new data, for the first time, reveal the presence of
intrarenal HEVs in the glomeruli and the interstitium in both mouse and human LN kidneys Our overall
hypothesis is that the stimulation of LTR+ intrarenal stromal cells by LTa+ Th17 cells drive the formation of
intrarenal HEVs, leading to the homing of pro-inflammatory immune cells to the kidney and progression of LN. A
series of well-designed experiments will be performed with the novel tools and advanced technology platforms
developed in our listed cores to examine the functional role of the interaction between LTR in kidney stromal
cells and LTα in Th17 cells in forming HEVs, recruiting inflammatory cells, and advancing LN. We will determine
disease outcome in LN after disruption of the interaction between LTα on TH17 cells and LTR on kidney stromal
cells (Aim 1 and 2). Aim 3 focuses on our innovative approach to target HEVs for the delivery of first-in-class
nano-immune therapeutics (such as anti-CD3 and anti-IL23). These therapeutics will be encapsulated in a
polymeric nanoparticle, the surface of which will be coated with MECA-79 mAb, which recognizes HEVs. Our
corollary hypothesis is that targeted delivery of immune therapeutics to the kidney should markedly increase
their efficacy at lower required dosages, thereby improving their safety profile. This project will elucidate the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying LN development, and these new findings will provide important
mechanistic insight into the development of effective targeted therapies in patients with LN."

Tamara Isakova, MD, MMSc is applying for the K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented
Research (POR). She is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at the Northwestern
University Feinberg School of Medicine. She directs the Center for Translational Metabolism and Health within
the Institute for Public Health and Medicine and the Clinical and Translational Core of the O'Brien Kidney Core
Research Center. Dr. Isakova's research is focused on developing the evidence for novel approaches to
improve cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). She has expertise in
epidemiologic studies, POR and multi-center clinical trials, and she has served as a scientific mentor for
medical students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty. Support from the K24 will provide Dr. Isakova with
protected time 1) to devote more time to mentoring a diverse group of young investigators in POR; 2) to
improve her POR mentoring skills through mentor training and guidance from senior mentors; 3) to expand into
new scientific areas through cross-disciplinary collaborations; 4) to replenish support for her research program
through new NIH funding; and 5) to increase involvement in clinical trials, which will allow her to assume
leadership in collaborative POR. A large body of evidence implicates disordered mineral metabolism as a
mechanistic contributor to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in CKD. The current proposal builds
upon this scientific premise and extends the R01-supported work of the PI. Project 1 leverages ongoing work
in the CKD Optimal Management with BInders and NicotinamidE (COMBINE) trial, which is a multi-center,
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that tested the hypothesis that nicotinamide (blocks active
phosphate transport in the gut) and lanthanum carbonate (phosphate binder) would safely lower serum
phosphate and fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) levels compared to placebo over 12 months in 205 patients
with CKD stages 3b–4. With support from the K24, the PI will ascertain whether the efficacy of lanthanum
carbonate was more pronounced in certain subgroups, determine the relationship of phosphate and FGF23
lowering with myocardial strain, and investigate the effects of interventions on downstream products of
nicotinamide and other metabolites and on T50, a calcification biomarker. Project 2 leverages ongoing work in
the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an observational study of ~4,000 patients with
CKD stages 2 – 4. With support from the K24, the PI will determine whether a combined assessment of T50
and other intermediate cardiovascular disease end-points could help identify a CKD-specific cardiovascular
disease phenotype, and she will examine possible modifiable determinants of deoxycholic acid, a secondary
bile acid implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification in CKD. Conduct of the proposed Aims will
advance the field of non-traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, suggest potential therapeutic
approaches that the PI will test in future interventional studies and will provide a fertile ground for POR training."
10763859,"TITLE: Development and Evaluation of a Clinical Assessment Tool of TBI-Related Social Communication
Adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at risk for communication impairments that negatively affect return
to work, family, and community roles. TBI-related social communication impairments (TBI-SCI) are
characterized by ineffective, disorganized, and inappropriate verbal communication and reduced capacity to
understand others’ non-literal and non-verbal messages. Despite the importance of social communication to
daily life, TBI-SCI are under-diagnosed and under-treated because speech-language pathologists (SLPs) lack
clinical assessment tools that are quick, reliable, valid, and inform person-centered treatment planning. The
objective of the proposed K23 career development award is to address this gap by developing, refining, and
evaluating patient- and caregiver-reported TBI-SCI assessment tools that meet the needs of SLPs and adults
with TBI. Patient-reported outcome measures facilitate personalized rehabilitation and rigorously assess
health-related outcomes and treatment effects. Guided by person-centered rehabilitation theory and existing
assessment tools, we will conduct a prospective qualitative study to identify social communication skills and
mediating factors that stakeholders (adults with TBI, family members, and SLPs) perceive as important to TBI-
SCI rehabilitation. Findings will inform the content and structure of parallel patient- and caregiver-reported
clinical assessment tools. We will refine the tools using iterative cognitive interviewing to ensure the tools
capture the most important factors to TBI-SCI rehabilitation (i.e., are content valid) and are easy to
comprehend. Preliminary psychometric testing will be conducted on tool responses from a diverse sample of
100 adults with TBI and 150 caregivers to evaluate tool validity and reliability. This work supports NIDCD’s
strategic priority to develop and test improved diagnostic tools that will provide communication treatment
targets and will inform a subsequent R01 application to conduct large-scale psychometric testing and to test
the feasibility of clinical implementation. Completion of the proposed research and career development
activities will equip Dr. Byom with in-depth knowledge and comprehensive training in clinical assessment tool
development, including qualitative research methodology, quantitative tool evaluation, and principles of
implementation science. With this training, Dr. Byom will be uniquely poised to translate her training in social
communication theory, TBI-SCI, and clinical TBI communication rehabilitation to development and evaluation
of clinically feasible SLP practices to support adults with TBI."
10763870,"Project Summary
The auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus, IC) is a hub and a major subcortical integration center in the central
auditory pathway. Neurons in the IC are tuned to specific spectro-temporal features and are involved in the
processing of communication sounds and speech. Abnormal sound-evoked or spontaneous IC activity has
been associated with numerous central hearing dysfunctions including impaired speech perception,
hyperacusis, and tinnitus. The spectro-temporal tuning of IC neurons arises from the integration of a multitude
of ascending and descending inputs and an elaborated network of excitatory and inhibitory intrinsic synaptic
connections between IC neurons. While the function and organization of external inputs to the IC are becoming
increasingly understood, current understanding of the organization, physiology, and development of synaptic
connections intrinsic to the IC is limited, hampering insight into their potential roles in IC function. To fill this
knowledge gap, we propose to address three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that the central
nucleus of the IC (CNIC) contains two separate, functionally distinct, local networks arising from disc-shaped
and stellate cells. We further hypothesize that the differentiation of these networks occurs after hearing onset
requires normal patterns or levels of sound-evoked activity. To address these hypotheses, we will use laser
scanning photostimulation with caged glutamate to map the location of neurons in the CNIC that
monosynaptically connect to identified CNIC neurons in slices from control mice and from mice that were
reared in pulsed white noise or have experienced temporary conductive hearing loss. In Aim 2 we will test the
hypothesis that the physiological properties of synaptic connections are distinct between the two intrinsic CNIC
networks and that their maturation depends on normal auditory experience. We will address this using
simultaneous whole-cell recordings from identified neurons in slices from control mice and mice with a history
of abnormal auditory experience. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that abnormal sound-evoked single unit
responses in the CNIC of mice with a history of abnormal auditory experience reflect abnormal intrinsic
connections. We will address this by characterizing spectro-temporal responses properties of optogenetically
identified glutamatergic and GABAergic CNIC neurons in awake control mice and mice with a history of
abnormal auditory experience and correlate the changes observed in in-vivo with changes in intrinsic networks
characterized in-vitro. Results from the proposed project will provided novel insight into the organization,
synaptic physiology, and development of intrinsic CNIC circuits and their possible role in impaired sound
processing in the CNIC. This new information will be valuable for understanding the circuit changes in the
CNIC that contribute to the generation of central hearing deficits that are commonly observed in children that
suffered from conductive hearing loss."
10932235,"Project Summary. Obesity is widespread in the United States and is a risk factor for chronic illness, impaired
quality of life, and mortality. Like many health outcomes in the US, its prevalence and treatment are
characterized by stark racial disparities. Black patients experience obesity at significantly higher rates than
White patients and are less likely to benefit from leading obesity treatments. While these disparities are most
plausibly attributed to social, economic, and environmental inequalities, the misguided suggestion that they
might instead reflect genetic differences between members of different racial groups has been made
repeatedly. This has occurred in the context of trends in which the conceptualization of obesity as a biomedical
disease with a genetic etiology has been increasingly ascendant in recent years. The proposed research will
examine the extent to which primary care providers endorse genetic explanations for racial disparities in
obesity and whether such beliefs might be related to a dearth of knowledge about genetics (Aim 1). It will also
test whether primary care physicians are more likely to attribute obesity to genetic causes when it occurs in a
Black (vs. White) patient, and whether such racially disparate endorsement of genetic attributions might lead to
differences in attitudes toward patients and in clinical judgments regarding patient care (Aim 2). In addition, the
research will examine how American adults with obesity react to genetic explanations for obesity in healthcare,
and whether such reactions differ between Black and White individuals (Aim 3). This will be accomplished
through an experiment testing how Black and White Americans with obesity respond to a description of a
physician who does (vs. does not) endorse genetic explanations (Aim 3a), as well as through focus groups in
which Black and White adults with obesity will discuss their views about the use of genetics in obesity-related
healthcare (Aim 3b). This research will shed light on ethically significant questions related to how beliefs about
the role of genetics in obesity may shape clinical care for obesity and physician-patient relationships in racially
disparate ways, potentially contributing to racial health disparities. It will inform future efforts to determine how
the genetics of obesity can be taught to clinicians and discussed with patients in culturally sensitive ways, to
avoid fueling problematic attitudes and beliefs about racial disparities or harming the important relationship
between patients and their healthcare providers."
10764234,"ABSTRACT (Project 2: Xinxin Ding and Qing-Yu Zhang) 
Environmental exposure to arsenic metalloids, the major toxic contaminants in mine tailings, is associated with 
increased incidence of metabolic diseases in humans, posing a significant health risk to people living near 
contaminated sites. Populations residing near mining sites may be exposed to mine tailings through the 
inhalation of dust particles or ingestion of contaminated water or food, as the arsenic contaminants may become 
bio-accessible and cause debilitating metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The diabetogenic potential of 
arsenicals in environmentally-occurring mine tailing particulates is unclear, however, and the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the diabetogenic effects of arsenic are not fully understood - knowledge gaps that have 
markedly hindered disease prevention efforts. Nrf2, a master regulator of the antioxidant response, enhances 
cellular protective mechanisms through the canonic pathway, leading to activation of many antioxidant and 
biotransformation genes. Evidence also suggests, however, that Nrf2 may disrupt cellular homeostasis upon 
prolonged activation via a noncanonical pathway activated by the dysregulation of p62-dependent autophagy. 
The current study will test the novel hypothesis that Nrf2-stimulated protective mechanisms play an important 
role in limiting the adverse impact of chronic arsenic exposure through the modulation of host metabolic 
homeostasis and gut microbial arsenic biotransformation. Accordingly, we believe that the disruptive events 
(studied in Project 1) and the protective mechanisms (Project 2) mediated by Nrf2 signalling are both important 
determinants of the diabetogenic risk of mine tailing arsenic metalloids. Nrf2 target genes include those for 
enzymes involved in the production or metabolism of bilirubin, including heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) and CYP2A 
(mouse Cyp2a5 and human CYP2A6). Strong clinical and experimental evidence indicates the protective role of 
bilirubin against the development of metabolic syndromes. Although transient, Hmox1 was drastically induced in 
the intestine, but not in the liver, upon arsenic exposure in drinking water (25 ppm) (preliminary data). Cyp2a5 
was among the most highly and persistently induced genes in the mouse liver following chronic oral exposure to 
arsenic (preliminary data). These findings support the specific hypothesis that the induction of intestinal Hmox1 
and hepatic CYP2A5/6 serves as an important counterbalance against the diabetogenic effects caused by 
chronic Nrf2 activation by mine tailing arsenic metalloids. The hypothesis will be tested through three specific 
aims. The outcome is expected to contribute to an integrated mechanistic view of the risk factors underlying 
arsenic’s diabetogenic effects, and thus fill an important knowledge gap that has hampered disease prevention 
efforts."

Legacy mine tailings that remain after extraction of economic metals are frequently enriched with co-occurring 
contaminants such as arsenic (As) that pose serious health hazards to neighboring communities and 
ecosystems. As-ingestion has been associated with diabetes, numerous cancers, and cardiovascular 
disorders. The mode of action for As toxicity is not clear; however, the degree of toxicity is associated with the 
valence and the methylation state of As metabolites (e.g. trivalent As species, iAsIII, MMAIII, and DMAIII ,are two 
times more cytotoxic than iAsV; methylated pentavalent arsenicals are 10-fold less cytotoxic than AsV). The gut 
microbiome is a primary point of contact for As in the host because oral ingestion is the principal exposure 
route. In addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated the capacity of human colon microbiota to biotransform 
iAs to both more and less toxic forms. Thus, accurate As risk assessment requires understanding of 
presystemic contributions by the gut microbiome to the bioaccessibility and speciation of the host As-load. The 
overall objectives of this proposal are to 1) contextualize the composition of the mouse gut 
microbiome with its functional capacity to metabolize As and to 2) evaluate the capacity of defined As- 
transforming microbial communities to affect in vivo diabetic outcomes following As exposure. The 
multidisciplinary team will employ a unique approach to identify specific associations between the composition 
of the gut microbiome, its genetic and functional capacity to sequester and/or transform As, and its capacity to 
either exacerbate or mitigate host diabetic outcomes in response to As exposure. Routine microbial taxonomic 
(16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling) and functional gene (shotgun metagenome) analyses will identify the 
impact of host sex, age and As-exposure on mouse fecal community composition. This molecular analysis will 
be combined with function-based high throughput culture analysis of the same fecal communities to facilitate 
the design of 120 distinct synthetic microbial communities (SynComs). The functional capacities of each 
SynCom to transform/sequester iAs will be identified and will potentially capture emergent properties of 
microbially-mediated As biotransformation that might be missed in studies using isolated phylotypes. The 
SynComs will be clustered in functional guilds with differing capacities to increase or decrease the As-load 
experienced by the host. These SynComs will be tested in germ-free mice to evaluate the capacity of specific 
microbial consortia with distinct As biotransformation capacities to modulate diabetic outcomes of As exposure. 
It is hypothesized that microbial communities that reduce As toxicity and associated diabetic outcomes can be 
exploited as potential probiotics. This hypothesis will be tested through verification of the ability of positive- 
outcome SynComs to colonize a specific pathogen free (SPF) mouse host and prevent or reduce pro-diabetic 
effects of iAsIII exposure."
10764238,"ABSTRACT (Project 4: Jon Chorover and Mark Brusseau)
Legacy mine tailings are a primary source of arsenic and toxic metal exposure to proximal communities
throughout the semi-arid Southwest. Because they are geochemically unstable under Earth surface conditions,
tailings begin to undergo weathering transformations that lead to changes in the molecular form or “speciation”
of toxic metal(loid)s immediately upon their deposition. Weathering reactions, which are driven by meteoric
inputs of water and gases, are manifest as a “reaction front”, or a transition zone from highly-weathered to
unweathered tailings with increasing depth below the surface. The rate of the reaction front propagation and
the types of reaction products formed depend on climate and tailings mineral composition. The weathering-
induced transformations of arsenic, lead, and zinc alter their bioavailability, yielding particles that can be more
or less toxic than the primary tailings particles when ingested or inhaled. Although climate and tailings lithology
control the weathering rate, the weathering process itself occurs at the grain scale, where fluid filled pores,
sometimes in close proximity to each other, may exhibit sharp gradients in chemical composition and
concentration. The transport and reactions that occur at this pore- to core-scale must be understood
mechanistically to better predict the diagenetic alteration of tailings and contaminant bioavailability as a
function of climate, and to enhance our capacity for accurate risk assessments and effective remedial
approaches. We will evaluate the weathering processes underway at 10 federal Superfund Sites spanning a
wide range in climate, where human health risk is primarily associated with elevated arsenic concentrations in
sulfide-ore derived tailings media. Cores will be collected from each of the sites as a function of depth and
transported to the laboratory for detailed characterization of physical, mineralogical, microbial, and
geochemical composition. Depth-dependent weathering trends and reaction fronts will be determined. These
bulk reaction fronts and transformations will be correlated with alterations in arsenic, lead, and zinc molecular
speciation and bioaccessibility. A subset of the extracted cores, representing distinct pathways of metal(loid)
transformation, will be utilized in instrumented column experiments conducted in the laboratory under
controlled conditions. Columns will be subjected to detailed studies of the evolution over the course of the
experiment of pore-structure, metal(loid) speciation, and associated bioaccessibility. These experiments, which
will comprise solution samplers as a function of length along the column, will enable the collection of a reactive
transport dataset to identify the biogeochemical reactions controlling metal(loid) transformation under different
conditions. The data generated will be used to implement a reactive transport and fate model of tailings
diagenesis that will serve as a predictive tool for assessment of health risk associated with tailings deposition
under differing climatic scenarios."

Soil contamination with trace elements in the vicinity of mining sites and smelters poses a serious threat to
humans and the environment around the globe. Revegetation of mine tailings to minimize the dispersal of
pollutants via wind or ground water (i.e. phytoremediation) is a promising “green” and low-cost intervention
to toxic exposures. Unfortunately, plant growth is inhibited on most tailings, making it necessary to provide
additional healthy substrate for seed germination and seedling growth. The current practice is the installation
of an uncontaminated soil-gravel-rock cap over the tailings prior to plant seeding, with stockpiles of such
material being readily available, a technology known as “cap and plant”. However, critical knowledge gaps
regarding plant-soil interactions have prevented a broad and efficient implementation of this technology. The
primary objective of this project is to identify the optimal strategy for generating a lasting vegetation cover at
hazardous mining sites. The guiding hypothesis is that the biophysicochemical properties of capping material
are critical for the development of robust root systems that can propagate into the underlying contaminated
mine tailings. Using an innovative experimental design, this project will develop specific soil health indices
and assess the effects of capping material depth and quality on root system architecture in a prospective
plant species known as saltbush (Atriplex lentiformis) for phytoremediation. Various capping materials from
stockpiled overburden and adjacent natural deposits will be tested in three consecutive greenhouse studies
that bring together advanced ecological, genomic, and soil health assessments. Specifically, root system
development will be monitored using a noninvasive phenotyping method based on rhizotrons, filled with
different combinations of capping material and mine tailings from Superfund sites across the US Southwest.
Once the optimal soil and plant parameters are identified, possibilities to amend existing but low-quality
capping material in a cost-effective way will be explored. This project will yield an unprecedented mechanistic
understanding of concurrent changes in plant root system architecture and function in response to the quality
and depth of capping materials used for mine tailing restoration. Capitalizing on this knowledge, specific
guidelines towards the remediation of hazardous sites will be developed and directly transferred to the mining
industry and regulators. As such, the project outcome will be valuable for the economy and society. In
addition, our findings will serve as a global template for mitigating human and environmental health issues in
areas affected by mines and smelters."
10769257,"Project Summary
Replication stress (RS) is defined as the slowing or stalling of the replication fork progression during DNA
synthesis and is widely recognized as a significant cause of genomic instability and a critical feature of cancer
cells. The response to RS is facilitated by ATR kinase which induces a cascade of molecular events to facilitate
cell cycle arrest, stabilization of the replication forks and DNA repair. Inhibition of ATR may be an effective
strategy against tumors with high degree of RS. However, thus far, clinical evaluation of ATR inhibitors (ATRi)
has demonstrated limited efficacy as monotherapy outside the setting of BRCA deficient and ATM deficient
tumors. Using two high-throughput approaches, i.e., PRISM screening of ~800 genomically characterized
human cancer cell-line models and genome-wide CRISPR-based functional screen of ATRi elimusertib, we
found that inhibition of the PI3K pathway may synergize with ATRi. Preliminarily, we have also demonstrated
synergism between PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and ATRi elimusertib in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, this synergism
is particularly relevant to uterine cancer (UC) because of the prevalence of genomic alterations associated with
high RS in uterine serous tumors (e.g. CCNE1 amplification, MYC amplification, FBXW7 mutations) and because
UC (predominantly those with endometrioid or clear cell histology) frequently harbor ARID1A mutations which
have been shown to be associated with cell cycle progression defects in both S and G2/M phases of the cell
cycle leading to increased RS and sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Additionally, although all histologic subtypes of
UC are characterized by PI3K pathway alterations, response to PI3K inhibition as monotherapy has been
disappointingly low and no PI3K inhibitor is currently approved in UC. For all these reasons, we hypothesize that
combined ATR and PI3K pathway inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy to capitalize on concomitant
PI3K pathway alterations and high degree of RS in uterine serous and ARID1A-mutated uterine tumors. In Aim
1, we will perform in vitro studies of targeted inhibition of ATR alone and in combination with PI3K inhibition
across a collection of established patient-derived organoids with various genomic backgrounds to assess for
synergism and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will evaluate in vivo synergism between ATRi
elimusertib and PI3Ki copanlisib in PDX and GEMM models of UC and will explore whether this correlates with
IHC assays of replication stress. Finally, in Aim 3, we will conduct a Phase 1b dose escalation trial of PI3K
inhibitor copanlisib and ATR inhibitor elimusertib in UC with two dose expansion cohorts in uterine serous (cohort
A) and ARID1A mutated uterine tumors (cohort B). It is our expectation that the research proposed herein, if
successful, will provide patients with recurrent UC with a new therapeutic option that is applicable across different
histologic subtypes of UC for which no specific therapies exist. Furthermore, if successful, the therapeutic
strategy of exploiting RS and PI3K pathway alterations using combined ATR/PI3K blockade would be readily
applicable to alternative tumor types such as breast, ovarian and prostate cancers as well as cancers with
ARID1A deficiency whose therapy remains a significant unmet medical need."

Microsatellite stable (MSS)/mismatch repair proficient (MMRP) uterine cancers (UCs) represent approximately
two thirds (66%) of all UCs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The combination of pembrolizumab with
lenvatinib is currently the only FDA approved treatment for recurrent MSS/MMRP UCs, but adverse effects are
a major challenge in the clinic and a large population of patients do not respond to this regimen. There are
currently no FDA approved and no effective salvage therapies for patients with recurrent MSS/MMRP UC who
do not tolerate, do not respond or progress through pembrolizumab/lenvatinib. Notably, MSS/MMRP UCs are
characterized by genomic alterations associated with high degree of replication stress (RS); therefore, use of
DNA damage checkpoint kinase inhibitors such as WEE1 or ATR inhibitor can be therapeutically exploited to
induce tumor-selective synthetic lethality and modulate anti-tumor immunity, representing an appealing strategy
against these tumors. Furthermore, in our preliminary work, we have demonstrated that targeting the RS with
ATR or WEE1 in UCs leads to activation of the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that DNA
damage checkpoint kinase inhibitors will increase RS-associated DNA damage to engage DNA sensing STING
pathway activation to prime the immunologically “cold” MSS/MMRP UCs into “hot” tumors; combined DNA
damage targeting agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can overcome tumor-associated
immunosuppression and lead to effective antitumor activity against MSS/MMRP UCs. We propose to test an
entirely novel strategy to extend the benefit of immunotherapy in MSS/MMRP UC by using DNA damage
checkpoint kinase inhibitors in combination with ICIs in both human and murine models of UC. In Aim 1, we
propose to characterize the immune effects of ATR and WEE1 inhibitors on human UC cell lines, patient-derived
organoid models and tumor specimens from the clinical trials of adavosertib and BAY1895344/copanlisib from
Projects 1 and 2 respectively. In Aim 2, we will assess the contribution of RS-targeting potentiated DNA sensing
STING pathway activation to the immune effect and therapeutic efficacy of WEE1 or ATR inhibition in vivo in
syngeneic models of UC, and in Aim 3, we will evaluate the anti-tumor immunity and therapeutic efficacy of
WEE1i or ATRi in combination with ICI in vivo in syngeneic models of UC. The overarching goal of this project
is to provide the mechanistic insights and important information to support initiation of clinical trials of effective
combinations DNA damage checkpoint inhibitors with ICI in patients with MSS/MMRP UC."

Obstetric fistula is a traumatic maternal morbidity resulting in severe urinary incontinence that increases stigma
and reduces quality of life. The two million women with fistula, most in sub-Saharan Africa, face substantial multi-
level barriers to surgical repair. Women need an acceptable non-surgical option for therapeutic
management of fistula-related urinary incontinence, yet no non-surgical standard of care exists. Use of
an insertable silicone vaginal cup has great potential for fistula management; it is effective for menstrual
management and efficacious at reducing short-term fistula urinary leakage. We propose a clinical trial and nested
qualitative study to 1) quantify the effectiveness of an insertable vaginal cup to manage fistula urinary
incontinence, 2) examine user and implementer acceptability, and 3) quantify fistula management cost.
Two intervention models will be compared among women awaiting fistula surgery or whose surgery was
unsuccessful: 1) a vaginal cup (‘cup’), and 2) the cup attached via rubber tubing to a leg-secured urine collection
bag (‘cup+’) for greater urine holding capacity. Using a cross-over design for efficiency, 100 participants will be
randomized to one of two sequences of leaking freely, cup, and cup+ at two fistula care centers in Ghana and
observed for four days (total observations=400). Each treatment (cup, cup+ or leaking freely) is used for 24h for
day and night use, then crossover. Data are captured through self-report and clinical checklist. On day 4,
participants are re-randomized to use cup or cup+ at home for 3 months. Acceptability assessment is informed
by implementation and health behavior theory. Aim 1. To quantify the effectiveness and comparative
effectiveness of the cup and cup+. The trial will compare objective and patient-reported measures of
effectiveness of the cup and cup+ to leaking freely and of the cup to the cup+. Short-term assessment will be
objective (urinary leakage; 8, 24hrs), long-term assessment will be patient-reported (QoL; 1-3 months). Aim 2.
To examine acceptability of cup and cup+. User and implementer acceptability will be assessed using a
sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. Acceptability among trial participants will be measured
longitudinally (1-3 months). User and implementer acceptability will be examined within in-depth interviews of
selected trial participants (n~30) at 3 months and potential implementers (ob/gyns, midwives/nurses, community
health workers, n~20). Aim 3. To explore the material and opportunity costs to non-surgical fistula
management. Surveys and time motion study among trial participants at facility and community will estimate
direct and indirect costs of fistula management from a patient perspective. The long-term goal of the proposed
work is to overcome barriers to comprehensive fistula care and increase quality of life through an acceptable,
non-surgical option for therapeutic management of fistula."

This is the second renewal on a line of inquiry characterizing the neural basis of the maturation of reward and
motivation through the adolescent period, a time of critical vulnerability to the emergence of major psychopathol-
ogy (e.g., substance use disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorders), which are typically impacted by deficiencies
in these systems. Building on the findings from the first two grants using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography, and reward learning assessments, indicating heightened influence of
reward/motivation (i.e., dopaminergic) systems in adolescence, we now propose to study their wider effects on
establishing adult trajectories by characterizing developmental changes in habit formation and relatedly, stabili-
zation of neural activity. The neural mechanisms that underlie maturation to established neurocognitive behav-
iors have not been studied in human development and can provide unique insights into how adult trajectories
are formed. The central hypothesis is that neurobehavioral processes underlying stabilization of behavior
from adolescence to adulthood are supported by frontolimbic specialization and stabilization of neural
activity. We will study 192 typically developing 10-26 year-olds with habit tasks in fMRI and EEG, and 45
pediatric epilepsy patients with intracerebral EEG. In Aim 1, we will characterize the neurodevelopment of habit
formation as a probe for how modes of stable behavior are acquired defining adulthood, which rodent models
have found is limited in adolescence and has not been studied in humans. We will use a well-established habit
task and determine developmental changes in behavior and BOLD fMRI activity. In Aim2, we will characterize
how changes in frontostriatal systems including using non-invasive indirect measures of dopamine through brain
tissue iron, which in the previous grant we found is closely associated with dopamine, and functional connectivity,
which our previous grant found specializes through adolescence, underlie neurocognitive stabilization into adult-
hood. Finally, in order to understand how neural systems are stabilizing through adolescence into adult- hood, in
Aim 3, we will characterize developmental changes in oscillations and in the variability of neural activity in key
regions involved in habit formation using electroencephalography (EEG) and intracerebral stereo-eletroenceph-
alography (sEEG). sEEG will be performed in collaboration with our co-investigator, a pediatric neurosurgeon
who implants electrodes in preparation for resection due to epilepsy, providing critical data for characterizing de-
velopmental changes in neural activity directly. These studies have never been performed in human development
and can provide novel evidence regarding the neural mechanisms underlying normative establishment of adult
trajectories informing how these may lead to maladaptive trajectories such as in psychopathology, which emerges
during the transition from adolescence to adulthood."

Similar to other indigenous people, Native Hawaiian (NH) view health and well-being holistically.
These concepts are centered on lōkahi (balance) among relationships with family and
community, akua (spiritual), and ʻāina (land, sea). NH communities were once thriving,
sustainable ecosystems. However, westernization of local economies, displacement of people
from their ʻāina, and the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy brought about rapid
changes. Today, historical trauma persists as intergenerational cycles of disparities. The health
of NH youth has worsened. Eurocentric approaches to address health disparities have done
little to interrupt these cycles, especially in under-resourced communities.
The project will address historical trauma and barriers to effective care by moving beyond clinic
walls to create a system of support that embraces NH cultural values and practices, empowers
youth, and promotes lōkahi, resilience, health, and a stronger community. Two well-established
NH-serving federally-qualified community health centers will partner with schools and place-
based community organizations. Together they will increase access to care by identifying and
cross-referring challenged youth for wellness promotion and targeted care/management across
organizations, especially for mental health concerns. Partners will apply NH values, promote
traditional NH concepts in the context of modern methods, and use trauma-informed
approaches. Partners will also collaborate around community-identified outcomes of value
through data sharing and dissemination of results to community members, funders, and
policymakers. This important project will expand knowledge about strategies needed to
implement and sustain a NH youth-centered system of care and the value of such a system to
support youth through young adulthood."
10778579,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In response to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong Subregion,
the World Health Organization is working with local partners to completely eliminate malaria from this geographic
region by 2030. Elimination efforts in the region have led to drastic reductions in the number of malaria cases
and deaths. However, elimination will become increasingly difficult to achieve as the species composition shifts
from P. falciparum to P. vivax (the more difficult species to eliminate), and the malaria burden becomes more
concentrated in border areas, where frequent movement of human populations and mosquito vectors across
borders and the difficulties of conducting surveillance and allocating resources between different countries make
elimination challenging. Local information about factors driving malaria risk will be important for prioritizing
resources and optimizing strategies for malaria elimination, particularly in border areas. Estimates of parasite
migration are important in stratifying malaria risk. Population genomics approaches are beginning to be used to
understand connectivity between parasite populations; however, many of these studies have focused primarily
on regional geographic scales and/or have only used geospatial data to make post hoc geographic
interpretations. Here, we propose an approach that explicitly models the spatial structure in genomic data to
understand parasite migration patterns in an area of emerging drug resistance along the northern border of
Cambodia with Thailand. The work will be accomplished in two aims. First, we will estimate the local population
structure and migration of P. falciparum and P. vivax in an area of dense sampling on either side of the northern
border of Cambodia with Thailand. To achieve this aim, we will generate whole-genome sequence data for P.
falciparum and P. vivax and utilize estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) based on rare variation and
identity-by-descent to infer connectivity of P. falciparum and P. vivax populations between different study sites.
Second, we will estimate local human travel patterns and their association with the parasite migration contours
from Aim 1. To achieve this aim, we will develop a model of local travel networks that is spatially and temporally
explicit at the village level and that accounts for key geospatial features in the region that impact human
movement and effective migration. The association between estimated local human travel patterns and parasite
migration patterns will be assessed and will facilitate identification of segments of the travel network that coincide
with regions of high parasite migration that can be used to define geographical units for targeting elimination
interventions. If successful, the proposed research will illuminate the contribution of movement by local
population groups to spatial patterns of parasite migration and will provide a framework to identify specific
geographic areas for targeted intervention, which can be adapted to other malaria-endemic areas with
intermediate levels of transmission."

Dr. Hsue is one of the few cardiologists in the world with both extensive research and clinical expertise in HIV
and has devoted the last 15 years studying cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of HIV. The initial part
of her career was spent 1) establishing a HIV Cardiology Clinic at Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG),
2) developing the infrastructure to perform patient oriented research in Cardiology including development of a
vascular laboratory for clinical research, 3) performing studies that evaluate the mechanisms underlying HIV
infection and CVD and 4); leading clinical trials aimed to reducing inflammation and CVD risk in HIV. The
findings from her work have shown that 1) HIV infection is independently associated with CVD, independent of
traditional risk factors or ART and 2) chronic inflammation in the setting of effectively treated HIV infection
underlies this increased CV risk. Initial K24 support has led to a significant increase in the number of mentees,
grants, and publications for Dr. Hsue and new research directions including use of novel imaging to assess
HIV disease burden and identification of therapies to reduce HIV-associated inflammation and CV risk. For the
K24 renewal period, her career goals are to perform cutting edge clinical/translational studies and mentoring
that will lead to improvements in treating, identifying and preventing CVD among PLWH and also impact other
comorbidities and HIV cure. Dr. Hsue plans to 1) expand her research to include the role of somatic mutations
in the hematopoietic system (termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, CHIP) and proteomics in
HIV-associated CVD; 2) continue her time spent mentoring junior investigators in the fields of HIV infection,
inflammation, and CVD with a focus on transition to full-independence; 3) obtain leadership training to build
clinical and translational research programs that can be used by mentees and will make her a better mentor.
The majority of Dr. Hsue's career development will occur at UCSF which offers outstanding resources for
clinical/translational research, basic science, imaging, HIV, and mentoring/leadership training. Her K24
proposal will extend upon her current NIH-funded investigations by studying the underlying mechanism of HIV-
associated atherosclerosis in treated HIV with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1A: To determine if clonal
hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations are more prevalent in peripheral blood cells of
PLWH vs. uninfected controls; Aim 1B: To determine whether the presence of CHIP mutations are associated
with increased arterial inflammation and metabolic activity of the hematopoietic system as assessed by FDG-
PET/CT; Aim 2A: To identify a unique proteomic signature in PLWH that is associated with arterial
inflammation and metabolic activity of the hematopoietic system, and Aim 2B: to characterize changes in
proteins and biological pathways that are altered after anti-inflammatory and lipid interventions. This proposal
will provide subject visits, imaging, and clinical and laboratory data to support new investigators in clinical/
translational research in the field of HIV-related CVD and HIV disease pathogenesis including cure."

Some exposures in ophthalmology may not have an immediate effect, but instead a lag is necessary. For
example, there is a literature on possible cataractogenic effects of corticosteroid eyedrops (CS) among uveitis
patients. However, the precise impact of dose and/or duration of use are unknown. Also, the lag between CS
administration and development of cataract is unknown. Another possible application is to study the effects of
dietary and/or supplement use on development of AMD, where a lag effect is also likely to occur. The goal of
specific aim 1 is to use latency analysis methods for ophthalmological endpoints. Latency methods have been
used in pharmacoepidemiology, but to our knowledge, have never been used for ophthalmologic endpoints.
The AREDS study was a landmark study in the epidemiology of AMD. A byproduct of this study was the
development of the AREDS severity scale which is an ordinal scale ranging from 1 for no AMD to 9+ for
advanced AMD (AAMD). The usual analysis for risk factors is a time-to-event analysis based on the Cox
Proportional Hazards Model, where the event is reaching grade 9+. This is a valid, but inefficient analysis.
There are many eyes (about 40%) which show changes (either an increase or decrease), but which don't
develop AAMD. There are risk factors which are associated with these changes, but all such changes are
treated as censored data and are considered “non-events”. In Aim 2, we propose to use an ordinal regression
model for changes between successive visits which would provide a more efficient use of the data. There have
been previous multi-state ordinal models proposed, but separate models are fit for each possible transition and
are not integrated into an overall assessment of risk for specific covariates. This has application not only for
AMD, but also for other ordinal scales used for other ophthalmologic conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy.
For Aim 3, we propose to continue our work on applying correlated data methods to risk prediction for
endpoints such as AUC. We will specifically compare methods for estimating AUC for small samples, extensive
numbers of tied prediction scores and presence of both bilateral and unilateral subjects. In addition, we will
incorporate clustered data methods for estimation of NRI, which to our knowledge, has never been done
before.
In Aim 4, we will continue our work on translation of clustered data methods for the eye research community
including (a) correlated data methods in survival analysis, (b) analysis of longitudinal binary ocular data, and
(c) sample size/power calculations based on the eye as the unit of analysis."

Pragmatic clinical trials aim to test interventions within typical healthcare settings to produce generalizable
results. Successfully implementing pragmatic trials requires overcoming a number of challenges, including
acquiring data as efficiently and non-intrusively as possible, so as to encourage maximum study participation
at lowest cost. Administrative data are a potential solution for some pragmatic trials. These data derive from
routine activities in the healthcare system, including clinical care (e.g., billing systems; use of electronic health
records). With administrative data, participants can be passively followed over long time periods, potentially
with decreased participant burden, decreased loss to follow-up from inability to contact a participant and
decreased cost compared to alternatives (e.g., participant interview or review of medical records). All of these
features could enhance both internal and external validity and reduce the overall cost of a trial. Limited
empirical work exists on the comparative value of various data sources for ascertaining outcomes in pragmatic
trials. We are in a unique position to the leverage the Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop Confidence in
Elders (STRIDE) trial, a ten-site pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial focused on serious fall injury in community-
dwelling older adults, to determine whether outcome ascertainment in pragmatic clinical trials could be
simplified through automated data collection, without introducing significant imprecision or bias, thus reducing
costs. STRIDE has multiple sources of data including multiple reference standards (adjudicated outcomes;
self-reported outcomes) and two administrative data sources (fee-for-service Medicare data; administrative
data from clinical trial sites). We will be able to couple currently available administrative data with newly
available Medicare Advantage data to have a complete administrative picture of this almost universally
Medicare eligible population. Complete data will give us the opportunity to achieve the overall goal of this
research proposal, which is to develop a framework for determining whether administrative data can be used in
pragmatic clinical trials in a Medicare eligible population to efficiently and accurately ascertain the primary
outcome. To achieve this goal, our project has three aims: (1) develop and validate algorithms for detecting
serious fall injuries from administrative data against the reference standards of STRIDE events; (2) determine
the impact of the algorithms on trial findings; and (3) assess the cost efficiency (savings) of conducting the trial
using administrative data."
10878940,"Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) represents the most common form of cancer in the human
body and causes twice as many fatalities each year as melanoma. The method for diagnosing and
treating NMSCs requires a skin biopsy that is processed and stained for analysis on a standard
optical microscope. This process is painful for patients, and the invasiveness of biopsy
introduces a delay into NMSC detection, which contributes to patient morbidity and adds
substantial cost to the healthcare system. Enspectra Health’s mission is to bring digital oncology
diagnostics to the point-of-care for earlier cancer detection where the healthcare cost and
burden to patients is minimal. Cancer is an inherently cellular disfunction, and yet modern
medicine still lacks the basic ability to view cellular histology without biopsy. This widespread
clinical need is the core motivation for Enspectra and its innovations. Enspectra aims to address
this unmet clinical need for a better method to detect NMSCs earlier. This direct to Phase II
application builds on the progress of awarded Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIB projects
(R43CA221591, R44CA221591). In these projects, Enspectra has progressed from concept,
through technical feasibility, and into clinical trials, recently completing enrollment in a pivotal
trial for submission to the FDA for 510(k) approval (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05619471).
Enspectra has created the first portable, fiber coupled, combined multiphoton microscopy
(MPM) and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) system for in vivo imaging of NMSC. In this
direct to Phase II proposal, Enspectra aims to leverage the analytic power of its multimodal data
and extend its reach to Actinic Keratosis (AK), a precancerous lesion that can progress to NMSC.
Enspectra will build a large-scale digital database of histopathology in AKs on patients before
topical therapy. AKs that do not respond to therapy are more likely to progress to NMSC and are
clinically of higher risk. Using the therapy outcome as an indicator of AK severity, Enspectra will
train a deep learning algorithm to predict which AKs would be unresponsive solely on pathologic
features in our noninvasive images. The ability to identify problematic AKs before they become
malignant should improve surveillance of high-risk patients, hasten detection of NMSC, and
lessen the burden of surgical intervention to low-risk patients."

a key component of the postsynaptic density is necessary for retrograde homeostatic signaling.
Next, we will define the induction mechanisms mediating the chronic expression of PHP and

Hypothesis: Type 2 innate immunity protects the gut from C. difficile infection (CDI) via the coordinated
actions of innate lymphoid cell type 2 (ILC2), eosinophils and alternatively-activated macrophages (AAM).
Progress: The first 5 years of support from 5R01AI124214 demonstrated that microbiota-elicited type 2
immunity protects from CDI. It does so at two stages, protecting the epithelial barrier during acute CDI, and
promoting healing. We discovered that key steps in this process are: (i) IL-25 and IL-33 production by the
intestine in response to commensal microbes; (ii) IL-25 and IL-33 activation of ILC2; and (iii) protection by
downstream type 2 cellular effectors eosinophils and AAM. The key knowledge gap is how ILC2, eosinophils
and AAM act to protect.
Significance: C. difficile is a CDC “Urgent Antibiotic Resistance Threat” as the number one hospital-acquired
infection in North America. Current therapy with antibiotics is inadequate, as relapse occurs in up to 20% and
death in 6%. The proposed studies, by identifying how innate immunity protects, offer the promise of
immunotherapy as an addition to current approaches to treatment and as a replacement for fecal transplant.
Investigators: The PI William Petri discovered the role of type 2 immunity in CDI in the prior 5 year period of
support. Key personnel include Maureen Carey (systems biology), Stacey Burgess (spectral flow cytometry),
Katia Sol-Church (scRNAseq) and Jennie Ma and Pankag Kumar (bioinformatics).
Innovative aspects are foremost the hypothesis that type 2 innate immunity protects from C. difficile and that
the immune system can be harnessed to treat CDI.
Approach: We will describe during the course of CDI the individual and collective mechanisms by which ILC2
(Aim 1), eosinophils (Aim 2) and AAM (Aim 3) respond to CDI in the murine model. We will identify common
underlying mechanisms of protection by the coordinated action of these 3 cell effectors of type 2 innate
immunity. The studies will include single cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) in the presence or absence of
protective upstream activation by the intestinal epithelial cytokines IL-25 and IL-33, and interventional studies
to directly test the contributions of innate immune effector cells on protection.
The environment for the work is highly interactive with all of the key personnel located within a few minutes
walk of Dr. Petri’s C. difficile research lab.
Successful completion of these studies will identify the mechanisms by which cellular type 2 responses
protect from CDI and lay the foundation for immunotherapy for CDI as an adjunct to antibiotics and as a
replacement for fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)."
10895527,"Abstract: Organ preservation remains a daunting challenge. Organ specific ischemia windows of 4-24h greatly
limit the field of organ transplantation to save lives and cause severe geographic restriction in the US and
globally. However, by halting ischemic damage at the point of procurement, we could facilitate enhanced graft
viability and thus faster patient recovery, drastically shorter hospital stays, and greatly diminished healthcare
costs – all while tackling the biggest challenge of all – to increase the amount of available organs for transplant.
The goal of this Direct-to-PhaseII SBIR proposal is to establish the pre-clinical use of XT-ViVo for the non-
frozen, subzero ischemic preservation and transplantation of renal allografts leading to improved outcome in
comparison to static cold storage and to render greatly extended CIT of up to 120h possible using practical
storage and transport methods. Reducing damage during extended ischemia is of critical relevance to kidney
transplantation. Indeed, the FDA has recognized this technology as a Breakthrough Device for up to 120h
preservation of the kidney, which could lead to dynamic shifts to logistics of kidney transplantation.
This project combines novel chemistry and expertise in tissue and organ preservation with world leaders in
transplantation. We will apply novel cryoprotectants to high subzero temperature ischemic preservation of
porcine kidneys followed by subsequent transplantation in an effort to significantly extend the ischemia window
of human-sized organs in a clinically relevant model. The evaluation of innovative modalities that may transform
current preservation strategies requires the use of translational animal models for reliable assessment of tissue
viability and functional recovery post-preservation. Herein, we propose two primary aims of the proposed work.
Advanced cryoprotectants will be synthesized and prepared into formulations as organ preservation solutions.
The novel cryoprotectants will first be applied to the preservation of pig kidneys ex vivo, at subzero temperature.
We will assess kidney survival, function, injury biomarkers, histology, and immunohistochemistry. This work will
further asses the ability to greatly extend subzero ischemia time of the kidney up to 120h first ex vivo, and then
using a widely-accepted preclinical large animal transplantation model for close clinical relevance to humans.
Heterotopic kidney transplantation will be investigated after greatly extended ischemic storage on SLA-defined
miniature swine. Animal survival and kidney function will be assessed similarly with a heightened level of detail
at post-operative day 0, 1, 7, and 30 to assess both intermediate and long-term kidney function.
Execution of the stated aims could result in a fundamental improvement in the field of organ transplantation and
will aid acquisition of the final data set required prior to clearance and clinical for commercialization. The product
will offer extension of the ischemia window, simplified use with minimal disruption of current practice, and strong
cost competitiveness compared to the advanced organ perfusion systems being developed in the market today."

The risk of developing prediabetes and diabetes mellitus is higher among persons living with HIV (PLHIV). It
has been estimated that about 50% of prevalent cases of diabetes mellitus, and an even higher level for
prediabetes, remain undiagnosed particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Empirical evidence
suggests that over-reliance on glucose measures may be partly responsible for the poor diagnosis. The World
Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation of Diabetes (IDF) have included the glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) test in their recommendations for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus. The
HbA1c test is considered highly valuable for early detection of diabetes and is becoming widely adopted in
clinical practice including in LMICs. However, the HbA1c test is currently not recommended for use among
PLHIV due to unreliable results attributable to the lower hemoglobin levels in this population. The major goal of
the proposed study is to identify appropriate HbA1c diagnostic thresholds for strata of hemoglobin levels and
markers of inflammation, insulin resistance and immuno-virologic status. Fructosamine, an alternative glycated
test, which has no hemoglobin limitation, will also be evaluated. This will be accomplished through the
following specific aims: Aim 1: Utilize hemogram and other biomarker stratifications to determine optimal
HbA1c diagnostic thresholds for diabetes mellitus and prediabetes among persons living with and without HIV.
Aim 2: Determine optimal fructosamine diagnostic thresholds for diabetes mellitus and prediabetes among
persons living with and without HIV. Aim 3: Examine the diagnostic accuracy of combining HbA1c with
fructosamine tests for the assessment of dysglycemia and develop an algorithm to guide testing based on
biomarker levels. A multidisciplinary team of researchers has been assembled for this project, comprising
internationally recognized experts in HIV, non-communicable diseases, diabetology/endocrinology, clinical
chemistry, and infectious disease epidemiology from the University of Maryland, Institute of Human Virology
Nigeria (IHVN) and local researchers from affiliate academic and clinical centers. We are employing a cross-
sectional design to recruit 992 PLHIV along with age- and sex-matched 770 persons without HIV at the
University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, a collaborating partner of IHVN. A comprehensive questionnaire with
relevant components of the WHO stepwise approach instrument (STEPS) will be administered. Blood samples
will be collected for HbA1c and fructosamine tests along with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and relevant
biomarkers (hemoglobin, serum proteins, c-reactive protein, insulin, CD4 count, HIV RNA). Results of HbA1c,
fructosamine and OGTT, with the latter as gold standard, will be used to generate receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves to determine optimal cut-offs based on biomarker strata. This project will result in a
robust testing regime, using HbA1c and/or fructosamine in conjunction with biomarker levels, for valid
screening of diabetes and prediabetes among PLHIV."

This application seeks three years of dissertation funding to have a computational PhD candidate confront a
pressing public health issue using three interrelated, interdisciplinary aims supported by concomitant mentorship
and training that will prepare them for a future academic career in using statistical, computational and mixed-
methods techniques to develop and analyze interventions to address the opioid crisis. Over 9.5 million people
reported using opioids in the US in 2020, during which time there were ~257 opioid-related overdose deaths per
day. Fatal overdose rates have grown nationally by 274% from 2013 to 2020, largely due to the growing presence
of synthetic opioids and other additives, primarily found in street drug supplies. Street-obtained substances with
unexpected composition, such as cocaine containing fentanyl or heroin with novel fentanyl and benzodiazepine
derivatives, have been causing overdoses en masse. To mitigate the scale of these mass injury events, over
3000 agencies in 49 states use the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program [ODMAP], which features
a “spike alert”-based warning system. ODMAP issues a spike alert when overdose counts exceed preset
thresholds within 24 hours to help mobilize rapid public health responses to prevent overdoses and save lives.
The state of Connecticut has one of the highest overdose rates in the country, with 39.1 out of every 100,000
people experiencing a fatal overdose in 2020. To address this crisis, it has implemented one of the most
progressive evidence-based overdose spike response systems in the nation, with each ODMAP spike alert
undergoing an extensive manual review by the Department of Public Health that occasionally culminates in a
public health alert. The effectiveness of this system rests on its ability to accurately identify spikes and rapidly
mobilize a public health response to save lives, but it is unclear 1) if the system has any effect on overdose rates
2) how first responders, harm reduction organizations and health systems make use of the system to rapidly
respond to overdose spikes 3) if the system can be modified to more accurately identify spikes and motivate
rapid responses to save lives. I therefore propose to 1) estimate the causal effect of Connecticut’s current spike
alert system on subsequent overdose-related outcomes; 2) assess utilization of the current system, barriers to
overdose prevention and opinions on alternatives to the status quo; and 3) develop and simulate the impact of
alternative spike alert strategies on overdose-related outcomes. To address these Aims, I will use a combination
of cutting-edge causal inference, mixed-methods, space-time regression and epidemiological modeling
techniques, along with integrated data sources and guidance from key stakeholders. These findings will provide
actionable advice to improve Connecticut’s current spike alert system, can motivate future policy work to address
the overdose crisis and provide a framework for other health departments looking to implement spike alert
systems that are responsive to stakeholder needs and can more effectively save lives than the status quo."

Vaccines save lives, and the rapid development of novel vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was a triumph for the medical community. While the rapid deployment of these
vaccines has undoubtedly attenuated the severe morbidity and mortality induced by the virus, their efficacy is
decreased against variant strains, in children, and with increasing time post-administration. These clinical
findings highlight our lack of understanding of how durable, protective immunity is induced by vaccination and
how this varies across the population. Studying vaccine induced memory in humans has two major challenges.
First, viral exposures over life confound the identification of vaccine-specific memory; second, the stores of
memory lymphocytes reside in the tissues, which makes monitoring the vaccine response in healthy individuals
challenging. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affords us the unique opportunity to study the response to a novel
vaccine formulation without confounding natural antigenic exposure and the ability to distinguish infection from
vaccination by serology. Additionally, our unique organ donor tissue resource provides a validated model to
investigate tissue-localized vaccine-specific immunity. The goal of this proposal is to understand how vaccine-
induced immune memory is distributed across tissue and affected by host factors such as age. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that induction and maintenance of vaccine-specific memory is controlled in
lymph nodes, and specific early induction events directly impact immune memory development and
vary with age. I will address this hypothesis and meet the goals of the study by using flow cytometry and high-
dimensional sequencing to evaluate the relationship between circulating and tissue-localized vaccine memory
and how they differ in phenotype, function, and across age. I will also investigate how the initial, inflammatory
host-specific response to the mRNA-1273 vaccine differs across age and correlates to the quantity of immune
memory induced. The results of this study will elucidate the importance of lymph nodes in the vaccine
response and highlight the benefits and downfalls of mRNA vaccines across various host factors. These
results will have implications for future vaccine design and may play a role in managing both the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic and any future ones."
10915441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a grave neurodegenerative disorder characterized by unrelenting memory loss and
deficits in executive function with no effective treatment. Accumulating evidence from genome wide association
studies (GWAS) posit that the brain’s innate immune system plays a central role in AD etiology. As the central
nervous system’s resident immune cells, microglia have thus emerged as attractive cells to target therapeutically.
Such drug targets may lie within the MS4A locus, a region associated with protection from AD, later age-at-
onset, and increased levels of sTREM2, a biomarker of microglial activity. This region contains multiple genes
within the membrane-spanning 4-domain subfamily A (MS4A) gene cluster, which together encode structurally
related transmembrane proteins largely expressed by immune cells whose exact functions are not yet
understood. Our work nominated a candidate causal variant within this locus, rs636317, which disrupts an anchor
binding site for the chromatin remodeling protein CTCF and is associated with increased expression of MS4A4A
and MS4A6A in myeloid cells. This proposal aims to directly test the hypothesis that by modulating MS4A4A and
MS4A6A expression via differential CTCF binding, variant rs636317 alters microglial cell function in the context
of disease. In AIM 1, I will determine the functional impact of MS4A genes in vitro using CRISPR-edited human
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iMGL). Given known interactions between MS4A proteins
and other immune receptors such as TREM2 and CLEC7A, I will perform targeted functional assays related to
immune signaling in iMGLs from two iPSC models: MS4A4A/MS4A6A knockout lines and isogenic lines
homozygous for the protective or risk alleles of the candidate causal variant. In AIM 2, I will employ a novel
xenotransplantation model involving direct injection of human microglia precursor cells into the mouse brain to
evaluate the effect of these genes on cell function in vivo and in the context of disease using 5xFAD chimeric
mice. I hypothesize that knocking out MS4A4A and MS4A6A in human microglia promotes protective microglial
responses, ameliorating plaque containment and subsequent cognitive decline. Elucidating the function of this
gene family and the specific role it plays in AD progression has the potential to greatly impact public health. The
proposed research and rigorous training plan outlined here will equip me with the skills needed for a successful
future career in neurodegeneration leading an independent research team."
10889270,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Due to the increasing availability of ART, people living with HIV (PLWH) are surviving longer and achieving life
expectancies similar to the general population. While this is a great achievement, noncommunicable diseases
such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) now account for a significant proportion of the morbidity and mortality in
PLWH. Poor HTN medication adherence is associated with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) and increased
risk of CVD events such as myocardial infarction. Despite this risk, medication adherence research in PLWH is
primarily focused on ART with limited focus on adherence to other chronic comorbidities.
Medication adherence is a complex health behaviour that is driven by confluence of factors that operate at
micro- and macro-levels. As people age with HIV, their needs increase beyond solely managing HIV
medication adherence, to include management of other conditions and their medications. Increased pill burden
faced by older adults living with HIV (OALWH) with HTN, coupled with decline in cognitive function, cost of
transportation to the facility to get medication refill and lack of social support worsen adherence. Differences in
access particularly in LMICs, where ART is free and HTN medication are not, wider adverse effect profiles of
HTN drugs, and lack of polypills in HTN care could also contribute to non-adherence. Adherence support for
OALWH with HTN targeted at these factors may help improve medication adherence and reduce CVD events.
In this K43 application, the applicant proposes a training plan that will enable her gain skills and expertise in
human-centered design approach, implementation science theories, models and frameworks, and economic
evaluation of health interventions. Her research will addressing the following specific aims: Co-design a novel
CHV-led model for medication adherence support (CBA intervention) for OALWH using a human-centered
design approach (Aim 1); Conduct a pilot of CBA intervention and evaluate its feasibility (Aim2); and Conduct
costing and budget impact analysis of CBA intervention (Aim 3). The proposed K43 career development
activities including the outcome of the proposed research will culminate in my transition to an independent
researcher (R01-funded), contributing in the field of HIV and aging."

Pathologically altered affective learning is central to accounts of nearly every psychiatric disorder including
depression and anxiety disorders. In humans, non-human primates, and rodents accurately learning which
stimuli in our environment predict rewards or punishments is dependent on parts of frontal cortex, striatum, and
limbic system, such as amygdala. A considerable amount is known about the neural mechanisms that are
associated with adaptive patterns of learning within the circuits connecting these areas. What happens to these
patterns of neural activity and the specific pathways involved when learning is enhanced or diminished by
psychological processes is much less clear. Obtaining this knowledge is important as it would begin to reveal
the specific mechanisms through which learning can be altered, information that is essential for identifying
biomarkers in and aiding therapies for individuals with pathologically altered learning. Consequently, our aim
here is to begin to establish how bottom-up and top-down processes impact stimulus-reward learning at the level
of single neurons and circuit-level interactions. We specifically focus on the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC)
and amygdala as prior work in macaque monkeys has shown that these areas, as opposed to other parts of
frontal cortex and striatum, are required for efficient probabilistic stimulus-reward learning. These two areas are
also reciprocally connected and, based on neuroimaging investigations functionally interact during learning
further suggesting that they form part of a functional circuit essential for stimulus-reward learning. Our hypothesis
is that bottom-up and top-down influences on learning impact neural activity within and communication between
ventrolateral PFC and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala but that bottom-up and top-down learning do so
through different mechanisms and pathways. We will test our hypothesis by recording activity in ventrolateral
PFC and basolateral amygdala as well as interconnected parts of orbital PFC and striatum in macaques learning
in a probabilistic stimulus-reward task. We will assess functional interaction between areas using recurrent neural
network models and measures of coherence when learning is altered by either bottom-up (aim 1) or top-down
(aim 2) processes. To test the causal role of pathways linking amygdala and ventrolateral PFC we will also use
chemogenetic approaches to selectively inhibit activity in these circuits. Thus, using an innovative combination
of behavioral tasks, neural recordings, chemogenetic neuromodulation, and computational approaches we will
establish the patterns of neural activity within and causal importance of PFC-amygdala pathways to bottom-up
and top-down influences on learning. Completing these experiments will shed light on the specific neural
mechanisms and pathways associated with altered learning, information essential for determining the processes
that go awry in psychiatric disorders."
10908721,"CORAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP CORE - ABSTRACT
Maternal behavioral health conditions, including substance use disorders, affect 1 in 5 pregnant/postpartum
women and are one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related death. In the US, where population-wide
maternal mortality is higher than that in similar nations, Black women are three times more likely to die from a
pregnancy-related cause than White counterparts. Multiple factors, including multilayered structural and social
determinants affecting the complex physical, mental, and behavioral health milieu, contribute to this racial
disparity. Thus, maternal behavioral health represents one important area for investigation and innovation to
improve lifecourse and intergenerational outcomes for Black women and birthing people. To date, predominant
approaches to addressing Black maternal behavioral health have not appropriately and rigorously engaged
community stakeholders. In many instances, proposed solutions have perpetuated medical/academic mistrust
and have failed to create sustainable, equitable change. Experts agree that the lived experiences and cultural
knowledge of Black birthing people, and community bodies who serve them, are integral in identifying effective
public health solutions. We posit that, to drastically reduce pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated
maternal deaths among Black women with behavioral health conditions, community voices must be prioritized
and amplified. To this end, the Community Partnership Core (CPC) will lead the creation, cultivation, and
maintenance of a cooperative and equitable partnership between the Center to Advance Reproductive Justice
and Behavioral Health among Black pregnant/postpartum women (CORAL) and all relevant community
partners at each stage of the research process, from conceptualization to wide dissemination and translation
for varied audiences. Using and expanding upon established reproductive justice, research justice, and
community engagement frameworks, and leveraging a trans-disciplinary team of research and community
partners we will: (1) Develop an effective CPC Community Accountability Board (CAB); (2) Engage
communities to develop a CPC Community Accountability Board Research Agenda to advance Black Maternal
Behavioral Health; (3) Develop infrastructure to support the achievement of the CPC CAB Research Agenda,
and CORAL projects more broadly; and (4) Apply innovative methods to disseminate and implement CORAL
research learnings with community members, partner organizations, and policymakers utilizing culturally-
rooted approaches. We anticipate that, through our intentionally constructed research team, community
partnerships, and leveraging of our existing state-and-nationwide capacity, we will be able to support the
implementation of sustainable maternal behavioral health interventions to improve maternal health outcomes.
Working in partnership with communities, and those who serve Black pregnant and postpartum women, the
CPC's work has the potential activate the power of communities and inform policies and practices for
practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and activists so that Black mothers not just survive but thrive."
10908723,"ABSTRACT - CORAL Training Core
Ending the maternal behavioral health crisis among Black women requires developing a new generation of
scientists, evidence, and interventions that (1) bridges historically siloed approaches to behavioral health and
maternal health, and (2) is authentically community engaged. Developing this new generation of scientists,
evidence, and interventions requires a paradigm shift in how we train and who we train as research
investigators and as knowledge producers. It requires a transdisciplinary approach to identifying and
intervening in the multilayered factors that that shape maternal behavioral health conditions among Black
women, and demands effective training in ethically engaging communities for just knowledge production and
impactful translation. The CORAL Training Core is designed to develop this new generation of scientists,
evidence, and interventions that will help end the maternal behavioral health crisis among Black women. It will
serve a pivotal role in promoting community-engaged research, developing early-stage investigators (ESIs),
and building transdisciplinary research capacity at the intersection of maternal health and behavioral health
with a focus on Black pregnant and postpartum women. It will leverage unique strengths of CORAL’s
Community Partnership Core and established relationships across Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory
University, and community partners to weave a focus on ethical community-engaged research into its
approach to: (1) Provide mentoring and career development for ESIs, with a particular focus on URM ESIs; (2)
Build research capacity among ESIs and established investigators for effective, ethical, community-engaged
research and dissemination; (3) Develop and administer a CORAL Project Program to provide >$520,000 in
research funding – most leveraged via in-kind support - for ESI, particularly URMs, to support their career
development in maternal behavioral health research and interventions with Black pregnant/ postpartum
women; and (4) Enhance collaboration with non-academic partners and other Centers of Excellence. The
Training Core will be co-led by two faculty with complementary training, experience, and expertise: Dr. Dawn
Tyus, Project Director and Principal Investigator for the African American Behavioral Health Center of
Excellence at Morehouse School of Medicine, and Dr. Michael Kramer, Director of the Maternal and Child
Health Center of Excellence at Emory Rollins School of Public Health. By achieving its aims, CORAL’s Training
Core will develop the next generation of transdisciplinary, community-engaged scientists, evidence, and
interventions needed to end the maternal behavioral health crisis among Black women."
10755293,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tumors elicit a range of suppressive mechanisms in order to evade the immune system. Many of these are
targetable as evidenced by the great success of cancer immunotherapies that boost a patient's own immune
response towards cancer. Often, targets for cancer immunotherapies represent pathways that at homeostasis
protect against activation of an immune response towards self, limiting the development of autoimmune
disease. Cancer patients treated with immune-potentiating therapies are exposed to significant risk of
developing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These irAEs have been reported in nearly every organ
system, and in many cases represent non-resolving autoimmune side-effects that pose a significant impact
due to their potential morbidity, mortality and associated healthcare costs. With a growing number of
immunotherapies reaching clinical utility and increasing combination studies that may initiate more frequent
and severe irAEs, understanding which therapeutic approaches provide improved tumor control with minimal
side-effects is essential. In this study, by generating transplantable, syngeneic tumor cell lines in autoimmune-
prone NOD mice, which develop autoimmune pathologies in response to cancer immunotherapies, we may
begin to assess the interplay between irAEs and anti-tumor immunity. In-depth profiling of genetic, epigenetic
and cellular mechanisms that separate anti-tumor immunity versus autoimmunity in response to cancer
immunotherapies will be defined to better engineer therapeutic strategies that enhance the immune response
towards tumor with limited impact towards self. Using NOD tumors resistant to clinically-approved cancer
immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, combination therapeutic strategies that reinvigorate
immune activation in the tumor microenvironment will be identified and the associated risk for precipitating
irAEs determined. Together, these preclinical models provide a platform to assess safety profiles for cancer
immunotherapies, identifying mechanisms to inhibit or avoid irAEs while preserving anti-tumor immunity. This
research will be performed amongst world-class scientists and facilities at the University of California, San
Francisco, this environment will foster expert training in the analysis of high-dimensional datasets generated
from CyTOF and 10X single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, an essential skill for delineating the complex
mechanisms contributing to immune-mediated disease. Both my mentorship committee, led by Dr. Jeffrey
Bluestone and expert collaborators will allow me to fulfil these research goals. Following, I will transition to an
independent position establishing a research program that integrates the effect of multiple environmental
factors, including microbiome, diet, age and stress, alongside autoimmune and anti-tumor immune responses
to cancer immunotherapy using the NOD tumor models that have been developed, with the ultimate aim to
improve safety, specificity and treatment efficacy for immunotherapy-treated cancer patients."

Determining how individuals differ in their metabolism, and in their response to dietary intake, is critical to
developing personalized intervention strategies for preventing and delaying the onset of chronic diseases such
as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The MCAC will a) acquire and process high quality
targeted and untargeted metabolomics data, b) prioritize, predict, and confirm the identity of unknown peaks, c)
provide CLIA certified clinical assays, d) collaborate with the Common Fund Data Ecosystem, e) construct a data
infrastructure which ensures FAIRness and enables interoperability of the data with other Common Fund data
sets, and f) collaboratively work with the NIH Common Fund Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) Consortium.
The MCAC brings an outstanding team of investigators from 3 UNC Systems Universities that are co-located on
the North Carolina Research Campus (NCRC) and Duke University. Dr. Susan Sumner (UNC Chapel Hill,
Nutrition Research Institute, NCRC, Untargeted Metabolomics) will serve as the PI with support from expert
scientists who specialize in nutrition and targeted metabolomics of host metabolism (Dr. Christopher Newgard,
Director, Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute), dietary
interventions and targeted phytochemical analysis (Dr. Colin Kay, North Carolina State University, NCRC), CLIA
certified clinical assays (Dr. Steven Cotten, UNCCH), and Computational Metabolomics (Dr. Xiuxia Du, UNC
Charlotte, NCRC). Our team provides a unique combination of long-standing expertise in metabolomics
technologies, coupled with deep knowledge of nutrition, metabolic physiology, and chronic disease mechanisms.
We are experienced with the application of targeted and untargeted metabolomics in large-scale clinical and
epidemiology studies, including in other NIH Consortia. We have used metabolomics to define metabolic
signatures and pathways associated with dietary intake, nutrition assessments, demographics, lifestyle factors,
microbial populations, genetics, transcriptomics, clinical assays, and clinical phenotypes of health and wellness.
We have developed comprehensive informatics capabilities for targeted and untargeted metabolomics and
exposome research. We have developed an online mass spectral knowledge base resource for prioritizing and
predicting unknown metabolites by leveraging publicly available data. Our high quality MCAC datasets produced
under fine-tuned protocols with quality control and quality assurance metrics, will be essential for success of the
NPH Consortium. The MCAC will provide data and expert biological interpretation in exploration of the
heterogeneity in metabolism among study subjects, providing a roadmap that will help explain why individuals
differ in their metabolic responses to dietary interventions, and what this portends for future disease risk. The
MCAC will provide a robust data set to the Artificial Intelligence for Multimodal Data Modeling and Bioinformatics
Center for use in development of algorithms to predict individual dietary responses that can ultimately be
translated for design of targeted dietary interventions to improve health and quality of life."

The rate of HIV diagnosis among Black cisgender women in Louisiana is almost 7 times higher than of White
cisgender women. Multi-level implementation strategies are critically needed to reduce HIV infections among
Black cisgender women in New Orleans, Louisiana (NOLA), an Ending the Epidemic priority jurisdiction. Using
findings from our recently-conducted qualitative interviews with Black cisgender women and contributions from
NOLA’s Black Women and PrEP Task Force, we have identified two main barriers that limit PrEP uptake
among Black cisgender women in NOLA: (1) Black cisgender women do not know of other Black cisgender
women taking PrEP, and (2) Black cisgender women are not offered PrEP during routine medical care. To
address these determinants, we propose to develop and pilot a Start the Conversation Initiative that includes
implementation strategies at the patient and provider levels. Aim 1 focuses on developing the patient-level
implementation strategy, a social media campaign. Working with the Black Women and PrEP Task Force and
a local community-based organization that specializes in social media campaigns, we will determine the
content of the social media messages and the type of social media to use. We will conduct 4 focus group
discussions with Black cisgender women to pre-test the social media content. Aim 2 focuses on developing the
provider-level implementation strategies. We will develop a combined-care PrEP model that encourages GYN
residents to (1) start a PrEP conversation with their patients and help them to determine if PrEP is right for
them, and (2) help their patients to determine the best location of PrEP follow-up—either with the GYN
residency clinic or with a routine PrEP provider. We will conduct 12 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with GYN and
routine PrEP providers and establish a working group of GYN residents, GYN residency directors, and current
PrEP providers to inform the combined-care PrEP model. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the implementation of the
Start the Conversation Initiative. We will pilot the strategies at the Louisiana State University (LSU) GYN
residency program over an 8-month period to inform acceptability, feasibility and potential impact. We will first
implement the provider-level strategies, then layer in the patient-level strategies to examine impact on patient
demand (PrEP uptake) and retention. The 8 months of combined implementation will be compared to PrEP
uptake from a comparison GYN clinic at Tulane; one month retention in care outcomes will be measured at
LSU. Implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, maintenance) will be assessed through chart review and
triangulated with resident feedback sessions. We will also conduct 24 IDIs each with providers (n=12) and
patients (n=12) to further inform acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness. At the end of the R34, we plan to
submit a larger implementation research proposal with additional sites in the U.S. South to evaluate these
optimized community-identified implementation strategies."
10755299,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) are a key driver of morbidity,
mortality, and health care costs. A subset of COPD patients experience frequent ECOPD, and have a
particularly poor prognosis. ECOPD are often caused by infections with encapsulated bacteria such as
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and there is growing evidence that frequent exacerbators have
impaired adaptive immune responses. Prior studies have demonstrated associations between ECOPD and low
IgG and IgG subclass levels, as well as downregulation of genes associated with adaptive immune pathways.
Impaired pneumococcal antibody function (PAF) and specific IgG2 variants (allotypes) are associated with
increased risk of encapsulated bacterial infections in primary immunodeficiencies, however these factors have
not been studied in COPD. The multiplexed opsonophagocytosis assay (MOPA) measures PAF via killing of
pneumococci by serum antibodies in vitro, and is the primary method for measuring immune responses to
pneumococcal vaccines in adults. Preliminary studies indicate that PAF can also be used to evaluate immune
function in COPD, and that lower PAF is associated with frequent exacerbations over the previous year.
 The central hypothesis for this proposal is that PAF and IgG2 allotype can predict a COPD subgroup
with increased ECOPD risk. To investigate this hypothesis, PAF and IgG2 allotype will be measured in blood
samples previously collected from the multicenter SPIROMICS cohort. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine
whether low baseline PAF predicts risk of future ECOPD. The objective of Aim 2 is to determine whether low
PAF predicts a chronic bronchitis COPD phenotype with neutrophilia and airway-dominant imaging. Reference
levels for PAF will be established using results from a non-COPD cohort, then used to identify a PAF-deficient
COPD subgroup. We will determine whether PAF deficiency is associated the above phenotypes. Aim 3 will
investigate whether the IgG2 allotype associated with low PAF is more common among frequent exacerbators,
versus non-exacerbating COPD and non-COPD controls.
 The results of this study could identify novel COPD subgroups and risk factors for exacerbations.
Findings from this study may also promote the development of individualized therapeutic approaches tailored
to those with low antibody function. The proposed research and career development plans are made possible
through the mentorship of Dr. Moon Nahm, an international expert in pneumococcal immune responses, and
Dr. Mark Dransfield, a leader in clinical and translational COPD research. The proposal also includes training
in laboratory techniques, biostatistics, clinical and translational research, microbiology, and immunology, in
order to foster an independent research career with a focus on immune dysfunction in COPD."
10747871,"Although new therapies have had an impact prolonging the quality and quantity of life of men suffering from
prostate cancer (PCa), novel treatments are urgently needed to combat aggressive forms of the disease.
Recently, we made several key discoveries in the development of therapeutic peptides targeting the membrane
bound metalloprotease aminopeptidase N (APN) in aggressive subtypes of PCa. To accurately and reliably
interrogate the expression of APN in PCa tissues, we identified a novel antibody by phage display that specifically
recognized APN in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues. This antibody allowed us to screen PCa tissue
microarrays (TMAs) with a fidelity never before seen. Immunohistochemistry analysis of patient biopsies and
TMAs found that APN was preferentially overexpressed in non-androgen receptor (AR) driven PCa compared to
AR-driven prostate adenocarcinoma. We also documented in a race disparity TMA and patient biopsies that
APN was expressed in the PCa of African-American men while absent in Caucasian patients. Both African-
American men and men with non-AR driven PCa represent patient populations who exhibit aggressive disease
with poor overall survival. Using a rational design approach based off of the substrate specificity of APN, we
identified a cyclic peptide (Leu-His-Ser-Pro-Trp = cLHSPW) that was a micromolar inhibitor of APN’s enzymatic
activity. This peptide was found to be moderately therapeutic in APN-expressing PCa xenografts at high doses.
Tethering of two cLHSPW peptides together by a linker created a dimer with enhanced potency in vitro and in
vivo. The dimer was a nanomolar inhibitor of APN and was rapidly internalized by the cancer cell. When
administered at the same high dose as the monomer, the dimer led to complete tumor attrition in vivo. These
findings suggest that higher order multivalent cLHSPW peptides may be effective APN-targeted therapeutics. In
this proposal, we will synthesize dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric cLHSPW peptides using macrocyclic frames.
In addition to ease of synthesis, the macrocyclic frames can also chelate radiometals for positron-emission
tomography (PET). To develop a new class of PCa therapeutics, the in vitro therapeutic efficacy of the peptides
will be characterized and PET imaging will be performed in vivo to monitor biodistribution (Aim 1), the ability of
the peptides to eliminate tumor burden in subcutaneous xenografts will be examined (Aim 2) and X-ray
crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be performed on APN complexed with the peptides to obtain
mechanistic insights and ultimately lead to the development of optimized inhibitors (Aim 3). Our preliminary data
strongly suggest that we have developed potent therapeutics that have the potential to result in a dramatic shift
in how aggressive PCa is treated."
10755695,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Arboviruses maintained in a human-mosquito-human transmission cycle are responsible for fueling periodic
outbreaks worldwide and are an increasing public health threat. A critical feature of arbovirus transmission cycles,
and a major determinant of their geographic spread and pathogenesis, is the magnitude and duration of viremia
in vertebrate hosts. However, few studies have investigated the molecular determinants of viremia. Recent
studies published by the Morrison laboratory demonstrated that the murine scavenger receptor MARCO on liver
macrophages removes chikungunya (CHIKV) particles and other arthritogenic alphaviruses, including Ross
River (RRV) and o’nyong ‘nyong (ONNV) viruses, from murine circulation due to recognition of the lysine (K)
residue at position 200 of CHIKV and ONNV E2 glycoprotein and 251 of RRV E2 glycoprotein. My preliminary
studies further revealed that CHIKV clearance is also abrogated when mutations were introduced at glutamate
(E)208 of E2 and K61 of E1 glycoproteins, and mass spectrometry analysis of the biochemical features important
for viral clearance suggested that E1 K61 is methylated. Further analysis of position 208 of CHIKV E2
glycoprotein revealed the importance of a negative charge at this position for CHIKV removal from circulation.
As a pattern recognition receptor, MARCO recognizes modified self and non-self molecules, and polymorphisms
in human MARCO can predispose carriers to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Because the scavenger
receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain of MARCO is a binding site for endogenous ligands, such as modified
low-density lipoprotein, I hypothesize that the SRCR domain of MARCO stably and noncovalently interacts
with an exposed interface between the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV, allowing for the removal of
viral particles from circulation and a reduction in both the magnitude and duration of viremia. In Aim 1,
I will define the residues and biochemical features of CHIKV important for MARCO-dependent clearance from
circulation by manipulating surface features of virus particles, assessing how specific mutations impact viral
dissemination, and identifying post-translational modifications at specific sites in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins. In
Aim 2, I will elucidate the sites on MARCO responsible for binding arthritogenic alphaviruses with cell-based and
biochemical approaches. In addition, I will determine the extent to which virus particles interact with human
MARCO, and whether known polymorphisms in MARCO affect virus-MARCO interactions, viremia, or clinical
outcomes. Taken together, by defining the molecular mechanism of interaction between MARCO and CHIKV,
this proposal could provide insights into factors that influence alphaviral pathogenesis, elucidate the relationship
between MARCO polymorphisms and viremia, and identify individuals or populations with an increased
susceptibility to severe alphaviral infections and outbreaks, respectively."

 Mounting evidence suggests that hearing loss is associated with social isolation, depression and
cognitive decline. Loss of hearing has become a growing public health concern. For those with no available or
affordable hearing healthcare resources, the negative effects of hearing loss are most likely worse when
compared to those with access to hearing healthcare. By improving access to care for all, we can help to
mitigate the negative effects of hearing loss. The proposal outlined in this application specifically addresses
concerns of NIDCD discussed in RFA-DC-19-001 related to the delivery of effective rehabilitation interventions
in communities, in addition to identifying minimal technology that will achieve success for those who have mild-
to-moderate hearing loss. The long term goals of this line of research are to understand how limited access to
hearing health care affects those who live in persistently poor regions of the state, and additionally, to identify
intervention strategies that will effectively address the needs of those who live in these areas. This individually
randomized group treatment clinical trial will use community-based participatory research (CBPR) to
understand and address the needs of those with hearing loss and their families living in underserved
communities of West Central and South Alabama. The specific aims are to 1) conduct a CBPR needs
assessment that will refine our understanding of specific hearing health care needs for those with no access to
hearing health care in West Central and South Alabama; 2) develop an effective community health advisor
(CHA) aural rehabilitation (AR) training program; 3) identify the effectiveness of personal sound amplification
products (PSAPs) for decreasing hearing handicap and improving speech perception in adults with no access
to hearing health care, and 4) implement an adult aural rehabilitation (AR) program for those without access to
hearing health care to improve PSAP benefit, promote PSAP use and lead to increased quality of life (QOL).
Following the needs assessment and training program for community health coordinators and advisors, an
intervention plan will be implemented consisting of personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) and an
aural rehabilitation (AR) program for adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss who have no access to hearing
healthcare. It is hypothesized that PSAP use will significantly decrease hearing handicap and improve speech
perception. A second hypothesis is that compared to adults who did not receive the AR program, PSAP benefit
and use will be greater, communication in difficult listening conditions will be better, and QOL will be positively
affected for those who did participate in the AR program. Vital to this project is our state-of-the-art mobile
audiology clinic which will travel to remote areas of West Central and South Alabama, making Alabama
uniquely poised to examine the effects of hearing loss on those who live in completely rural areas and
persistent poverty regions."
10758194,"The discovery of the antiviral APOBEC3 (A3) proteins is regarded as one of the most therapeutically
promising breakthroughs in HIV/AIDS molecular virology. Four different A3 proteins have the capacity
to restrict HIV replication by incorporating into assembling viral particles, physically interfering with the
progression of reverse transcription, and deaminating viral cDNA cytosines to uracils. The latter
antiviral activity is the defining hallmark of A3-mediated restriction, explaining the genomic strand G-
to-A mutations that are frequently observed in patient-derived viral sequences. In the next phase of
this ongoing project, we will focus on addressing two related questions, which are regarded as major
“black boxes” in the field. Namely, how are the HIV-1 restrictive A3s regulated post-translationally, and
how do these regulatory mechanisms effect the RNA-mediated process of encapsidation, which is an
essential step in the overall virus restriction mechanism? These questions will be answered by
combining comprehensive proteomics, genetics, and next- generation sequencing datasets to identify
specific and shared A3 regulatory factors. A combination of genetics, cell biology, virology,
biochemistry, and bioinformatics approaches will be used to delineate underlying molecular
mechanisms. These studies are anticipated to lead to novel strategies to therapeutically boost the
anti-HIV-1 activities of these enzymes and potentially contribute to a longer-term virus eradication
plan."
10763398,"This is a proposal for renewal of RO1 MH053608 that examines the immediate early gene Arc, its role in activity-
dependent synaptic plasticity, and its contribution to diseases that impact mental health. Our plans focus on a
novel function of Arc that mediates AKT signaling down-stream of the NMDA receptor. This mechanism is distinct
from canonical functions of Arc that mediate synaptic scaling and long-term depression. Preliminary studies
suggest that NMDAR-Arc-AKT signaling stabilizes NMDAR expression at the membrane and may contribute to
metaplastic synaptic potentiation. NMDAR, Arc and AKT are each suspected hubs for schizophrenia, and
proposed studies seek to understand both the natural function of NMDAR-Arc-AKT signaling and how disruption
of this pathway may contribute to schizophrenia. Aim 1 examines the protein composition, assembly, NMDA
receptor pharmacology, synapse specificity of the signaling pathway, and its role in synaptic plasticity. Aim 2
examines NMDAR-Arc-AKT signaling in vivo and examines its hypothesized role to potentiate D1 receptor
signaling, its role in the establishment of behaviorally linked ensembles of excitatory neurons, and to discover
adaptions to disruption of the pathway that cause hyperdopaminergic signaling. Aim 3 tests the prediction that
NMDAR-Arc-AKT signaling is important for adaptation to stress that can induce schizophrenia-like
endophenotypes in vulnerable animals, and examines a hypothetical mechanism that is based on human and
mouse studies suggesting failure of interneuron mechanisms. Aim 4 will examine the NMDAR-Arc-AKT complex
and signaling in human brain and iPS neurons in collaboration with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development.
Studies will create and compare protein and RNAseq biomarkers from mouse models representing failure of
NMDAR-Arc-AKT complex formation and signaling, and compare these with best available databases from
human subjects with well characterized genetic load for schizophrenia. Our hope is to confirm a role for the
NMDAR-Arc-AKT pathway as a basis for risk in polygenetic human disease."
10763863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spread of neuroinvasive herpesviruses from sensory neurons to the eye, brain, or from mother to
newborn, are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and
pseudorabies virus (PRV) are representative members of the two genuses of mammalian
neuroinvasive herpesviruses (simplexviruses & varicelloviruses). These viruses are dependent upon
spread to the nervous system to establish life-long latent infections, yet very little is known regarding
the neuroinvasive mechanism that underlies this remarkable trait. We propose to study the virus
neuroinvasive machinery with the intent to: (i) decipher how these viruses invade the nervous system,
(ii) understand the intrinsic barriers to neural infection that these viruses evade, and (iii) produce and
characterize viruses lacking the neuroinvasive property as potential vaccines and recombinant vectors.
These studies are designed to identify the virus-cellular interactions that promote virus genome delivery
to the nuclei of non-neuronal and neuronal cells, and the corresponding intrinsic defenses that keep
most pathogens at bay. We include preliminary data demonstrating that this path-breaking collaborative
study has far-reaching medical and biological implications."
10915588,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The biological process heretofore implicated in MERTK loss-of-function-associated Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is
defective phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) leading
to photoreceptor (PR) degeneration. Here we propose a shift in this paradigm. We have demonstrated that the
precise genetic ablation of Mertk in mice (Mertk -/- V2) results in deficient phagocytosis, but not PR degeneration.
Furthermore, PR degeneration in the original Mertk knockout (Mertk -/- V1 that is hypomorphic from Tyro3) or Mertk
-/- V2 Tyro3 -/- V2 mice is associated with RPE inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that loss of MERTK anti-
inflammatory signaling in the RPE is a critical event leading to RP. To test this hypothesis, we propose to (i)
conditionally ablate Mertk in Tyro3 -/- RPE to test if this recapitulates RPE inflammation seen in germline Mertk -
/- V1 and Mertk -/- V2 Tyro3 -/- V2 mice. An alternate possibility, RPE inflammation when Mertk is conditionally ablated
in Tyro3 -/- RPE notwithstanding, is that inflammation is a secondary consequence of loss of MERTK-mediated
phagocytosis and the consequent build-up of POS debris. We do not see POS build up even at 6 months in
Mertk -/- V2 or Mertk -/- V3 mice. We also detect RPE inflammation before eye opening (at p10) and thus inflammation
in the absence of MERTK is likely primary. To directly test this, (ii) we have generated a unique set of mouse
models wherein either the phagocytosis or anti-inflammatory signaling function of MERTK has been exclusively
mutated, leaving the remaining function intact. These mouse models will allow us to definitively test the outcome
of loss of MERTK-mediated phagocytosis alone in PR degeneration, as well as uncouple the effects of loss of
MERTK anti-inflammatory signaling alone from that of loss of MERTK-mediated phagocytosis. Complementing
these studies, we will test the orthologous mutations in differentiated human primary RPE in terms of their effect
on inducing RPE inflammation in presence or absence of POS. If inflammation underlies the etiology of MERTK
loss-of-function-associated RP, can it be therapeutically targeted to protect against vision loss? (iii) We have
obtained promising preliminary data that the FDA-approved JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib reduces inflammatory
gene expression in the Mertk -/- V1 RPE and the severity of PR degeneration in Mertk -/- V1 mice. Building on this
proof-of-concept, we will optimize the ruxolitinib regimen (dose and duration of treatment) through dose-
escalation studies to determine maximum protection against PR degeneration and vision loss. Taken together,
these three independent, orthogonal approaches are expected to reveal mechanistic insight supporting a novel
role of inflammation within the RPE itself as causally relevant to MERTK loss-of-function-associated RP, as well
as, provide a therapeutic avenue using small molecule JAK1/2 inhibitors (“Jakinibs”) already in clinical use for
this severe, early-onset form of RP."

 There is a critical need to determine whether premature vascular disease observed in youth with type 2
diabetes (T2D) extends to the brain. This proposal builds on exciting data generated by our team showing
differences in brain structure and clinically meaningful declines in neurocognitive function among adolescents
with youth-onset T2D compared to their obese and lean peers. Our most prominent findings include lower brain
gray matter volume and lower scores on measures of working memory. Importantly, we have also demonstrated
some of the first evidence of cerebrovascular impairment in youth with T2D, manifested as reduced gray matter
cerebral blood flow. Finally, we have preliminary evidence that cerebral blood flow correlates with reduction in
gray matter volume and working memory measures. These findings suggest the breakdown of the neurovascular
unit (NVU), a physiological construct describing the interplay between brain vasculature, neurons, and supporting
glia and a mechanism for reduced brain volume and cognitive impairment. Our overarching hypothesis that
premature vascular disease observed in youth-onset T2D extends to the brain and is associated with structural
brain abnormalities and neurocognitive impairment. Importantly, we aim to differentiate the impact of T2D on the
brain from the effect of obesity. Thus, we will compare NVU in adolescents with T2D to age, sex and race similar
non-diabetic adolescents with obesity (obese controls) and without obesity (lean controls). Aim 1 will
comprehensively assess aspects of NVU structure and function and identify risk factors impacting the NVU; 2)
Aim 2 will determine the relationships between cerebrovascular, neuroanatomical, and cognitive outcomes
cross-sectionally, and 3) Aim 3 will evaluate changes in the NVU, brain structure and cognition over time. Our
team is well positioned to conduct this study as we have generated compelling preliminary data in our laboratory
(m-PI Shah & DiFrancesco), we have expertise in conducting research studies in youth with T2D with
documented ability to recruit and retain participants (m-PI Shah), we developed the state of the art MRI methods
to study the vasculature in our laboratory and have applied these to other diseases with vascular sequelae such
as systemic lupus erythematous (m-PI DiFrancesco), and we have extensive expertise in neurocognition and
brain-behavior research (co-I Beebe & m-PI DiFrancesco). Finally, we have documented collaboration between
the members of the study team over the last five years (Shah, DiFrancesco, Beebe & Altaye). The results of this
proposal will separate the effects of T2D from obesity, identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers of brain health
and treatable risk factors, and explore progression over time, positioning us to test interventions for youth with
T2D and obesity as an immediate next step."

The long-term goal of this project is to improve diagnosis and management of keratoconus.
The efficacy of corneal crosslinking for progressive keratoconus has generated interest in
detecting the disease at an earlier stage in hopes of preventing progression leading to vision
loss. Yet, there is currently no clinical evidence supporting the benefits of early treatment of
keratoconus with crosslinking. The primary barrier in designing studies that address this
question is the lack of diagnostic technology to identify keratoconus in the early stages. The
project addresses this technological need.
Current keratoconus diagnosis relies primarily on measurements of corneal shape. Since shape
changes are secondary to microstructural alterations, a method to image the corneal
microstructure could enable detection of keratoconus at an earlier stage. Alterations in the
corneal epithelium and Bowman’s layer are among the first histophatologic signs of
keratoconus. Our goal is to develop the first widefield OCT imaging modality to quantify
structural and optical alterations of the epithelium and Bowman’s layer from the center to the
periphery of the cornea. The technology will then be used to prove that alterations in Bowman’s
layer and epithelium can be quantified across the entire cornea in keratoconus subjects.
The project has two specific aims:
Aim 1: To develop Widefield Corneal Microlayer Tomography (wCMT). The technology is
based on high-resolution OCT combined with a new beam scanning approach to enable
widefield imaging of the cornea. We will develop OCT image processing tools to generate the
first volumetric thickness and optical scattering maps of the epithelium and Bowman’s layer over
the entire cornea. The system and software will be tested on healthy and keratoconus subjects.
Aim 2: To map the alterations of Bowman’s layer and epithelium over the entire cornea
with wCMT in keratoconus. We will prove that wCMT can quantify alterations in Bowman’s
layer and epithelium from the center to the periphery of the cornea. Data acquired on control
subjects and patients with early-stage to moderate keratoconus will be used to prove that wCMT
can detect alterations in Bowman’s layer and epithelium from the early stage of the disease.
In the long term, the technology will have an important positive impact as it lays the foundation
for the discovery of structural biomarkers that will enable the detection of keratoconus at an
earlier stage."
10869925,"Project Summary:
Hallucinations are common in clinical and nonclinical groups, can be difficult to treat, and often predict worsening
functionality. The poor efficacy and severe side effects of current treatments are in part a consequence of our
immature understanding of the mechanisms that cause hallucinations. Excess striatal dopamine release has
been causally implicated in the development and severity of hallucinations but the precise circuits and cognitive
processes that link this neurochemical alteration to false perception remain unclear. Evidence from the basic
neuroscience literature has inspired competing theories about how excess striatal dopamine drives
hallucinations. Specifically, reward and perceptual hypotheses of hallucinations have emerged, but they have
yet to be directly tested in a falsifiable framework. Identifying which of these hypothesized mechanisms drives
hallucinations is critically important given that reward and perceptual learning are facilitated by distinct
dopaminergic basal circuits each of which may provide a separate treatment target. We have developed a
mathematical framework that formalizes these hypotheses with biologically grounded computational models and
generated falsifiable predictions about how alterations in either perceptual or reward learning could drive
hallucinations.
Here, we will rigorously test the neural and behavioral predictions of these models using a novel fMRI-compatible
auditory signal-detection task and a validated proxy measure for midbrain dopamine function. In Aim 1, we will
evaluate participant perceptual and reward learning and the relationship with hallucination proneness. In Aim 2,
we will identify the neural circuits that support reward and perceptual learning during the task. In Aim 3, we will
use a validated proxy measure of dopamine function to dissociate the specific subcircuits driving alterations in
learning. Overall, the proposed study aims to bridge the explanatory gap between our understanding of the
neurochemistry and phenomenology of hallucinations. Critically, this could promote the identification of
individualized treatment targets that are not only more effective but have more limited side effects. This proposal
will also support my training in state-of-the-art computational modeling and neuroimaging approaches and
promote my development as an independent researcher in the field of computational psychiatry."
10975353,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders
characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias, bone marrow dysplasia, and ineffective hematopoiesis.
Approximately 50% of MDS, 60% chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 20% of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) harbor heterozygous mutations in spliceosome factor genes such as SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2.
Although many studies have shown that mutations in splicing factor genes lead to distinct patterns of aberrant
splicing, no specific alternatively spliced isoform has been demonstrated to directly cause MDS. However,
aberrations in splicing induced by splicing factor gene mutations create a vulnerability in MDS cells. Our group
and others showed that cells harboring spliceosome gene mutations have increased sensitivity to
pharmacological perturbation of the spliceosome by splicing modulator drugs. The sensitivity of spliceosome
mutant cells to further splicing perturbations raises the possibility that they are vulnerable to accumulation of
misspliced transcripts. A large portion of the misspliced RNAs caused by spliceosome mutations or splicing
modulator treatment are nonsense mRNAs that harbor premature termination codons (PTCs). These nonsense
mRNAs, which may cause deleterious effects if translated, are normally degraded by a RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). The prevalence of nonsense mRNAs in cancer cells with
spliceosome mutations leads us to hypothesize that mutant cells will be more sensitive to NMD attenuation due
to the role of NMD in the clearance of nonsense mRNAs that can be detrimental. Preliminary data from our group
indicate that NMD disruption (using a SMG1 inhibitor [SMG1i]) preferentially kills cancer cells expressing different
splicing factor gene mutations. This cell death is associated with the induction of R-loops and DNA damage.
Building on preliminary studies, we propose to test the therapeutic potential of NMD inhibition in selective killing
of spliceosome mutant cancer cells using in vivo models and define the underlying mechanism for the
hypersensitivity of spliceosome mutant cells to NMD attenuation. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the therapeutic
potential of NMD inhibition to selectively kill spliceosome mutant cancer cells using in vivo models. We will engraft
primary mouse AML cells in congenic mice and test whether in vivo treatment with a highly specific inhibitor of
SMG1 (SMG1i), the only known protein kinase that regulates the NMD pathway, can selectively kill cancer cells
with spliceosome mutations. We will further establish the therapeutic potential of targeting NMD by combining
SMG1i with ATR or PARP inhibitors, DNA damage repair proteins that are activated in splicing factor mutant
cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanism for the sensitivity of spliceosome mutant cells
to NMD attenuation. We will identify candidate NMD targets whose levels are modulated by SMG1i or mutant
splicing factors, potentially nominating downstream functional targets that could be modulated for cancer
treatment. Collectively, this project will nominate therapies to treat MDS and AML with splicing factor mutations."

My long-term career goal is to do hypothesis-driven research as an independent investigator at a university
spanning basic and clinical immunology in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In order to achieve this goal, I
have put together an advisory team composed of Dr. Matthew Olson (sponsor), Dr. Timothy Ratliff (co-sponsor),
Dr. Tzu-wen Cross (collaborator), Dr. Majid Kazemian (collaborator), Dr. Shihuan Kuang, and Dr. Wayne
Campbell to provide technical training for in vitro cell culture techniques, in vivo mouse models of intestinal
disease, and gnotobiotic training, as well as other professional development skills in scientific writing and
communication. My preliminary work outlined in this proposal has demonstrated that mice with conventional T
cell-specific deletions in two important T cell transcription factors, STAT3 and BATF, developed an aggressive
spontaneous colitis that was marked by a dysregulated microbiota and elevated numbers of γδ T cells in the
intestines similar to what is observed in human patients. Given that the current treatment options available for
IBD are not fully effective in long term treatment, my data indicate that disrupting this STAT3/BATF-axis through
targeting the dysregulated gut microbiota or γδ T cells may represent a novel therapeutic strategy. To further
understand this complex relationship between dysregulated gut microbiota and non-conventional γδ T cells in
IBD-like colitis, this proposal will address the following: (1) Elucidate the role of the microbiota in regulating
intestinal γδ T cell homeostasis during intestinal disease. 16S rRNA sequencing will be used to define shifts in
the microbial community in each mouse genotype. To determine if this microbiota is required and sufficient to
induce γδ T cell responses and disease we will treat animals with antibiotics and perform fecal microbiota
transfers into germ-free animals, respectively. (2) Determine the role of γδ T cells in driving IBD. Therapeutically,
I will treat mice with monoclonal antibodies that block γδ T cell receptor activation and monitor its impact on
inflammatory responses in the intestines and clinical disease development. In order to determine if γδ T cells
can confer disease, I will isolate γδ T cells from Stat3fl/flBatffl/flCd4Cre+ mice and transfer them into colitis
susceptible (Rag-/-) mice. The results of this proposal will further elucidate the role of γδ T cells in
Stat3fl/flBatffl/flCd4Cre+ mice, which may serve as useful model to study γδ T cells in IBD-like colitis. Given that
current therapies for IBD patients are only partially effective, the resulting data from this study and the
establishment of this unique mouse model of γδ T cells in IBD-like colitis will potentially identify novel therapeutic
targets to make a positive impact on the 6.8 million people living with IBD worldwide."

My postdoctoral studies focus on understanding how Borrelia burgdorferi, the causal agent of Lyme disease,
survives in nature—which involves studying its relationship with its natural mammalian reservoir host,
Peromyscus leucopus. While previous work has demonstrated that Ixodes scapularis ticks disproportionately
obtain B. burgdorferi (which can then be passed onto humans) by feeding on asymptomatic P. leucopus mice, it
remains unclear (a) why P. leucopus appear better suited than other small rodents to pass on B. burgdorferi, (b)
why P. leucopus remain asymptomatic despite chronic, systemic B. burgdorferi infection, and (c) what molecular
tools B. burgdorferi uses to successfully infect P. leucopus. Elucidating the natural ecology of B. burgdorferi
represents an important public health goal, as, while B. burgdorferi infection is typically treatable, a substantial
fraction of patients remains symptomatic for months to decades. Thus, finding mechanisms to prevent B.
burgdorferi infection is critical. The long-term goal of this project is to better understand the symbiotic
relationship between B. burgdorferi and P. leucopus to reveal targets for disrupting the enzootic cycle
and reducing the burden of Lyme disease.
This grant seeks to better understand the P. leucopus-B. burgdorferi host-microbe interaction by (a) performing
experimental work to monitor the dynamics of B. burgdorferi infection and P. leucopus inflammation change over
time, and (b) identify B. burgdorferi genes that are required for P. leucopus infection. For the first goal, I will
attempt to understand how bacterial burden in P. leucopus tissues correlates with histopathology, tick infectivity,
and changes in gene expression over time. This will involve performing the most comprehensive study of B.
burgdorferi infection in these rodents to date and will test a variety of hypotheses that have been postulated but
left untested in the field. To accomplish this, I will leverage digital-droplet PCR, RNA-sequencing, microscopic
histology analyses, and xenodiagnostic testing. Of note, I will simultaneously perform the same experiments in
two Mus musculus inbred lines (C57BL/6J and C3H/HeN, which develop mild and severe Lyme disease-like
symptoms, accordingly) to compare my findings against frequently used murine models. For the second aim, I
will deploy transposon sequencing screening using a mutant library that my lab has frequently utilized in past
publications. In sum, these experiments will dramatically improve our understanding of both the host and
pathogen factors that facilitate B. burgdorferi survival in nature. Additionally, this project is well-suited to promote
my long-term goal of starting an independent research program at an academic institution, as the datasets
generated in this study will serve as the foundation of my future laboratory."

Head and neck cancer (HNSCC) afflicts mostly men. Female patients who develop HNSCC tend to be
postmenopausal, with menopausal hormone therapy lowering their risk of developing the disease. We show that
premenopausal female HNSCC patients have an improved response to therapy including immunotherapy (IO).
Using clinical trial data, we show no difference in response to IO from testosterone. Similarly, our preclinical data
show no IO response effect from gonadal castration. But 0.1 mg estradiol (E2) improves response in castrated
male mice to that of female mice. Our overall objective is to understand how the premenopausal female hormone
E2 contributes to progression and treatment resistance. Our data show that E2 had no effect on cancer cell
viability, suggesting the tumor microenvironment (TME) as the site of action. E2 is known to play a major role in
autoimmunity and inflammation, where it modulates dendritic cell (DC) and regulatory T cells (Treg)
differentiation and function, and lymphatic vessel maturation. These immune cell populations regulate response
to immunotherapy in HNSCC, but how they are affected by sex hormones remains largely uncharacterized. Our
preclinical data also show that compared to male mice, females have increased DCs, less suppressive Tregs,
and respond better to immunotherapeutic strategies with enhanced Teff function. Such response is removed
with oophorectomy (OVX) but rescued with E2 of 0.1mg. OVX also changes the TME towards an
immunosuppressive one with enhanced immunosuppressive Treg activity, similar to that of male mice. Finally,
within the TME, OVX reduces the formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the TME and draining lymph
nodes (dLN), which enhance Teff cell priming and subsequent trafficking into the TME. We hypothesize that
the sexually dimorphic response is driven by E2 acting via its receptors on Tregs and DCs to enhance
antigen presentation and increase Teff activation, thus selectively determining response to
immunotherapy. We also hypothesize that E2 will increase homing and trafficking of antigen specific T
cells by enhancing HEV formation and maturation. In Aim1, we will interrogate the regulatory mechanisms
of E2's effects on the DC biology by using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMS), in vitro assays, and
proteomic analysis to examine receptor subtypes and molecular mediators of DC differentiation, maturation, and
antigen presentation. Aim 2 will dissect mechanisms of how E2's effect on Tregs can drive response and
selection of sex-specific immunotherapies. We will test this with GEMMS, mouse chimeras, and pharmacological
manipulation in in vivo and in vitro co-culture experiments, to identify signaling and downstream effectors.
Focusing on T cell trafficking in Aim 3, we will examine E2's effect on HEV formation, and T cell egress from the
dLN to the TME and systemic circulation using a combination of flow and immunofluorescence techniques in
GEMMs and in vitro systems. These studies will collectively elucidate the basic mechanisms for advancing sex-
directed novel biomarkers and therapeutics in HNSCC."

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease and is expected to become the second
leading cause of cancer-associated-death in the US by the year 2025. Of these cases, greater than 90% of
patients harbor a mutation to KRAS. Unfortunately, direct targeting of the mutations specific to PDAC have failed
to gain traction, but due to mutant KRAS’s ubiquity to the disease, alternative methods to reduce downstream
MAPK signaling have been investigated. Recently, targeting of the upstream regulator of KRAS activity, SHP2
has been brought to the forefront of the field. SHP2 is essential for the development of PDAC in mouse models,
despite mutant KRAS presence. However, while the role of SHP2 in PDAC has been largely attributed to its
regulation of the MAPK pathway, evidence in many other tissue types argue that SHP2 should be contributing
to tumor progression through other mechanisms – most notably, through regulation of intracellular calcium flux.
Our preliminary data shows that SHP2 interacts upstream of calcium flux with the enzyme phospholipase-c-
gamma-1 (PLCγ1). Recent literature has described the mechanism of this interaction as we have begun to define
the outcomes of disrupting the pairing and downstream calcium flux, providing evidence that uncouples the
canonically attributed role of SHP2 in PDAC from the MAPK pathway. Our probing of the metabolic functions of
SHP2 inhibited PDAC cells leads us to hypothesize that SHP2 and PLCγ1 interact to sustain calcium signaling
required for the activation of mitochondrial enzymes in the citric acid cycle. In this vein, we will take a two pronged
approach to investigating SHP2’s role in metabolism: first, by using the Agilent Seahorse Fuel-Flex testing we
can pinpoint the metabolic dependencies of SHP2 inhibited cells, and mechanisms of resistance to metabolic
stress; second, we will capture the steady state metabolite profile of PDAC cells in response to differential SHP2,
MEK, or PLCγ1 activity to take an untargeted approach to defining the metabolic implications of each protein’s
function individually and collectively. Additionally, we believe that the outcomes of this interaction are not limited
to changes in mitochondrial function. Therefore, we hypothesize that by comparing SHP2 inhibited and MEK
inhibited PDAC cells’ global changes to their phospho-proteome, we will be able to delineate the MAPK-
independent-functions of SHP2 as an oncogene in PDAC signaling. We expect the outcomes of this proposal to
highlight the importance of SHP2 in tumor progression/cancer cell signaling outside of the MAPK pathway, while
still appreciating its role in regulating KRAS activity. We believe that the conclusions of this study will yield a new
network of protein interactions to be investigated as targets in PDAC, eventually leading to development of
therapeutics for improved patient outcome."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide currently affecting over 50 million people.
The pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s dementia is complex and multifactorial, however, decreases in
cerebrovascular function have been linked to disease progression. Despite the role vascular health plays in the
prognosis of AD, the ability to assess intracranial vascular integrity is limited. There is a critical need to assess
vascular properties sensitive to microvascular function and arterial stiffness to understand why and how vascular
health is a substantial risk factor for AD dementia. The right tool will be able to assess multiple cerebrovascular
health metrics and monitor potential interventions targeting the vascular system in the treatment of AD dementia.
This study aims to utilize a conventional resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scan to assess arterial stiffness
and microvascular health through the development and implementation of specialized image processing
techniques. These metrics will be applied to two large datasets available from the Human Connectome Project
(HCP) – Aging and the Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (IADRC). Using the HCP dataset, we will
assess vascular changes in a typically aging sample (aims 1 & 2). With the IADRC dataset, we will assess the
associations of cerebrovascular health with cognitive function across a spectrum of cognitive impairment (aim
3). The central hypothesis is that measures sensitive to arterial stiffness and microvascular function
derived from specialized rs-fMRI image processing will significantly correlate with typical aging and
cognitive impairment in the spectrum of AD pathology. The central hypothesis will be tested with the
following aims:
 Aim 1: Assess the correlation of cerebral artery stiffness and age using rs-fMRI-derived arterial pulse
 propagation mapping.
 Aim 2: Evaluate rs-fMRI-derived cerebral transit time (CTT) in the HCP-aging dataset.
 Aim 3: Determine whether rs-fMRI-derived arterial stiffness and CTT in the AD-spectrum are significantly

The measures of arterial stiffness and microvascular function will provide greater insight into the influence of
vascular health on AD dementia and may be used in the future to monitor intervention status. The entire pipeline
with detailed demo code developed in this project will be openly shared to allow other researchers to extract
these vascular metrics from standard rs-fMRI data and study other pathologies with known cerebrovascular

Reading Outcomes in Children with Vestibular Loss
 Vestibular loss can co-occur with hearing loss causing dual sensory deficits. Unfortunately, children with
hearing loss are rarely assessed for vestibular loss. As a result, the impact of co-morbid vestibular loss in children
with hearing loss is unknown, particularly on academic and cognitive outcomes. While vestibular loss has been
speculated to affect reading outcomes in children (Braswell 2006a; Snashall 1983; Tomaz 2014), the extent to
which vestibular loss affects reading outcomes and the association between vestibular loss and reading is not
understood. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to investigate the relationship between reading outcomes
and vestibular loss in children with hearing loss. The vestibular system is responsible for decoding head
movement and eliciting eye movements in an equal and opposite direction to maintain steady vision. It is not
surprising therefore that vestibular loss results in reduced dynamic visual acuity – the ability to see clearly during
head movement – (Rine 2003; Janky 2015); however, children with vestibular loss and reduced dynamic visual
acuity also have reduced reading acuity – the smallest print size that can be read – and require larger print size
for reading compared to peers with normal hearing (Braswell 2006a). Thus, Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
vestibular loss results in visual acuity deficits due to vestibulo-ocular reflex and cognitive deficits, which could
impact reading. Theoretically, the Simple View of Reading (Gough 1986) suggests that reading comprehension
can be explained by decoding and language comprehension abilities; however, these two factors do not account
for all the variance in reading comprehension (Aaron 1999). In children with hearing loss, reading is affected by
language, phonological processing, and auditory access; however, these factors alone do not fully explain the
variance. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that after controlling for variables known to contribute to reading
performance (i.e., language, phonological processing, auditory access, etc.), vestibular loss will account for a
significant amount of the variance in reading outcomes. The long-term goals of this research program are to
define the developmental and academic impact of comorbid vestibular loss and then develop rehabilitative
strategies that mitigate negative outcomes. The proposed work will provide a better understanding of vestibular
loss as a contributing factor to reading difficulties for children with hearing loss, where previously only the effects
of hearing loss have been considered. The proposed work will improve the scientific understanding of reading
deficits in children with hearing loss and could lead to new rehabilitative interventions for reading in children with
hearing loss by considering vestibular loss, a factor that has until now been ignored. A scaffolded training plan
has been devised to enhance my understanding of literacy outcomes in children with hearing loss, cognition,
neuroanatomy, development, and the ability to incorporate eye tracking to address the hypotheses."

 The lumbar intervertebral discs naturally degenerate with age and are implicated in low back pain, the
world’s leading cause of disability. Because the discs are avascular, cells residing in the central disc are up to
6-8 mm from the nearest blood vessel in adults. To maintain homeostasis, disc cells rely on diffusion and
convection between the discs and adjacent vertebrae for nutrient transport and waste removal. When transport
is compromised, local glucose and oxygen concentrations decrease, pH decreases, and cell viability and
matrix turnover are impacted. Currently, there are no clinical strategies to intervene in age-related
degeneration, but improving fluid transport may be one strategy to slow or reverse the process.
 Previous work in animals instrumented with external loading devices suggests that dynamic loading
increases the rate of solutes transported into the discs and causes disc anabolism. One way to induce loading
in vivo is through exercise and running exercise was recently related to improved disc health in animals and
humans. Still, it is not clear how in vivo loading modulates fluid and nutrient transport and which exercise
protocols induce the appropriate dynamic loads. Exercise dosing is likely an important factor, however there is
a “complete lack of studies in the exercise and pain literature testing multiple doses of exercise in a single
patient (or control) group”. The objective of this work is to identify factors that affect fluid and nutrient
transport and implement an exercise protocol that optimizes transport for disc regeneration.
 In Aim 1, rats of young, adult, and advanced ages will be evaluated for differences in exercise-induced
disc fluid transport and factors related to fluid transport (cartilage endplate porosity, disc deformations during
activity) as well as exercise-induced cellular glucose uptake and factors that affect glucose uptake (cell
membrane transporters). In Aim 2, rats of young and advanced ages will be evaluated while executing one of
6 8-week treadmill programs of varying intensity for changes in disc function, composition, structure, and pain.
In Aim 3, rats with surgically-induced degeneration will be evaluated while executing an 8-week treadmill
program for changes in disc function, composition, structure, and pain. There will be two control groups to
determine the specific impact of exercise-induced loading.
 My goal is to develop a translational pipeline to test and iterate disc regeneration strategies in
animals and seamlessly import those into humans. The results from this study will identify exercise
protocols that maximize disc fluid transport, glucose uptake, and disc health and can be translated to humans
for disc regeneration."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) continues to impose a tremendous burden on society and efficacious treatment
options are severely lacking. Recently, epigenetic processes such as histone acetylation emerged as potential
contributors to AUD. Acetylation of histones has been shown to facilitate DNA accessibility and gene expression.
The dynamic and reversible nature of this process makes it a particularly promising potential therapeutic target.
 Novel evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is dependent on metabolic state, implicating specific
metabolic factors in neural functions that drive behavior (Li*, Egervari* et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2018).
Recently, our group has shown that neuronal histone acetylation is fueled by the metabolite acetyl-CoA that is
produced from acetate by nuclear Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 (ACSS2; Mews et al, Nature 2017). As a major
biological source of acetate is alcohol metabolism, I hypothesized that alcohol-derived acetate might have
profound effects on the epigenetic landscape in the brain following binge drinking. Using heavy isotope labeling
in mice, I showed that alcohol metabolism rapidly promotes histone acetylation in the brain by direct deposition
of alcohol-derived acetyl groups onto histones in an ACSS2-dependent manner. I observed similar incorporation
of alcohol-derived acetate into fetal brain, suggesting a potential role for ACSS2 during prenatal alcohol
exposure. In adult mice, alcohol-induced histone acetylation led to increased expression of key neuronal genes
linked to learning and memory. Strikingly, ACSS2 was required for ethanol-induced associative learning, which
underlies craving and relapse after protracted periods of abstinence (Mews*, Egervari*# et al, Nature, 2019).
These preliminary findings establish a direct and dynamic link between peripheral and central alcohol metabolism
and brain histone acetylation with significant therapeutic potential.
 In this proposal, I will aim to (1) determine the importance of ACSS2 in voluntary alcohol intake and test
whether ACSS2 inhibition decreases alcohol consumption in mice; (2) characterize the role of ACSS2 in prenatal
alcohol exposure and in the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; and (3) explore the potential
relevance of this novel pathway in various brain regions that regulate different aspects of AUD. This study will
make pioneering contributions to our understanding of alcohol’s effects on the brain with respect to epigenetic
and metabolic processes, and has the potential to identify new pharmaceutical targets to ameliorate alcohol use
disorder. In addition, the proposed training and research will greatly facilitate my transition to an independent
tenured-track faculty position. I will learn a combination of computational, genomic and proteomic techniques
and behavioral approaches that will help establish my niche and provide me with the skills necessary to work at
the intersection of epigenetics, metabolism and alcohol neurobiology. With the acquisition of valuable skills that
I describe in the training plan of this proposal, I will be in a unique position to reveal new insights into the role of
epigenetic-metabolic regulation of brain function in the context of alcohol use."

The proposed renewal application for African Cancer Leaders Institute (ACLI) is a “meeting within a meeting”
designed to coincide with conferences organized by the African Organization for Research Training In Cancer
(AORTIC) conference, beginning with the forthcoming, “Cancer in Africa: Implementation, Workforce, and
Opportunities” in Dakar, Senegal, November 3-8, 2023.The ACLI will identify early career researchers, especially
women and individuals underrepresented in global cancer research who are capable of leading interdisciplinary
teams to improve cancer treatment in Africa. The long-term goal of the ACLI is to provide an intellectually
stimulating platform to propel emerging global cancer leaders from Africa and the US to receive support for
innovative cancer research in Africa, and to stimulate an African network for emerging leaders in cancer
research. The ACLI platform will have annual goals and objectives set by the Education and Research Sub-
Committees of AORTIC in collaboration with the ACLI program Organizers. The ACLI will widely solicit
competitive applications from aspiring leaders in Africa and the US. During the past funding cycle, three cohorts
of ACLI participants (60 total) were recruited and participated in AORTIC Conferences in Durban in 2017, Maputo
in 2019 and Senegal in 2022 during a mini-retreat for ACLI members and AORTIC Council Members at the 1st
African Regional Cancer Conference (ARCC) planned and hosted by AORTIC Leadership in West Africa.
Awardees from all cohorts were invited to participate and 21 attended in person. It was gratifying to note
enthusiastic participation by investigators from West Africa, especially those from French and Portuguese
speaking countries. Most of the ARCC lectures were given by ACLI participants and researchers working in
Africa who reported having received 6 NIH and 5 foundation grants. ACLI participants were unanimous in
endorsing the need for a regional conference every other year that will provide greater capacity building
opportunities and more succinct leadership programing for ACLI. For this renewal application, 10 Emerging
Leaders will be fully-funded for travel to attend the AORTIC conference and participate in ACLI activities.
Five emerging Leaders from high-income countries with meritorious abstracts and application will be
selected for Merit travel award in order to continue to forge professional relationships and foster peer
mentorship. ACLI participants will mostly network in groups of 6-8 with conversations on specific topics
facilitated by Faculty and attend scientific sessions. For peer mentoring, sessions will be arranged for ACLI
participants to discuss and evaluate concepts presented at the conference to enhance learning and career
development experience. Each new ACLI participant will be asked to prepare a brief 15-minute overview of
career accomplishments and plans for their career development activities. We will continue to track a number of
metrics including conference evaluations, career landmarks, publication records and the number of ACLI
members who compete successfully for Africa focused NIH/NCI grants e.g K43, K07, K23, R21 etc."

Tobacco use remains at alarming high rates amongst individuals with serious mental illness, such as
schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and recurring depressive disorders. Smoking tobacco is the number one
preventable cause of death in this population, shortening the lifespan of adults with serious mental illness by
25 years and contributing to $317 billion in healthcare expenditures and indirect loss of earnings and disability
benefits. Novel and effective models to deliver wider-reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals
with serious mental illness are highly needed and indicated as a priority for NIH. Mobile apps are a promising
method to deliver smoking cessation treatments to people with serious mental illness. Despite numerous apps
available to use for people with serious mental illness, our feasibility research has demonstrated that using
these apps presents daunting challenges for this population. Based on this work, we developed Learn to Quit,
a user-centered smoking cessation app tailored to the needs of individuals with serious mental illness. The
app’s main active ingredient is a novel behavioral treatment that has shown promise as a smoking cessation
intervention -- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The app provides education about the use of nicotine
replacement therapy and recommendations from US Clinical Practice Guidelines to ensure alignment with best
clinical practices. In a recent pilot randomized controlled trial (R00 DA037276), comparing Learn to Quit versus
NCI’s QuitGuide, we demonstrated: (1) high recruitment and retention rates, (2) high levels of user
engagement with Learn to Quit, (3) an effective method to conduct a large multi-site randomized controlled
trial, and (4) promising cessation outcomes. While this developmental work provides initial evidence of Learn to
Quit’s usability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy, a large scale randomized controlled trial is needed to test
its efficacy in a representative sample of patients with serious mental illness. Therefore, the proposed study
will: (1) employ a randomized parallel arm design to compare the efficacy of Learn to Quit vs. NCI’s QuitGuide,
(2) use rigorous methods to evaluate mediators of app engagement and app efficacy, and (3) examine the
cost-effectiveness of Learn to Quit compared to a non-tailored app designed for the general population. The
study addresses a serious problem -- high smoking rates among people with serious mental illness -- and
proposes to test the efficacy of an easily-accessible smoking cessation intervention, using technology with the
potential for high population-level reach."

Polycomb group (PcG) complexes are multi-protein, evolutionarily conserved epigenetic machineries that
regulate stem cell fate decisions and early development. Mutation and abnormal expression of Polycomb
Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) subunits are also implicated in human disease. PRC1 is a protein complex that
was classically thought to mediate transcriptional repression of genes. We and others recently showed that
specific PRC1 complexes, defined by the presence of one of the six mammalian PCGF paralogs, can also
facilitate gene transcription in stem and cancer cells to regulate cell fate decisions and oncogenes. How PRC1
is recruited to chromatin and mediates transcriptional activation is poorly understood. We recently demonstrated
that PRC1 and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) co-occupy transcriptionally active genes and enhancers to
regulate proliferation of breast cancer cells. ER is functionally activated by the steroid hormone estrogen. Once
activated, ER binds to chromatin and recruits co-activators to regulate fundamental biological processes such
as development, reproduction, metabolism, and cancer. Our new preliminary data show that estrogen induces
rapid and dynamic recruitment to chromatin of RING1B, the core subunit of all PRC1 complexes, to activate
gene transcription in a PRC1-indepenent fashion. Moreover, we found that R-loop formation and ER might be
important for RING1B recruitment to chromatin, suggesting that RING1B is tethered to chromatin by different
mechanisms. Importantly, RING1B is also required for ER recruitment, gene and enhancer transcriptional
activation as well as chromatin organization. Our preliminary 3D chromatin architecture data also revealed that
RING1B/ER-containing enhancers physically interact with estrogen-responsive genes. These results uncover
potential new mechanisms for transcriptional activation mediated by RING1B upon estrogen administration.
Finally, we found that RING1B is overexpressed in metastatic endocrine resistant breast cancer and that
endocrine resistant cells are addicted to RING1B. We hypothesize that RING1B is a novel epigenetic regulator
of estrogen-mediated gene regulation and chromatin architecture, and that RING1B depletion and chemical
inhibition will decrease metastatic endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Here, we propose: to determine how
RING1B is recruited to estrogen-responsive genes (Aim 1), the role of RING1B in enhancer-promoter
interactions during estrogen administration (Aim 2), and the role of RING1B in endocrine resistance (Aim 3). Hi-
C experiments, coupled to genome-wide studies (including gene expression profiles, chromatin accessibility
assays), proteomics, and xenografts and PDX models will be used to address these central questions.
Fundamentally, these findings will expand our understanding of the estrogen response and Polycomb implicated
in broad biological processes including development, cellular metabolism and cancer."

 The development of serial confocal and electron-microscopy (EM), and automated image
segmentation have allowed us to elucidate some of the structural details of the cortical circuit at the
cellular and synaptic level. This information is critical because there is a close link between the
morphological properties of circuits in different brain areas and their function. It is broadly accepted that
the canonical microcircuit of the cortex is a repeating motif across cortex. Once the structure and
function in the local motif is understood this could be applied across all of cortex. However, recently it
has been shown that there are major laminar, areal and species differences that need to be taken into
account by this model. Another important feature of the canonical circuit in sensory areas is that the
initial thalamocortical (TC) driving input to layer 4 in cortex, which was presumed to be weak, needs to
be massively amplified to obtain the observed rates of spiking. However, recent studies have shown
that the weak TC assumption, has underestimated the TC strength by 2-4 times. I hypothesis that,
although the canonical circuit may provide general framework for cortical circuit functioning, diverse
sensory brain areas have major laminar differences in their neuronal and synaptic distributions. These
differences will, in turn, reflect the diverse processing roles and capabilities of the brain areas. To test
this hypothesis I will examine three primary sensory areas in macaque monkey cortex using Focused
Ion Beam/Scanning EM to determine detailed synaptic connectivity, using high-resolution confocal
microscopy to provide large scale determination of specific synaptic connectivity, and using mid-
resolution confocal microscopy to determine global cell type distributions in specific brain regions. If, as
I hypothesize, there are major quantitative differences between areas that will reflect their diverse
processing roles and capabilities, this will call for a refinement of the concept of the canonical circuit.
These quantitative results are important to build realistic population based spiking models of cortex that
can reproduce many of the detailed functional characteristics that are found in the brain. They are also
important because understanding the basic cortical organization of the normal brain is essential, as it
provides the standard against which it can be judged which processes can be seen to be altered or
damaged in disorders that affect the cerebral cortex. Additionally, an important part of this project is my
professional development as a PI. As such, I have established a research enhancement plan to
increase my research scholarship and publications, with the final goal of acquiring non-SCORE
research support."

Health care disparities and inequities are national problems. To build the next generation of clinician
scientists to advance health equity and reduce disparities, it is critical to provide clinical and research
training through the lens of health equity. Healthcare equity concerns need to be addressed through the
providers’ engagement in real-world patient care environments. The development of patient-based
research network (PBRN) activities within clinical dental educational care programs offers the potential
for meaningful research as well as building a culture supporting a broader and more diverse cohort of
future practitioners to participate in community based PBRNs with greater capacity for equity
considerations in both their practice and research activities. To build this future capacity, the University
of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) and the Howard University (HU) are partnered with the shared goals to
foster a culture of scientific inquiry and collaboration within our clinical dental education environments
with scientific partnerships defined by shared strengths and synergies across institutions, to build
foundational educational experiences in clinical practice-based research that encourage a more
energized, diverse, and inclusive clinician scientist/practitioner, and to collect specific data examining
the effects of racial bias on clinical care in our two academic oral health centers. To achieve these goals,
we will integrate four programmatic components: 1) To establish program-specific educational pathways
in clinical and practice-based research for students and faculty that include an understanding of
healthcare disparities and equity awareness among providers. 2) To utilize inter-institutional strengths
to build collaborative engagement opportunities through programmatic guidance, education, mentoring,
and school-based practice research activities. 3) To develop inter-institutional mentoring partnerships
between HU and the UMB faculty and students that foster bidirectional engagement (collaboration). 4)
To develop a PBRN study providing clinical practice-based research experiences examining
associations of racial bias with provision of dental care that align with student and faculty experiences
and training in this program. Our study hypothesis is that racial biases negatively impact care delivery
for Black (vs. White) patients in academic dental clinical settings. The practice-based research project
proposed will examine the associations between implicit/explicit biases among dental student and
resident providers with delivery of care metrics across diverse, underserved patient populations in two
urban dental schools, UMB and HU. Successful completion of the project will address the health
disparities and expand the reach of PBRN through dental education care programs."

Why patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) continue to suffer from chronic bacterial infections despite
new medications that improve CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function is not
known. The long-term goal is to develop therapeutics that modulate host immune responses
in CF patients to mitigate chronic infection and inflammation. The objective of this proposal is to
define how CFTR regulates macrophage function. The rationale underlying this proposal is that
our prior work demonstrates that CF macrophages are integral to the inability of patients with
CF to clear bacterial infections through failed NADPH oxidase (NOX) assembly and reduced
autophagy. The central hypothesis is that loss of functional CFTR in human MΦs inhibits NOX
assembly and subsequent ROS-mediated autophagy, independent of CFTR mutation class, but
worsened by specific opportunistic bacteria. Further, we expect that a critical threshold of CFTR
function is needed to reverse the NOX assembly/autophagy deficits and can be re-established
by CFTR modulators combined with alternative CFTR restoration agents such as cysteamine or
our novel autophagy stimulator, AR-13. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Define the mechanism by which CFTR regulates MΦ NOX assembly; 2)
Determine how CF specific pathogens differentially regulate MΦ ROS production; 3) Determine
the extent to which novel therapeutic approaches alter the MΦ NOX/autophagy axis. We will
pursue these aims using an innovative combination of genetic and pharmacologic techniques in
human macrophages. The proposed research is significant because a precise understanding
of how CF macrophage function is regulated would allow novel antibiotic- and CFTR mutation-
agnostic treatment approaches to infection. It is also significant because it will determine if
specific pathogens independently contribute to deficits in macrophage-mediated bacterial killing.
The expected outcome of this work will establish a mechanistic framework to enable us to
target and correct defective CF MΦ-mediated bacterial killing. Ultimately, we will translate this
new knowledge into a new treatment paradigm that uses innovative host-directed therapies to
combat bacterial infections."

Isoprenoids represent a diverse class of compounds with a broad range of applications in medicine and industry.
Their extraction from natural sources is both challenging and potentially harmful to the environment, while the
enormous structural complexity of many isoprenoids makes traditional chemical synthesis nontrivial. Modern
metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches have overcome some of these difficulties, but issues
related to metabolic flux and the limited availability of the universal isoprenoid precursors complicate their
widespread implementation. The artificial pathways developed thus far have been solely focused on synthesizing
dimethylallyl and isopentenyl diphosphates and require additional enzymes for the generation of polyprenyl-
diphosphates (polyprenyl-PPs). Thus, the primary objective of this proposal is to develop an efficient strategy for
the synthesis of both natural and unnatural (poly)prenyl-PPs for downstream applications. This will be achieved
using two complementary methods: i) employing undecaprenol kinases and isopentenyl phosphate kinases; and
ii) employing hydroxyethylthiazole kinase, isopentenyl phosphate kinases, and farnesyl diphosphate synthase.
Additionally, the two methods will work in conjunction with isoprenoid methylatransferases to incorporate
additional diversity into the polyprenyl-PPs. The proposed studies include: i) structural and functional assessment
of selected enzymes, ii) catalyst engineering, and iii) optimization of coupled in vitro and in vivo platforms for
the generation of diversified libraries of select natural products. We expect these studies to generate: i) rules and
concepts to advance knowledge on structure-activity relationships in selected classes of enzymes; ii) an optimized,
enzyme-coupled platform to generate diversified substrates and isoprenoids; and iii) novel isoprenoid analogs
with potential therapeutic applications. Thus, the proposed work will offer unprecedented access to uniquely
bioactive isoprenoid libraries not readily accessible via traditional methods, and it stands to deepen our
fundamental understanding of four enzyme classes while also developing them into useful biocatalysts."

Potential roles of neutrophils and platelets in the pathophysiology of intracranial aneurysms have been long
suggested by clinical observations. However, the exact mechanism by which neutrophils and platelets work to
promote the rupture of intracranial aneurysms is not well understood. Activated neutrophils can release
decondensed DNA decorated with neutrophil enzymes such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase,
resulting in the formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and the death of neutrophils (NETosis).
NETs were originally described as a structure that can trap and dissolve pathogens. However, recent studies
suggest roles of NETs in sterile diseases that involve vascular inflammation including atherosclerosis,
vasculitis, and venous thrombosis. Interactions between NETs and platelets may result in a vicious cycle of
NET formation and platelet activation that leads to the excessive vascular wall damages and aneurysmal
rupture. Our preliminary studies show that NETs exist in both human intracranial aneurysms and experimental
mouse aneurysms. In addition, mice lacking protein arginine deiminases-4 (PAD4), an enzyme required for the
NET formation, had a reduced rupture rate.
We hypothesize that NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps, can promote the development of intracranial
aneurysm rupture through the vicious cycle of neutrophil and platelet activation. In Aim 1, we will test neutrophil
PAD4-deficient mice have a lower rupture rate and reduce NET formations compared to the control mice. In
Aim 2, we will test whether the pharmacological prevention of NET formation by PAD4 inhibitors (Cl-amidine
and GSK484) or the resolution of NETs by deoxyribonuclease reduces aneurysmal rupture. In Aim 3, we will
test whether platelets and neutrophil-platelet interactions contribute to aneurysmal rupture. We will test
whether thrombocytopenic mice have reduced NET formations and lower rupture rates. We will also study the
contribution of P-selectin or CD11b/CD18-mediated neutrophil-platelet interactions to the development of
aneurysmal rupture.
The proposed studies will provide new insights into the roles of NETs and their interactions with platelets in the
development of aneurysmal rupture. The results will be a basis for future studies to develop new therapies that
target NETs and platelet-neutrophil interactions for the prevention of aneurysmal rupture."

 Chronic intrauterine hypoxia is common amongst not only the 140 million people in the
world living at high altitudes but also in many complications of pregnancy such as preeclampsia,
cigarette smoking, and placental insufficiency. Adaptation of the fetus to chronic hypoxia results
in many adverse developmental outcomes, including pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
The BKCa channel is critical to the relaxation of the pulmonary vasculature of the newborn at
birth. Recent results from our well-established fetal lamb model of chronic hypoxia during
pregnancy points to BKCa channel dysfunction as a causal factor in pulmonary hypertension. The
work in this proposal will investigate the mechanistic link between cellular hypoxia and BKCa
channel dysfunction. Recent work by others indicates that the ‘master hypoxamir’ miR210, a
micro-RNA that is upregulated by HIF-1?, orchestrates pulmonary hypertension by suppressing
translation of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein ISCU. The resulting lack of iron-sulfur
clusters results in mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that chronic intrauterine hypoxia
leads to pulmonary hypertension by activation of the HIF-1? → miR210 → ISCU axis,
resulting in increased mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species that lead to BKCa channel
dysfunction.
 We propose three specific aims. Each specific aim is designed to integrate in vitro and in
vivo approaches in order to better ascertain the relevance of the in vitro results to pulmonary
function of the intact animal. Aim 1 will focus on determining the mechanism underlying BKCa
channel dysfunction, and on establishing whether loss of BKCa channel function alone is
adequate to result in pulmonary hypertension in intact lambs. Aim 2 will focus on the effects of
hypoxia-induced increases in miR210 on ISCU activity, iron-sulfur cluster levels, and
mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species production. In intact lambs, we will
establish whether activation of this pathway in the absence of hypoxia results in pulmonary
hypertension, and whether suppression of this pathway in the presence of hypoxia prevents BKCa
channel function and pulmonary hypertension. Aim 3 will investigate whether the increased
reactive oxygen species levels in response to chronic hypoxia play a causative role in BKCa
channel function and pulmonary hypertension. Using both in vitro and in vivo methods, we will
determine whether the global antioxidant Vitamin C or mitochondria-specific antioxidant MitoQ
will prevent pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic intrauterine hypoxia."

 Cerebral vessel-associated astrocyte end-feet play an important role in formation and
maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and regulation of neurovascular coupling and
cerebral blood flow (CBF). Ischemic stroke causes structural and biochemical changes of the
perivascular astrocytes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and subsequent impact on
cerebral vessel damage/repair are not well understood. Previously, we show that in response to
ischemia and hypoxia, reactive astrocytes stimulate Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 protein (NHE1)
activity to counteract the acidic pHi. This leads to intracellular Na+ overload, astrocytic swelling,
and impaired glutamate uptake, which aggravates ischemic brain damage. Our recent study
shows that selective deletion of Nhe1 in astrocytes (Astro-KO) abolished ischemic stroke-
mediated astrogliosis, preserved BBB function, and reduced cerebral vessel damage in a
mouse model of focal ischemic stroke (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion). Despite the
neuroprotective effects conferred by astrocytic Nhe1 deletion in ischemic brains, the precise
molecular mechanisms involved in the process are not completely understood. Our preliminary
study reveals that Wnt signaling pathway genes are the most significantly upregulated genes in
Nhe1 Astro-KO ischemic brains. Most importantly, targeted deletion of Nhe1 in Astro-KO mice
caused elevation of Wnt 7a/b and −catenin protein, accompanied with increased expression of
tight junction protein (TJ) and preservation of TJ structures in the blood vessels after ischemic
stroke. These new findings led us to hypothesize that deletion of astrocytic Nhe1 promotes
ischemic tissue repair by Wnt/−catenin mediated signaling mechanisms. We will investigate
that increased Wnt7a/b gene expression in Nhe1 Astro-KO mice leads to 1) increased
Wnt/−catenin signaling in vascular endothelial cells, 2) improves the BBB structural and
functional integrity, and 3) promotes vascular recovery by angiogenesis and restore of the
cerebral flow regulation after ischemic stroke. Completion of three specific aims will generate
new knowledge and identify novel therapeutic agents for promoting vascular repairs after
ischemic stroke."

 A greater understanding of the networks capable of suppressing seizures, including those remote from
the seizure focus, may be an important avenue towards developing needed new therapies for the epilepsies.
Prior work, funded by a K99/R00, found that on-demand optogenetic manipulation of the cerebellar cortex was
able to robustly inhibit hippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, with the greatest
benefits occurring through modulation of the midline cerebellum (vermis).
 Key areas of investigation arise from this prior work: 1) Does this observed functional connectivity
extend to healthy, non-epileptic animals? What regions and cell-types in the hippocampus are impacted by
cerebellar modulation, and what pathways mediates the observed functional connectivity? 2) How does
cerebellar-directed intervention lead to seizure inhibition? Specifically, what form of modulation is required of
the cerebellar nuclei? What pathways ultimately mediates successful seizure inhibition? 3) How can we make
this information (that optogenetic cerebellar modulation can inhibit temporal lobe seizures) more directly
translatable? Specifically, can electrical stimulation of the cerebellum be done in such a way as to also
robustly inhibit seizures? What stimulation parameters are critical for success? Can electrical stimulation be
successful when targeted to the cerebellar cortex? To the nuclei? Does the timing (i.e. on-demand) of
intervention matter? Can we improve outcomes through cerebellar targeted interventions? Answering these
questions improve translatability of previous findings and opens the door to novel intervention strategies.
 We find that cerebellar modulation of the hippocampus is not limited to seizure suppression, and
somewhat surprisingly, preliminary data indicates that there is a preferential impact on the CA1 region,
including an increase in activity of inhibitory interneurons. Additional preliminary data suggests that
optogenetic excitation, but not inhibition, of the fastigial nucleus provides seizure control. This allows us to
explore further downstream, including fastigial inputs to the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, tracing the
functional connectivity pathway. Importantly, we are also finding that electrical, rather than optical, intervention
targeting the cerebellar cortex is able to inhibit seizures, but, as hypothesized, that the stimulation parameters
used are critical for success. Successful identification of appropriate parameters is achievable through
Bayesian Parameter Optimization, which allows a rational, data driven, closed-loop approach to parameter
exploration. Taken together, the proposed experiments will provide important insight not only into cerebellar-
hippocampal interactions, but also thereby networks capable of seizure suppression, and how to effectively
target those networks using the clinically available tool of electrical stimulation."

There is substantial interest in gene editing as a means to treat human genetic disorders such as sickle cell
disease (SCD). Much effort has been focused on targeted nucleases such as CRISPR/Cas9, since site-directed
DNA damage strongly promotes homologous recombination (HR). However, clinical application of targeted
nucleases is challenged by the risk of off-target cleavage in the genome, which can lead to carcinogenesis. As
an alternative, we have shown that chemically modified triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (TFPs) and donor
DNAs (containing corrected base) delivered intravenously (IV) via poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)
nanoparticles into a mouse model of human β-thalassemia produced almost complete amelioration of the
disease, with clinically relevant β-globin gene correction frequencies in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of up
to 7%. TFPs can bind to duplex DNA in a sequence-specific manner and thereby stimulate DNA repair and
recombination. The mice showed alleviation of anemia, improvement in RBC morphologies, and reversal of
splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis with extremely low off-target effects in the genome compared
to nuclease-based approaches, a key advantage of this technology. The other key advantage is that the
components can be synthesized chemically and formulated into nanoparticles for simple IV administration. In
the proposed work, we will test whether the same technology can be applied with the same efficiency for codon
6 of the β-globin gene, the site of the sickle cell disease mutation. Herein, our central hypothesis is to establish
the feasibility of a new minimally invasive and innovative therapeutic paradigm for sickle cell disease: application
of further advances in nucleic acid chemistry and nanoparticle technology for the site-directed editing of SCD
mutation in the β-globin gene in vivo by facile IV infusion with high efficiency and low toxicity. This project will
eventually help translate gene therapies for SCD to clinical practice through advances in nucleic acid chemistry
and drug delivery. We will pursue Aim 1) Development of new generation chemically modified PNAs to boost
gene editing at the SCD mutation site. The efficacy of the approach will be evaluated in a sickle cell disease
mouse model. We will also explore the mechanism of PNA based gene editing. In Aim 2) Identify novel
nanotherapeutics based strategies to deliver reagent to HSCs by enabling penetrance into the bone marrow
following simple IV infusion of NP. This work will lay the foundation for a novel gene editing therapy for SCD that
has a high efficiency and much lower risk of off-target effects compared to existing nuclease based approaches."
10747885,"Acute pancreatitis (AP), an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, is the most common gastrointestinal condition
requiring hospitalization in the United States resulting in 275,000 hospital admissions annually. While many
suffer only mild illness, some progress to severe AP characterized by multisystem organ failure and death. Intact
immunity is vital for tissue protection and recovery from AP and data suggests that imbalance in pro and anti-
inflammatory cytokines may underlie progression of disease. Evidence exists of communication between
immune and epithelial cells in the pancreatic microenvironment but its role in AP remains understudied and
further understating is needed to identify potential therapies aimed at enhancing organ repair. Interleukin-22
(IL22) has emerged as an important cytokine in host defense and tissue repair within the gastrointestinal tract
and is often active in areas of inflammation. Previous studies and our own data have shown that IL22 signaling
reduces tissue damage during AP by mechanisms related to autophagy. IL22 binding protein (IL22BP), a soluble
neutralizing receptor, suppresses IL22 activity, and functions to maintain homeostasis. Only recently discovered,
it is released from dendritic cells (DC) in response to retinoic acid stimulation and binds to IL22 with very high
affinity. Induction of AP in mice using the cholecystokinin analogue cerulein results in a significant drop in IL22BP,
suggesting it may serve as an adaptive response to tissue injury, enhancing protective IL22 signaling. Further
supporting this is the markedly reduced pancreatic damage in transgenic mice lacking IL22BP given similar
doses of cerulein. The goal of this proposal is to improve our understand of how IL22 signaling is regulated in
AP through changes in expression of IL22BP. This is important as we have previously demonstrated that
continued overexpression of IL22 is associated with malignant transformation in the pancreas. Our central
hypothesis is that tissue injury in AP leads to an adaptive decrease in IL22BP which results from changes in RA
metabolism. A return of IL22BP expression after recovery results in homeostatic suppression of IL22 signaling.
We will test this hypothesis using transgenic mouse models and serum samples from a human AP cohort.
Specific aim 1 will determine the mechanisms underlying the observed decreased tissue damage experienced
by IL22BP-/- mice subjected to AP. We will explore changes in IL22 signaling, particularly related to autophagy
and enhancement of genes involved in regeneration. Based on preliminary data that a key RA producing enzyme,
ALDH1A1, is markedly reduced in AP, specific aim 2 will further characterize retinoic acid metabolism in the
pancreas during injury and recovery. This will include in vivo studies using pharmacologic measures to inhibit
RA anabolism with the goal of further reducing IL22BP production. Specific aim 3 will explore the crosstalk
between acinar and immune cells and the role of autocrine and paracrine signaling of RA in DC production of
IL22BP. Use of RA receptor blockade will be explored as a clinically relevant method to further reduce the
adaptive decrease in IL22BP during AP, enhancing tissue recovery and preventing progression to severe AP."
10747886,"Malignant gliomas encompass a diverse set of diseases, including pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas.
Recent genomic profiling techniques have advanced our understanding of these tumors by identifying molecular
subtypes and recurrent mutations, yet treatment options remain limited. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is
commonly cited as a major factor in treatment resistance since the majority of drugs and small molecules display
limited BBB penetration. Advancing our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate
brain tumor BBB function will be crucial to improve treatment strategies and outcomes for patients. Our recent
work demonstrated that BBB integrity can be dictated by brain tumor subtype specific mutations. In preliminary
studies using diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and cortical high-grade glioma (HGG) mouse models we
have created by in utero electroporation (IUE), we identified differences in Angiopoietin1 (Angpt1) expression, a
high affinity agonist of the endothelial Tie2 receptor. The Angpt1-Tie2 signaling axis plays a key role in vascular
response to injury, but its endogenous expression and function in brain tumors not been thoroughly evaluated.
Preliminary data in human tumors and mouse models reveal Angpt1 expression is elevated in glial brain tumors,
and displays differences within glioma subtypes. These differences mirror Angpt1 expression patterns we have
found in normal brain development, suggesting expression in gliomas may be linked in part to cell state programs
or upstream signaling pathways that promote particular cell states. Initial experiments in IUE DIPG mouse
models have shown that overexpression of the Tie2 antagonist Angpt2, or knockout of Angpt1, result in vascular
alterations. These findings form the basis of our hypothesis that Angpt1 is differentially expressed in gliomas,
and that its endogenous expression participates in regulating high-grade glioma blood-brain barrier integrity. To
test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (1) Define the expression and function of Angpt1 in high-
grade glioma blood-brain barrier integrity. In this aim we will (1A) determine the cellular expression pattern of
Angpt1 within gliomas, (1B,C) perform a detailed analysis of BBB, vascular phenotype and transcriptional
signatures to determine the role of endogenous Angpt1 in glioma BBB integrity, and (1D) assess how differences
in endogenous Angpt1 expression between glioma subtypes impacts current therapeutic strategies that target
this signaling axis. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms that regulate Angpt1 expression. We will examine the
influence of cell lineage states and upstream signaling determinants, along with applying unbiased genome level
screens to define regulators of Angpt1. The proposed set of experiments will significantly improve our
understanding of how brain tumors regulate BBB integrity, and the dynamic interactions that occur between brain
tumor cells and their microenvironment. Taken together, the results and tools generated will yield new insights
into the expression and function of Angpt1, with broader implications relevant to other brain cancers and
neurological disorders that involve vascular alterations and BBB dysfunction."

With the development of triple combination antiretroviral therapy, routine HIV treatment eliminates nearly all
actively infected cells. Nevertheless, the small reservoir of latently infected cells, which can remain dormant for
long periods of time before becoming active and producing new virus particles, represents a crucial barrier to
completely curing the disease. Identifying markers that identify latently infected cells or the biochemical factors
that control latency activation could enable the effective use of a “shock and kill” strategy, where specific targeting
or activation of latently infected cells eliminates the viral reservoir. Our recent work suggests that the global
transcriptomic and epigenomic changes during hematopoietic differentiation affect viral latency and activation.
Additionally, we recently found that global inhibition of histone deacetylase activity increases viral activation in
these cells, further implicating epigenomic changes in activation. These results raise fundamental questions:
What are the markers of latently infected cells? How do the transcriptomic and epigenomic state of a cell affect
latency and activation? How does differentiation state relate to viral latency? Here, we leverage our experimental
platform for identifying latently and actively infected cells, single cell transcriptome and epigenome sequencing,
and our recently developed computational integration methods to investigate these questions. Our
interdisciplinary team combines expertise in HIV basic science, HIV clinical treatment, and bioinformatics to
develop an experimental and computational framework for integrated gene expression, chromatin accessibility,
and lineage into a single picture of viral latency and activation. Specifically, this project will (1) use single-cell
RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq to map diversity of infected cells, (2) investigate the relationship between
hematopoietic differentiation state and viral activation, (3) determine viral integration sites through single-cell
RNA-seq, (4) computationally integrate single cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles, and (5) computationally
infer cell lineage relationships among viral genomes and infected cells. To accomplish these goals, we will carry
out the following aims: (1) Characterize lineage, transcriptomic and epigenomic diversity of single latently and
actively infected primary cells. (2) Investigate latency and activation during in vitro differentiation. (3) Survey
single cell diversity of re-activated and in vitro infected cells from cART-suppressed patients. Together, these
aims will produce a comprehensive, integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of the HIV reservoir, identify
DNA and RNA biomarkers of latency, and characterize clonal expansion patterns. Our work also develops a
broadly applicable experimental and computational framework, laying a foundation for the discovery of novel
insights into HIV latency and activation."

Childhood obesity and neurodevelopmental impairments have increased in recent decades and are the most
prevalent conditions threatening child’s health and well-being. The consequences of these conditions signify
the need to identify modifiable factors to target for upstream prevention. Emerging evidence suggests that
prenatal exposures to psychological distress, substance use, and lifestyle factors during critical windows of
fetal development may operate to developmentally program childhood obesity and neurodevelopment (ND).
However, few studies have taken a multiple exposure approach to understand the individual and joint
effects of these exposures. In Aim 1 we will examine the role of in utero exposure to psychological distress
and substance use on child growth, adiposity, obesity, and ND and the extent to which prenatal lifestyle factors
and neighborhood factors may mitigate these associations. Further, while maternal diet and physical activity
impact infant growth and adiposity, few studies in diverse populations have assessed mechanistic pathways
and little is known about their impact on ND. We propose the 24-hour movement profile and metabolomics as
our specialized measures of lifestyle, and obesity and ND as our specialized outcomes. The 24-hour
movement profile incorporates the interdependent relationships between device-based measures of physical
activity and sleep during pregnancy to better inform interventions. Metabolomics can elucidate mechanistic
pathways and will be measured repeatedly on the samples collected according to the ECHO protocol (prenatal
blood, cord blood, postnatal child’s blood, and breastmilk). In Aim 2 we will clarify the joint effects of maternal
prenatal dietary patterns and the 24-hour movement and child growth, obesity, and ND and whether
metabolomic signatures prenatally, at birth, and postnatally mediate these associations. For Aims 1 and 2 we
will also examine how associations vary by neighborhood characteristics and infant sex assigned at birth. In
Aim 3 we will maximize recruitment and retention by implementing evidence-based strategies focused on
engaging diverse groups in clinical research and implementing the ECHO Cohort Protocol applying systematic
quality control approaches and best practices. We propose to contribute to the ECHO Program by recruiting a
diverse cohort of 1,800 pregnant individuals from two medical centers at Kaiser Permanente Northern
California serving a diverse population (~70% racial/ethnic minority groups with 50% having a low income), the
conceiving partner, their resulting child, and to follow all of them at multiple visits after the child is born. In Aim
4 we will explore the role of preconception maternal and paternal lifestyle factors on infant birth size to identify
critical time periods to intervene on to prevent upstream risk factors for childhood obesity and ND. All members
of our diverse research team will have equal opportunity to contribute to all aspects of our project and to be
involved in the new ECHO phase. Findings from this study will have important implications for informing
interventions, prevention strategies and policies to ensure optimal health and well-being for all children."
10908630,"The broad, long-term objective of NY-CHAMP's Project 3 is to inform efforts to improve population maternal
health equity by understanding and addressing the underlying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in
severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and mortality (MM) and ensuring equitable access to quality, culturally
appropriate maternal health care. U.S. racial and ethnic minoritized birthing people are about three times as
likely as non-Hispanic White birthing people to experience life-threatening complications and die during
pregnancy and postpartum. Persistent racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health are not fully explained by
known risk factors. Although structural racism (SR) is viewed as the fundamental cause of health disparities
generally, few, if any, studies have empirically evaluated it role in excess SMM and mortality among racial and
ethnic minority birthing people. Evidence regarding effective policy interventions—at state, local and hospital
levels—to address SR in SMM/MM is even more scant. We propose a rigorous mixed methods project with
specific aims to: 1) assess the associations of multidimensional indexes of SR with racial and ethnic disparities
in SMM, suicidality, and mortality; and estimate the hospital costs of SMM attributable to SR; 2) assess the
associations of two policy-relevant interventions (i.e., Medicaid eligibility generosity and healthcare workforce
diversity) with racial and ethnic disparities in SMM, suicidality, and mortality; and quantify the moderating effects
of these two interventions on associations between SR and maternal health outcomes; and 3) analyze the lived
experiences of patients and community and hospital stakeholders to identify the mechanisms of, and effective
solutions for, SR in maternal health care. We will analyze a robust triangulated set of quantitative and qualitative
data from multiple sources, capturing both national and local samples, and apply a complementary suite of
multilevel modeling, causal inference, and grounded theory research techniques. Data from the Healthcare Cost
and Utilization Project, which provides information on 10 million childbirths from over 1200 hospitals in 21 states
during 2016-2022 (Aims 1-2), will be complemented by prospective in-depth interview and focus group data from
multisector stakeholders (patients, community, hospital) in three New York City hospital sites (Brooklyn,
Washington Heights, Queens) of focus for NY-CHAMP's Intervention Project 2. Aims 1 and 2 will test the
hypotheses that: 1) multidimensional indexes of SR are associated with significantly increased disparities in
SMM, suicidality, and mortality; 2) higher state Medicaid eligibility generosity and healthcare workforce diversity
are independently associated with lower disparities in SMM, suicidality, and mortality; and 3) Medicaid eligibility
generosity and healthcare workforce diversity independently mitigate the impact of SR on disparities in maternal
outcomes. Aim 3 will be hypothesis generating. Findings will help close important gaps in our understanding of
the role that SR plays in SMM/MM disparities and generate urgently needed evidence for informing multilevel
policy interventions to improve maternal health equity in our city, state, and across the country."
10908634,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND POLICY ACTION CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The NY-CHAMP Community Engagement and Policy Action Core (CEPA) will bring together an interdisciplinary,
multi-sector team in a shared leadership and governance model to direct our proposed center of excellence. We
convene for the first time four esteemed community multiple principal investigators (MPIs) - Black Women's
Blueprint (BWB), Northern Manhattan Perinatal Partnership (NMPP), Caribbean Women's Association (CWHA),
and The Bridge Directory, with a broader coalition of community organizations, hospitals, academic institutions,
and governmental agencies from across NYC and NYS deeply invested in maternal health. The broad goals of
our NY-CHAMP CEPA are to assure 1) local community needs, priorities, and assets are the very center of our
Research Center of Excellence, and 2) our scientific endeavors result in maximum impact as well as structural
and policy change in ways that fundamentally alter the drivers of health and health equity for birthing people in
NYS and NYS. To achieve these goals, CEPA will practice intentionality, reflexivity, humility, and trust-building
to lead four aims that serve as critical foundation and scaffolding for NY-CHAMP's community engagement
efforts. In Aim 1, we will provide a sustained platform for iterative community input and engagement across our
research center through the Community-Hospital-Academic Research Governance (CHARGE) Board. In Aim 2,
we will launch a novel community-led maternal health provider + birthing patient training program that prepares
hospital actors for anti-racism, cultural humility, implicit bias, and racial allyship care; and prepares birthing
patients for empowerment, self-advocacy, and activation. In Aim 3, we will conduct a locally-led, co-design
process in parallel urban and rural sites with two safety-net hospitals of the NYC Health + Hospitals network and
in two counties in upstate New York in partnership with the University of Rochester and NYS Department of
Health, to set the stage for scalability for our interventions, findings, and partnership model. In Aim 4, we will
facilitate community-engaged research dissemination, collaboration, and policy action for maternal health equity
in NYC and NYS, including a novel community-led research capacity building project for an innovative virtual
doula care delivery platform. These aims, and the NY-CHAMP goals they support, are perfectly aligned with the
NIH's IMPROVE and UNITE Initiatives to solve and resolve the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis and reduce
disparities for birthing people and families across NYC, NYS, and ultimately the nation."

Since becoming an Associate Professor two and a half years ago, I think back to my years as an Assistant
Professor and realize that my greatest moments of joy came from my mentee’s successes. Moments where they
were awarded their first grant, obtained their first faculty position and a high-impact first authored paper was
accepted all shine brightly in my memories. Equally important were the moments where a trainee came to see
me because they were feeling unsuccessful or unmotivated, and they felt they were not going to succeed in
academics, and through our conversation they arose, reassured about their good ideas, skill set and ability to
move forward in a positive and productive way. Looking forward, I worry about the amount of time committed to
administrative and clinical efforts and believe that obtaining protected time via this K24 will directly lead to
development and enrichment in three areas: 1. Mentoring, 2. Conducting cutting-edge novel research, and 3.
Learning new patient oriented research skills. I truly believe that expanding my time dedicated to mentorship will
have the greatest impact out of the three, because enhancing and supporting the training of passionate, clever,
dedicated trainees will lead to broader effects across medicine and academics relative to my research alone. In
terms of research, e-cigarettes are drug delivery (vaping) devices that entered the country in 2007 and have
exploded in terms of use, especially in adolescents and young adults whom have never smoked. We have no
longitudinal data on the health effects of vaping, particularly on lung and systemic inflammation. By leveraging
our existing cohort of young e-cigarette vapers at UCSD, the research proposed here can obtain longitudinal
data by having these subjects return at 1 and 2 years, thus giving 3 timepoints across which changes in airway
inflammation, microbiome and reactivity, and systemic inflammation can be defined. These data will help us
understand which chronic diseases will arise from chronic e-cigarette use. Asthmatics are using e-cigarettes at
a high rate, most likely because of the successful advertising campaigns tobacco companies have run,
convincing many of the lack of adverse effects of these devices. But patients with asthma have airways and
systemic inflammation, thus they are likely to be more susceptible to the pro-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory effects of vaping. By again leveraging the ongoing patient-oriented research conducted by
our team, I propose here to recruit vaping and non-vaping subjects with TH2-high allergic asthma to assess the
effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation on their underlying disease state. Finally, I propose to dive deeper into
clinical research design and analysis, to improve my ability to conduct high level patient oriented research and
thus yield the highest quality, relevant data possible. With the support of my own mentors (Drs. Atul Malhotra
and Victor Nizet), the support of UCSD, my existing fantastic research team and the mentees to come, I believe
the support of this K24 will make it possible to thrive as a mentor, researcher and life-long learner."
10756169,"Project Abstract/Summary
 The goal of this CRP application is to successfully commercialize a brain MRI technology that feeds
back head motion measurements derived from our Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM)
software to MRI scan participants in order to reduce head motion via behavioral training. Because MRI
scanning produces high-resolution images and does not expose patients to radiation, it has become an
immensely valuable diagnostic tool, particularly for imaging the brain. Last year, in the United States alone,
there were over 8 million brain MRIs, costing an estimated $20-30 billion. Unfortunately, brain MRIs are limited
by the fact that head motion during the scan can cause the resulting images to be suboptimal or even
unusable. An estimated 20% of all brain MRIs are ruined by motion, wasting $2-4 billion annually. Currently,
there are two predominant strategies to combat head motion: repeat scanning and anesthesia, both of which
are inadequate. Repeat scanning, which consists of acquiring extra images (to ensure enough usable ones
were acquired), increases scanning time and cost, and can result in too few usable images or unnecessary
extra images. Anesthesia, which is given to patients who are likely to move (such as young children), presents
a serious safety risk and is sometimes administered unnecessarily (i.e. the patient could hold still without
anesthesia). Anesthesia is never an option for functional MRI (fMRI), which requires participants to be awake.
 The software-based FIRMM-biofeedback solution we developed uses MR images (as they are being
collected) to compute a patient’s head motion in real time during an MRI scan. The availability of real time
motion information enables more informed anesthesia use and reduce excess scanning, making these
methods safer and more efficient. Armed with real time motion information, scan operators will know exactly
how many usable images have been acquired, preventing the acquisition of too many or too few extra images.
Additionally, providing physicians with quantitative information about patient motion will allow them to make an
informed decision regarding anesthesia, preventing unnecessary sedation.
 FIRMM technology provides a completely new biobehavioral method for combating head motion:
patient biofeedback. FIRMM can translate the head motion information into age-appropriate, visual
biofeedback for the scan participant. By providing feedback to patients and research subjects, the FIRMM-
biofeedback technology helps both pediatric and adult patients remain more still, improving image quality. The
proposed research focuses on completing late-stage development for FIRMM-biofeedback getting ready for
commercialization, by building a marketing and reimbursement strategy. The FIRMM-biofeedback technology
provides patients and research subjects with real time head motion information, with the goal of making MR
scans safer, faster, more enjoyable and less expensive."
10756170,"Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of focal (partial) or location related epilepsy. It
affects about 60 percent of all people with epilepsy and can occur at any age. The kainic acid model of
temporal lobe epilepsy has greatly contributed to the understanding of the molecular, cellular and
pharmacological mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. This model presents with neuropathological features
that are seen in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. There are many potential causes, and often the exact
cause is unknown. Excessive presynaptic glutamate (Glu) release causes excessive stimulation of NMDA
receptors that is implicated in many CNS disorders that result in acute and chronic neurodegeneration
including epilepsy. Mechanisms to reduce excessive synaptic Glu release under these conditions could
potentially prevent/reduce excitotoxic damage to vulnerable hippocampal neurons. Current treatment options
to prevent excessive Glu release are limited and most post-synaptic interventions in human studies have been
disappointing because of poor efficacy or unacceptable side effects. Under normal conditions, maintenance of
synaptic cytoplasmic Glu levels (~2mM) required for vesicular filling is via α-ketoglutarate-derived Glu
synthesis. The scientific premise for the proposed project is that glutamine (Gln) is a precursor for Glu
synthesis under high synaptic activity because under increased excitatory activity Gln is imported into axon
terminals from glia where it is synthesized. Hence, Na+-dependent Gln import into neurons from glia to
replenish synaptic cytoplasmic Glu stores under high synaptic activity is a potential novel target to prevent
excessive Glu release under excitotoxic conditions. We have recently discovered a neuronal activity-regulated
Gln transporter expressed in excitatory synapses that is potently inhibited by riluzole, a benzothiazole
compound that is believed to inhibit excessive Glu release from synapses. A critical barrier to progress in
understanding the presynaptic mechanisms involved in excessive Glu release has been the lack of molecular
information about the transporter that mediates K+-stimulated, activity-regulated Gln import into excitatory
synapses. In addition, the role of activity-regulated Gln transport in synapses to support excessive Glu release
and neural injury has not been revealed and potential therapeutic agents that target activity-regulated Gln
transport in synapses and that are neuroprotective, more selective, brain penetrant, with fewer side effects
than riluzole have not been developed. This project has important implications in advancing basic
understanding of the neurobiology of excessive synaptic release of Glu, Glu/Gln cycling between neuronal and
glial synapses, and Glu-induced neuronal excitotoxicity. Resolution of this missing link of the role for activity-regulated Gln transport in synaptic Glu synthesis in hippocampal neurons provide the basis for studies in in
vitro and in vivo models of excessive Glu release to better understand the fundamental presynaptic
mechanisms that lead to presynaptic Glu-induced acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases."

Methamphetamine (MA) use and related morbidity and mortality are rapidly increasing in the United States. MA
use disproportionately impacts cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and is strongly associated with
increased risk for HIV acquisition. MA use is also associated with suboptimal pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
adherence, diminishing the benefit of daily, oral PrEP for HIV prevention among MSM who use MA. Long-
acting (LA) PrEP is a promising prevention strategy for MSM who use MA, since its effectiveness does not rely
on daily medication adherence. In December 2021, long acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) PrEP received FDA
approval, after it was found to be superior to daily, oral Truvada. There are other LA PrEP agents in earlier
stages of development, including biannual injections and subdermal implants.
To help ensure that populations at highest risk for HIV effectively engage in LA PrEP programs, we will assess
interest in different LA PrEP formulations, and facilitators, barriers, and preferences for delivery of CAB LA
PrEP among MSM who use MA. We will assess the level of interest and correlates of interest in different LA
PrEP formulations among MSM who use MA via the 2023 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) survey
at five of the western US sites (San Francisco and San Diego, CA; Portland, OR; Seattle, WA; and Denver,
CO) (Aim 1). We will explore multilevel (i.e., on the patient, provider, and system level) barriers to and
facilitators of LA PrEP use and important attributes of CAB LA PrEP delivery through in-depth interviews (Aim
2). We will interview up to 40 HIV-negative MSM who use MA (up to 20 who have never taken PrEP and 20
who have) and up to 20 key informants (e.g., clinicians, service providers). We will identify important attributes
and levels for LA PrEP delivery across interviews to inform a subsequent discrete choice experiment (DCE).
Prior to the DCE we will conduct 10 cognitive interviews to ensure that the DCE inputs accurately capture the
perspectives shared during the initial interviews. We will then conduct a DCE (Aim 3) to identify preferences for
CAB LA PrEP delivery among MSM who use MA using the final attributes and levels from Aim 2. Our findings
will inform engagement of MSM who use MA in LA PrEP programs and the development of an intervention that
will be evaluated in a future trial."

There are approximately a quarter of a billion people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)
who are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The loss of life due to HBV-related
complications each year is about 820,000 people. At the same time human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects
about 38 million people worldwide. Among those, 7.4% globally and 15-28% in highly endemic areas are also
infected with HBV. HIV co-infections pose a serious health burden as they accelerate the progression to liver
cirrhosis and liver cancer with mechanisms that are still not well understood.
 Chronicity of HBV infections is linked to the stability and maintenance of the covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA), which is the nuclear form of the HBV genome. As HBV infects human hepatocytes in the liver, the
cccDNA is established in these cells and strategies that aim to inactivate or eliminate it are considered the
solution to a functional cure. Current treatments against chronic HBV include nucleoside analogs and interferon
α. While nucleoside analogs do not directly affect the cccDNA, a limited number of patients that receive interferon
α or nucleoside analogs can resolve the infection and achieve a cure. The need for a global HBV cure is urgent,
which is also why several approaches and investigational compounds aim for a cure.
 HBV is an exclusive hepatotropic virus that only infects human hepatocytes. HBV studies have been hindered
by limited cell culture systems that include hepatoma cells after overexpression of the HBV receptor NTCP and
primary human hepatocytes. The latter are the most physiologically relevant cells, but their availability and the
inherent limitations of primary cells makes it difficult to use them to recapitulate the complete HBV lifecycle. To
this end, we have developed cell culture systems based on primary human hepatocytes, isolated from
humanized mice, that efficiently support long-term HBV infection and spread. Moreover, we developed a system
of isolating these cells from HBV-infected humanized mice which provides unique opportunities for research.
Specifically, cells are chronically infected with HBV and therefore carry high levels of cccDNA, which allows for
modeling chronic HBV in vitro. Here we propose to use these innovative hepatocyte systems to establish robust
co-cultures with CD4+ T cells for studying HIV/HBV co-infections in physiologically relevant primary cell culture
systems. Overall, with our proposed work we will gain insights on the effects of HIV co-infection on HBV lifecycle
and hepatocyte responses and we will establish a platform to identify novel antiviral strategies with the goal for
a functional HBV cure."

(cccDNA), which is the nuclear form of the HBV genome. As HBV infects human hepatocytes in the liver, the
cccDNA is established in these cells and strategies that aim to inactivate or eliminate it are considered the
solution to a functional cure. Current treatments against chronic HBV include nucleoside analogs and interferon
α. While nucleoside analogs do not directly affect the cccDNA, a limited number of patients that receive interferon
α or nucleoside analogs can resolve the infection and achieve a cure. The need for a global HBV cure is urgent,
which is also why several approaches and investigational compounds aim for a cure.
 HBV is an exclusive hepatotropic virus that only infects human hepatocytes. HBV studies have been hindered
by limited cell culture systems that include hepatoma cells after overexpression of the HBV receptor NTCP and
primary human hepatocytes. The latter are the most physiologically relevant cells, but their availability and the
inherent limitations of primary cells makes it difficult to use them to recapitulate the complete HBV lifecycle. To
this end, we have developed cell culture systems based on primary human hepatocytes, isolated from
humanized mice, that efficiently support long-term HBV infection and spread. Moreover, we developed a system
of isolating these cells from HBV-infected humanized mice which provides unique opportunities for research.
Specifically, cells are chronically infected with HBV and therefore carry high levels of cccDNA, which allows for
modeling chronic HBV in vitro. Here we propose to use these innovative hepatocyte systems to establish robust
co-cultures with CD4+ T cells for studying HIV/HBV co-infections in physiologically relevant primary cell culture
systems. Overall, with our proposed work we will gain insights on the effects of HIV co-infection on HBV lifecycle
and hepatocyte responses and we will establish a platform to identify novel antiviral strategies with the goal for
a functional HBV cure."

Background. As sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries embark on the last mile toward HIV elimination, HIV
programs must prioritize hard-to-reach mobile populations at the greatest risk of HIV acquisition and onward
transmission. Some differentiated service delivery models may work for mobile people, but targeting services to
such a broad category of individuals could waste limited resources. Since it is unclear which forms of mobility
most significantly increase the risk of HIV infection, this study aims to systematically characterize mobility and
relate it to HIV incidence at both the individual and sexual network levels. Aims. In line with NIMH Human
Mobility and HIV program objectives to determine incidence rates and examine HIV outcomes among mobile
populations, this study will 1) characterize mobility and its association with HIV testing and viral load suppression,
2) estimate HIV incidence by mobile group, and 3) determine the effect of mobility on the risk of HIV acquisition
in sexual networks. Elucidating these gaps will inform future targeting and tailoring of interventions to improve
the health of mobile populations. Approach. Since no consistent measure for mobility exists across HIV studies
in SSA, this research will use detailed mobility metrics from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a
population-based longitudinal study in south-central Uganda where there is substantial human movement, to
develop a multidimensional measure that considers the frequency, duration, motivation, and spatial dimensions
to people’s movement. This measure will uncover subclasses of mobility that can be linked to HIV incidence and
other prevention and treatment outcomes. RCCS data from 19,300 adults aged 15-49 will be supplemented with
data from Hard-to-Reach (HTR), an embedded study within the RCCS that captures HIV outcomes and mobility
patterns among 2,000 individuals who have been lost to follow-up (LTFU) in the RCCS. This presents a unique
opportunity to assess the missing data biases introduced by population mobility in open, dynamic cohorts. Each
Specific Aim will use the full extent of the available data, including longitudinal HIV biomarkers and detailed
contact investigations conducted among HIV incident cases and their HIV-negative matched controls. Training.
Ms. Khalifa’s training plan leverages her quantitative abilities and HIV research experience to advance her skills
and launch her into a career as an independent investigator focused on mobility and health. Her training goals
are to develop in-depth knowledge of mobility and migration, gain experience with longitudinal survey methods,
learn advanced epidemiologic techniques for missing data and network analyses, and build capacity for effective
research dissemination. Under the guidance of her Primary Sponsor, Ms. Khalifa will receive tailored mentorship
from a team of experienced HIV researchers who work with the parent studies, conduct mobility-focused
research, and have tremendous expertise in the requisite quantitative methods. Training will take place at
Columbia University, a high-caliber institution with specialized research programs in population health, infectious
disease, and spatial and social epidemiology."

Improving children’s diets and physical activity levels are key strategies to reduce the risk of obesity. However,
most children do not meet dietary or physical activity recommendations, and children who are from families
with socioeconomic disadvantages and/or who are racial/ethnic minorities experience disproportionately higher
rates of obesity, with Alaska Native/American Indian children experiencing the highest rates nationally. Schools
can be an ideal location to promote healthier habits as children spend a substantial portion of their time in
school and often consume up to half their daily energy intake there. Two promising, cost-effective school
policies are longer lunch periods and longer recess with integrated PA opportunities, but rigorous evidence is
lacking. In this time-sensitive proposal, we propose to evaluate a natural experiment in Anchorage, Alaska of
the implementation of a wellness initiative in elementary schools that includes 30 minute lunch periods and 54
minutes of PA daily (including 30 minutes of recess in addition to classroom movement activities). The
wellness initiative will have a staggered rollout in schools over the span of four years. Our study will collect
longitudinal data from 4,000 students in K-4th grade to assess changes in school meal consumption using plate
waste methodology (Aim 1). Physical activity levels will also be assessed in a subsample of children (n=2,000
students in grades K-4) using accelerometer measurements (Aim 2). Outcomes will be measured at baseline
and post-implementation the following school year (collected during the same month at each time point).
Additionally, BMI, sleep duration and quality, and other factors related to academic performance (i.e., changes
in students’ disruptive classroom behaviors [measured at baseline and one year post-implementation],
disciplinary referrals to the principal, hunger-related visits to the school nurse, and standardized test scores
[baseline and up to four years post-implementation]) will be evaluated. Implementation fidelity will be assessed
throughout the study period via site visits, environmental scans, and teacher surveys. Anchorage School
District plans the staggered implementation of the initiative to begin in the 2021-22 school year. Thus, time-
sensitive funding is critical to ensure adequate time for baseline data collection. The proposal’s significance
lies in our ability to provide the first empirical evidence of the degree to which school policies for longer lunch
periods and integrated physical activity opportunities influence students’ dietary intakes, physical activity levels,
weight status, and factors related to academic performance. This rigorous, innovative, and time-sensitive study
will contribute to the development of a comprehensive evidence base on the potential effectiveness of school
nutrition and physical activity policies, which can help to address health disparities in children, including among
an underserved and understudied Alaska Native population. Study results will also provide essential evidence
to inform local, state, and federal policymakers’ decisions regarding school nutrition and physical activity
policies as well as have the strong potential to impact children’s health more broadly."

This proposal details Dr. John Stendahl’s research and training plan for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research
Career Development Award. Dr. Stendahl’s research focuses on the shortage of donor hearts available for
transplantation. He proposes to address this issue by utilizing ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion in the
pretransplant setting as a platform to assess marginal donor hearts and treat them with vascular-targeted
nanomedicines. This work is based on the hypothesis that achieving clinically significant delivery of
nanomedicines in ex vivo donor hearts requires: a) restoration of microvascular perfusion following the insult of
cold ischemia, and b) robust methods of nanoparticle targeting. The first aim of the proposal is to optimize
microvascular blood flow in hearts undergoing ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion. The plan to accomplish
this involves evaluation of the microvasculature with microscopy and multimodal cardiac imaging, and the
application of pharmacologic treatments to restore flow. The second aim is to engineer vascular-targeted
nanoparticles for delivery to human hearts during ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion. This involves potent
new methods of nanoparticle targeting and further application of diagnostic imaging to assess nanoparticle
delivery. Successful completion of these aims will provide powerful, clinically adaptable technologies to improve
donor heart preservation and achieve more efficient usage of marginal organs.
Dr. Stendahl is an instructor in the Yale School of Medicine’s Section of Cardiovascular Medicine and recently
completed fellowship training in Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging. His proposed research builds upon his
backgrounds in bioengineering, organ transplantation, and cardiac imaging. He is supported by an outstanding
mentorship team consisting of Albert Sinusas, MD, an expert in multimodal cardiac imaging, and Gregory Tietjen,
PhD, an expert in targeted nanoparticle delivery and machine perfusion of organs. The proposed work leverages
outstanding facilities at the Yale School of Medicine, including state-of-the-art medical imaging equipment. Dr.
Stendahl’s structured training plan for scientific and professional development includes lectures, coursework in
science and ethics, personal meetings with mentors and consultants, and attendance at national meetings
related to cardiac imaging, therapeutic delivery, and organ transplantation. He plans to utilize the knowledge and
data gained during the mentored training period to generate applications for independent research funding. In
summary, this proposal outlines Dr. Stendahl’s plan for scientific investigation and describes the mentoring and

10747306,"Project Summary
 The long-term goal of our research is to develop first-in-class, protein-based inhibitors against human
bacterial pathogens by directly blocking efflux pumps. Drug resistant bacteria pose an urgent global health
challenge by reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals. The
broadest resistance mechanism against antibiotics are efflux pumps, which transport drugs out of the cytoplasm
and reduce toxicity to the organism. While it is known that efflux pumps display broad specificity to structurally
distinct compounds, the mechanisms of polyspecific drug binding and ion-coupled transport remain unanswered
questions in the field. Given the promiscuity of efflux pump binding to structurally distinct drugs, it is also unclear
whether potent and selective efflux pump inhibitors can be designed to target specific classes of efflux pumps.
The specific goals of this project are to discover novel mechanisms of active transport in drug resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and to harness this knowledge to design selective inhibitors toward efflux pumps. Our
proposal is strongly motivated by our recent discovery of antibody fragments (Fabs) that bind the Staphylococcus
aureus efflux pump NorA and successful determination of high-resolution cryoEM structures using the Fabs as
fiduciaries. The structures revealed that the Fabs insert a loop into the substrate binding pocket from the
extracellular side, which suggests a design path toward protein- and peptide-based inhibitors. This interaction
is facilitated by an electrostatic interaction between a positively charged arginine on the Fab and two essential
anionic residues within NorA. Building on these preliminary data, we propose to carry out four Specific Aims.
Aim 1 will develop a hybrid approach of cryo-electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively
study the transport cycle of NorA. Aim 2 will seek to determine the molecular basis for polyspecific drug binding.
Aim 3 will design and characterize protein-based inhibitors that target the accessible, outward-open conformation
of NorA. Aim 4 will develop peptides that miniaturize the antibody loops observed in the binding pocket of NorA.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in structural biology, protein engineering,
microbiology, chemical synthesis, and computational chemistry to rapidly answer fundamental questions about
multidrug transport and inhibition of efflux pumps. All of the approaches applied to NorA will be translatable to
other transporter systems."

Over the past two decades, one of the most exciting breakthroughs in biomedical research was the discovery
of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), which curbs active HIV replication to nearly undetectable levels. Despite this
great achievement, ART fails to cure HIV infection because latent reservoirs persist in tissues containing
resting CD4 lymphocytes and other cell types that express low levels of viral products and can be reactivated
in response to immune stimulation. Thus, these latent reservoirs are a critical barrier for a functional cure,
making the need for new approaches even more urgent. To achieve this major goal, we must first identify
novel, critical host factors that can be targeted therapeutically before we can leverage this knowledge for
clinical intervention. To this end, this proposal will investigate a master host factor (KAP1) implicated in
transducing a variety of physiologic immune signal inputs into proviral transcriptional outputs to reveal the
molecular mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic potential. Our work is different from previous studies because
it will help uncouple the contribution of the three major features influencing proviral transcription and fate
(complex transcriptional circuit architecture, integration landscape, and immune cell state) to help devise
rationale approaches for HIV eradication. We hypothesize that both the integration landscape and immune cell
state regulate the outcome of an infection (active, latent, reactivated) through the function of critical master
host factors like KAP1. New technologies and experimental approaches for investigating this problem provide
unique opportunities to test this hypothesis and define the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we
will investigate: 1) how KAP1 communicates with other host co-factors to assemble a positive transcription
complex to promote the latency-reactivation switch in response to immune stimulation, 2) how the integration
landscape and cell state influence KAP1-mediated proviral transcription activation and clonal expansion, 3)
how KAP1 recognizes proviral chromatin to function as a ‘scaffold’ to couple transcription initiation and
elongation, and 4) how KAP1 enzymatic functions help relieve the repression imparted by novel transcriptional
co-repressors assembled at the provirus during the latency-reactivation switch. The knowledge generated in
this study will establish the groundwork for interfering with the function of various “druggable pockets” (e.g.,
enzymatic and chromatin reader domains) for HIV eradication strategies. The combination of high significance,
innovation and use of a diverse set of experimental approaches in physiologically relevant systems (primary
models of latency and patient samples) make this proposal unique. Collectively, these studies could have a
revolutionary impact on our understanding of HIV latency biology and have therapeutic implications."

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) was the first described primary immunodeficiency (PID). By 1946, it was
shown by Lutz to be an autosomal recessive (AR) predisposition to skin-tropic viruses, prior to the description of
congenital neutropenia by Kostmann (1950). Its lack of associated immunological phenotypes long prevented its
recognition as a PID. EV is characterized by disseminated and persistent flat warts, which often evolve into skin
cancer. The lesions are caused by E5- and E8-deficient members of the β genus of human papillomaviruses
(HPVs), which exclusively reside in keratinocytes and remain silent in the general population. EV typically strikes
otherwise healthy individuals (“isolated EV”), or rarely occurs in the context of other infectious diseases
(“syndromic EV”). In 2002, bi-allelic mutations in TMC6 and TMC8, encoding EVER1 and EVER2, were found in
patients with isolated EV, whose T cells were normal. Bi-allelic mutations in CIB1 were reported in 2018 in other
patients with isolated EV. Remarkably, CIB1, EVER1, and EVER2 form a complex that binds to E5 and E8. This
complex operates as a restriction factor governing keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-HPVs. From 2012 onward,
mutations in RHOH, STK4, and other T cell genes were found in patients with syndromic EV. We hypothesize
that other, related single-gene inborn errors of cutaneous immunity against β-HPVs, underlie EV in other patients.
The goal of this application is thus to analyze in greater depth the molecular and cellular basis of isolated and
syndromic EV. First, we will discover new genetic etiologies of EV thanks to the ongoing recruitment of unrelated
EV families, by combining genome-wide linkage (GWL) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Second, we will
functionally characterize the novel genotypes by studying the mutant proteins in isolation and in the patients’
cells, including their relationship with the products of the known EV-causing genes, such as the EVER-CIB1
complex in keratinocytes and RhoH or STK4 in T cells. Third, we will model HPV infection of keratinocytes in the
presence of T cells in vitro, with viral proteins and particles, using keratinocyte cell lines, foreskin keratinocytes,
the patients’ keratinocytes, or induced pluripotent step cell (iPSC)-derived keratinocytes, which will be edited by
CRISPR/Cas9. Our project is highly innovative yet supported by strong preliminary data. Indeed, we have
recruited 52 novel families, identified three novel genetic etiologies, underlying isolated (mutations in RBPJ) or
syndromic EV (ITGAL and OX40), and began elucidating their mechanistic connection with keratinocytes and T
cells, respectively. Our research provides novel insights into the mechanisms of cutaneous immunity to β-HPVs,
highlighting the dual contribution of keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity and T-cell adaptive immunity. Our research
benefits EV patients and families, with the development of novel diagnostic approaches, including genetic
counseling, and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on a rational understanding
of the pathogenesis. Finally, the study of EV is a fruitful model to analyze other mucosal and cutaneous illnesses
caused by other HPVs."

Each year over 100,000 Americans begin dialysis when their kidneys lose the capacity to remove
toxins from the blood and half of them die within five years. These high mortality rates are in part
due to the ineffectiveness of dialysis at removing protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) such as
indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, which would otherwise be removed by healthy kidneys.
Herein, we propose a non-invasive ingestible bubble tea to reduce the blood concentration of
PBUTs and improve the outcomes of patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD).
In contrast to conventional treatments, which attempt to remove toxins from the blood by dialysis,
this research offers a radically different approach, which prevents the formation of toxins at their
origin. PBUTs are byproducts of gut microbial metabolism; indole and p-cresol originate in the
gut from fermentation of amino acids and both solutes are sulfonated in the liver to form the
PBUTs indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. We propose a novel microbe enriched bubble tea
which will expand the capacity of the gut to degrade the uremic toxin (UT) precursors (indole and
p-cresol) and thereby prevent their sulfonation to toxic forms in the liver. The bubble components
will be engineered to remain tight in the stomach, hence protecting the hydrogel entrapped
microbes from low pH, and then swell at neutral pH in the small intestine and colon, allowing
UTs to diffuse into the hydrogel where the UT degrading microorganisms will deactivate them.
Finally, the bubble tea will be excreted intact without altering the natural gut microbiome. This
concept builds on the successful applications of microbe enriched hydrogels in bioengineering
and environmental engineering for drug delivery and wastewater treatment.
We will develop the bubble tea by first enriching novel indole and p-cresol degrading microbes
from the environment, second engineering specialized hydrogel carriers for the microbes, and
finally replicating their trip through the gut in well controlled bioreactor units. The substrate
profiles, pH gradients, and removal rates will be experimentally measured and mathematically
simulated to visualize spatial localization of bacteria and to determine UT degradation over time.
Delivering these hydrogels in a formulated bubble tea drink could improve the lives of chronic
kidney disease and ESKD patients by reducing the burden from uremic symptoms and
complications."
10763417,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a devastating disease with an overall 5-year survival
rate of only ~60%. In part, this high death rate is a result of late disease diagnosis, often with regional lymph
node metastasis. Recent studies, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE), mapped genomic alterations in a variety of cancers, and are beginning to provide
insights into the dysregulated signals contributing to the onset and progression of HNSCC, but there has been
only modest improvement in therapeutic strategies. This lack of progress is partly due to a lack of mechanistic
understanding of the signals that drive malignant transformation.
Prior and ongoing studies carried out in our laboratories have identified multiple homeostatic pathways whose
deregulation contributes to HNSCC HPV(-) initiation, development and progression. In particular, we have
shown that pharmacologic inhibition of the interaction between 𝛽𝛽-catenin and the histone acetyltransferase
cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) inhibits HNSCC cell proliferation and CSC
phenotypes, and reduces invasive traits. Conversely, we showed that elevated β-catenin/CBP signaling in
primary HNSCC tumors was associated with tumor progression and poor patient survival. We also showed a
strong association between WNT/𝛽𝛽-catenin, the oncogenic activity of the paralogous transcriptional regulators
YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), and of mTOR, suggesting interactions between these pathways.
Thus, our proposal seeks to elucidate, through computational approaches, the molecular links between
somatic variation, the activity of selected homeostatic pathways (𝛽𝛽-catenin/CBP, TAZ/YAP, mTOR and others),
and EMT and CSC phenotypes in early and advanced stages of HNSCC. To achieve this goal, we will perform
integrative analyses of public multi-omics datasets from human and mouse, leveraging our newly developed
methods of taxonomy discovery and gene regulatory network (GRN) inference. Application of these methods
will allow us to identify important network hubs and regulators, and how their connectivity changes in response
to perturbation or between phenotypic groups and disease stages. The hypotheses generated will be validated
in in-vitro and in-vivo models we have developed in our laboratories. The results of our analyses will support
the identification of novel candidate drivers of the disease amenable to therapeutic targeting. Three aims are
thus proposed. First, we will analyze publicly available multi-omics datasets from human HNSCC, including
bulk and single-cell RNAseq profiles, proteomics and methylomics profiles, and paired somatic copy number
alterations (SCNAs) and mutations. Second, we will analyze bulk- and sc-RNAseq profiles from premalignant
lesions in mouse and human, including profiles from mice treated with small molecule 𝛽𝛽-catenin/CBP inhibitors.
Finally, we will share all our tools and results through well-documented Bioconductor packages and interactive
web-based portals, which will allow other investigators to use the generated resources in their research."

Considerable efforted is devoted to developing HIV cure regimens that reduce viral reservoirs and boost
antiviral immunity. These interventions seek to permit people with HIV (PWH) to stop ART and durably control
HIV, inducing sustained ART-free remission. However, the virologic and immunologic determinants of ART-
free remission are poorly understood. Therefore, one of the enduring questions for HIV cure research is how
far interventions must reduce viral reservoirs to attain clinically relevant periods of ART-free remission. It is a
common assumption among the HIV research community that the size of HIV reservoirs at ART termination
affects the time to viral rebound (TTR) and the capacity of antiviral immune responses to control virus
replication. Yet, the association between reservoir size and TTR is unknown, and the immunologic basis of
post-treatment viral control (PTC) is unclear. Nevertheless, it is challenging to address these fundamental
questions in human clinical trials due to variability in patient groups and difficulty quantifying extremely small
viral reservoirs in vivo. As a result, mathematical models have been developed to forecast PTC and TTR after
stopping ART. These models predict that viral reservoirs must contain hundreds to thousands of HIV latently
infected cells to delay viral rebound for a few months, and the size of latent reservoirs dictates whether
antiviral immune responses can control HIV replication after stopping ART. However, validating these
predictions in PWH is challenging.
Thus, to empirically test these predictions, we will use a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/rhesus macaque
model to precisely set the size of latent reservoirs in vivo. To do so, we will infuse defined numbers of
autologous in vitro generated SIV latently infected cells into ART-treated, SIV-naïve rhesus macaques.
Further, we will determine the number of latently infected cells that reactivate after stopping ART by
establishing reservoirs with genetically barcoded SIV. Therefore, we will use this novel latency model to
determine how progressively smaller SIV reservoirs affect TTR and PTC in the presence or absence of
antiviral immunity.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the TTR for defined SIV viral reservoirs. In this Aim, we will determine the TTR
for viral reservoirs containing 5e4, 1e4, 1e3, and 1e2 latently infected cells.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of viral reservoir size and antiviral immunity on TTR and PTC. In
this Aim, we will induce antiviral immunity with recombinant rhadinovirus encoding near full-length SIV and
determine the TTR and viral loads post-ART for reservoirs containing 5e4 and 1e3 latently infected cells."

The viral capsid, a cone-shaped protein shell, plays multiple roles during HIV-1 replication and has emerged
as a promising antiviral target. It has been widely accepted that structural and functional constraints limit the
mutational tolerance of the capsid. However, there is growing appreciation that HIV-1 accommodates
phenotypic variability in nearly every capsid-mediated function without compromising viral replicative fitness.
These observations raise the possibility that the capability of HIV-1 capsid to adapt is likely underestimated
and substantial. The evolutionary potential of HIV-1 capsid has direct implications for drug resistance and
serves as the molecular basis for host factor utilization and evasion. In this application, building upon our
previous and preliminary studies, we propose to study the mechanisms and consequences of HIV-1 capsid
variability using a multi-pronged strategy with special focus on the use of large-scale genetic approaches. In
Aim 1, high-throughput mutational analysis of HIV-1 capsid will be conducted to generate comprehensive
resistance profiles of various capsid inhibitors. We will also explore how combinatorial use of different types
of capsid inhibitors can improve antiviral activity through synergistic interactions and/or by restricting
resistance pathways. In Aim 2, to elucidate how HIV-1 exploits multiple host factors via highly charged pores
at the center of each CA multimer, we will study the requirement for these cellular factors in capsid stability
and other post-entry steps among diverse lentiviruses. Additionally, deep mutational scanning and detailed
phenotyping will be applied to the central pore of HIV-1 capsid. In Aim 3, leveraging the availability of HIV-1
variants with varying uncoating kinetics, we will study the role of the capsid in shielding viral DNA from innate
sensors in the context of cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1. Second, to determine how the impacts of the
capsid on viral DNA sensing can define the fate of viral infection, we will develop novel experimental assays
that enable quantification of viral latency and competitions in a co-culture system. These studies will increase
our understanding of the molecular basis for capsid-mediated functions. New findings will provide valuable
insights into the evolutionary potential of HIV-1 capsid and may be harnessed to aid in the discovery and
design of novel capsid targeting antivirals."

health progress made over the past century. There is limited evidence on how EWEs affect care outcomes
among the 37 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), particularly in geographic regions most vulnerable
to EWEs. Cross-sectional studies have shown both drought and excess rainfall to be associated with higher
HIV prevalence. However, very little is known about how EWEs impact short- and long-term HIV care
outcomes. Our preliminary analysis of data from 11 sub-Saharan African countries found that extreme rainfall
may delay the timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increase loss to follow-up among those newly
enrolling in HIV care. Our preliminary qualitative work in Kenya suggests that exposure to drought and flooding
adversely affects HIV outcomes through decreased food availability and ART adherence and increased
infectious disease incidence. The absence of rigorous longitudinal assessments of the relationships and causal
pathways between EWE exposures and HIV care outcomes remains a crucial gap in knowledge and obstacle
to intervention development. The global IeDEA cohort collaboration, with >2 million PLWH enrolled in HIV care
in 44 countries over a long time horizon (2004-present) provides an unparalleled opportunity to characterize
the influence of EWEs on HIV care outcomes across several geographic contexts and sub-populations of
PLWH (e.g., those with advanced disease, adolescents, those who are pregnant, etc).
 The proposed 5-year, mixed methods study will combine high resolution daily data on temperature and
rainfall from five publicly available climate datasets with the global IeDEA cohort data from 2004-present to
longitudinally assess the impacts of EWEs on HIV care outcomes (timely ART initiation HIV viral load
monitoring, and HIV viral suppression) (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will use a mixed methods approach to explore
subgroups of vulnerability and resilience to EWEs among PLWH, mechanisms of impact, and adaptation and
mitigation strategies employed in specific communities to inform interventions. In Aim 3, we will create and
disseminate a country-level public use climate dataset with geocoded temperature and rainfall data going back
to 1984 for ready use by other investigators, program implementers, and policymakers. We expect this novel
study to inform climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, and lay the groundwork for the development of
other targeted (population and region-specific) interventions to address deleterious health effects of EWEs.
Moreover, we expect our study to have significant implications for global health programs, policies,
mathematical modelers and funders, creating new health-related applications for climate datasets."

 Residual cancer cells left behind following surgery increase the chance of cancer returning
in almost every cancer subtype. The current inability to identify these tumor cells during surgery
hinders cancer care across the spectrum, including breast and prostate cancers, as 20-40% of
these patients suffer from positive margins, which doubles the risk of cancer returning.
 This proposal solves this problem through an original approach for ultrasensitive optical
imaging of cancer cells in live tissue and during surgery. Current intraoperative imaging methods
are unable to achieve high sensitivity both on the tissue surface and at depth due to inherent
physical limits of both current optical probes and their requisite imagers. They are also too bulky
to be integrated onto modern surgical tools, which could guide precision surgery with far greater
accuracy than achievable today. Here, we address these dual challenges by introducing a wholly
new imaging strategy integrating nanotechnology, protein engineering, and advanced imager
design with the goal of real-time highly sensitive intraoperative imaging of cancer cells, both on
the surface and at depth. We propose major advances in nanotechnology to redesign
upconverting nanoparticles as optical probes that can be safely imaged in tissue, protein
engineering to produce antibodies that selectively target the probes to tumor, and detector
engineering to build an ultrathin imaging chip, directly integrated into surgical instrumentation.
The combination of these novel technologies transforms instruments themselves into imagers to
dramatically increase the sensitivity in identifying cancer cells, with the ultimate goal of being able
to identify, in real time, all residual disease."

To improve our understanding of human disease in ancestrally diverse populations, we propose to establish
the Washington University Omics Production Center (WU-omics PC). As part of the Multi-Omics of Health and
Disease Consortium, the WU-omics PC will help design a collaborative plan to: (i) explore the use of multi-
omics, environmental exposure data, and phenotypic information to assess disease states; (ii) develop
methods for data harmonization, integration, and interpretation in multi-omics studies; and (iii) create a rich set
of robust multi-dimensional data to share with the research community. In the first year of the award, the WU-
omics PC will work closely with other members of the Consortium to design a project roadmap that details
strategies for subject recruitment, the types of biospecimens to be collected, sample handling and shipping
procedures, omics techniques to be performed, and best practices for transferring and integrating harmonized
data. After year 1, we propose for the WU-omics PC to collect whole genome sequencing, whole genome
bisulfite sequencing, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, proteomics, and metabolomics data by using the agreed upon
methods. The WU-omics PC will collect omics data by using well-established workflows that the same
investigative team has already successfully applied to other multi-omics studies of similar scope and scale. Our
omics workflows have been extensively benchmarked and we have detailed protocols for quality assurance,
quality control, and correction of batch effects. The WU-omics PC is uniquely positioned to accomplish its
goals because the infrastructure to perform large-scale, high-throughput omics assays is already in place.
Moreover, the leadership of the WU-omics PC has a successful track record of participating in omics consortia
and provides complementary and synergistic research expertise in genetics, biochemistry, analytical
instrumentation, computational data processing, and multi-dimensional data integration."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) afflicts millions of individuals and their families each year. AUD is frequently
comorbid with anxiety and depression, indicating potential sources for the motivation to consume alcohol.
Alcoholics commonly list stressors and negative affective states as leading triggers of cravings and relapse,
and severity of the disease state correlates with relapse susceptibility. The health and financial burden
associated with AUD highlights the pressing need for more research focused on understanding the interaction
between AUD and negative affective disturbances. Identifying key neuroadaptations driving this debilitating
disease is essential for developing better diagnostic tools and treatments for affective symptoms in alcohol
abstinence. Converging evidence suggests the transition from social use to negative reinforcement-driven
alcohol seeking involves a set of brain structures collectively referred to as the extended amygdala. The bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a component of the extended amygdala network, is a critical node for
stress-related disorders such as anxiety, depression, and addiction. The BNST plays a prominent role in many
facets of alcohol addiction including binge drinking and cravings in withdrawal. The BNST interacts with many
cortical, subcortical, midbrain, and hindbrain regions to determine general affect. Our recent work identified a
functional connection between the insular cortex (insula) and the BNST. The insula is involved in interoceptive
awareness, cognitive control, and sensory processing, and mounting evidence suggests a role for the insula in
alcoholism and negative affective disturbances. We used a mouse model of chronic drinking followed by forced
abstinence (CDFA) to outline a definitive role for the insula-BNST pathway in abstinence-induced negative
affect, and this proposal will significantly build on this foundational evidence. We will combine in vivo calcium
fiber photometry and ex vivo electrophysiology with genetic mouse lines and a variety of sophisticated viral-
genetic techniques to isolate circuit-specific neuronal ensembles. The mentored (K99) phase will provide
training in fiber photometry and complex viral-genetic manipulation strategies to determine the functional and
physiological state of BNST neurons receiving insular inputs (Aim 1) and insular neurons that project to the
BNST (Aim 2) in the protracted abstinence phase of CDFA. The independent (R00) phase will identify 2nd order
inputs onto insulaàBNST neurons, with the goal of further delineating the complex neurocircuitry regulating
abstinence-induced negative affect. The proposed studies and related career development training plan in this
Pathway to Independence Award collectively provide the ideal mechanism to transition the applicant to a

RNA regulatory networks in neuronal cell type diversity and function
The mammalian brain is probably the most complex organ in the body and its proper function requires
coordination of many diverse types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that form distinct functional circuitries.
Characterization of neuronal cell types is fundamental to understand not only how the brain works, but also how
specific cell types are selectively affected in multiple neuronal disorders and how this process can be reversed.
A large number of neuronal cell types were recently defined based on their gene expression profiles in bulk and
single cells, and these cell types are organized into a hierarchical cell taxonomy. Alternative splicing is a
mechanism to generate multiple transcript and protein variants with distinct functions, thus providing a major
driving force of the molecular diversity in mammals. The overarching goal of my research group is to understand
the contribution of alternative splicing and the underlying RNA-regulatory networks in the brain and brain-related
disorders. Previous work from multiple groups, including ours, unambiguously demonstrated that the brain has
unique splicing-regulatory programs compared to non-neuronal tissues. Our studies also revealed the
establishment of a pan-neuronal splicing program regulated by multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) during
neural development, and demonstrated the important role of the Rbfox protein family in regulating axonal
maturation and neuronal excitability. However, how alternative splicing contributes to the distinct molecular
profiles of diverse neuronal cell types in the cortex is currently poorly understood. We hypothesize that the
transcriptome diversity generated by highly regulated alternative exons is a major component that specifies
neuronal cell type identity and function. In this application, we describe our preliminary analysis of neuronal cell
type-specific alternative splicing regulation in mouse cortex, which provides strong support for the following
specific aims we would like to pursue: 1) Perform systematic analysis of neuronal cell type-specific alternative
splicing to identify novel neuronal subclasses and regulators using deep sc-RNA-seq data. 2) Validate our
computational predictions and characterize mechanisms of neuronal cell type-specific splicing regulation and
function using two complementary model systems: the distinction of two major subclasses of GABAergic
interneurons originating from caudal (CGE) and medial (MGE) ganglionic eminences, and a GABAergic neuron-
specific microexon in Ank3/Ankyrin G. To achieve our goal, we will use a multidisciplinary approach that
integrates cutting-edge statistical an machine learning methods and multiple in vitro and in vivo experimental
models. This study will generate a global and mechanistic view of precise alternative splicing regulation across
diverse neuronal cell types and illuminate its impact on neuronal structural and functional properties."

Entitled “Creating Statewide Community Partnerships: Spanning Boundaries Between Public Health,
Emergency Housing, and Criminal Justice,” this proposal seeks to bridge a siloed behavioral health
landscape across Michigan. During the project, the team will develop, implement, and test multiple
activities to bridge structural gaps and improve downstream impacts. The first is developing and
implementing a statewide behavioral healthcare crises system via a virtual dual-diagnosis urgent care entity
(V-DUCE) that provides on-demand, same-day access to crisis services such as recovery-oriented care,
emergency housing, diversion and reentry services, and other behavioral and medical service referrals and
care. The second is to collaborate with courts and jails to facilitate diversion for individuals with concurrent
health needs. Third, a system will be implemented to redirect individuals experiencing behavioral health
crises with unmet human service needs from hospital emergency departments to V-DUCE based culturally-
responsive staff member with lived-experience as their initial point of contact. Fourth, the project will work
to create a clear, immediate pathway to emergency housing for individuals seeking recovery who have
additional crisis care needs. Finally, our intervention provides a systematic approach to addressing the broad
public health issue of unmanaged chronic health conditions within our population of focus. An innovative
approach known as boundary spanning will be used to implement these activities, which involves
employing individuals with a deep knowledge of local systems to staff the V-DUCE and provide concurrent
service initiation. This project advances NIH's mission by assisting individuals with multiple chronic
conditions, enhancing public health and eliminating health disparities."
10778592,"Movement is a volitional behavior linked to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Though many older adults show some degree of Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies, the extent that these pathologies degrade movement varies. The same amount of Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies may be related to rapid decline in one adult and little loss in another. An adult who maintains movement or has a slower rate of decline in the presence of Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies manifests motor resilience. To promote motor resilience, it is crucial to identify risk factors or proteins that offset the negative effects of Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies. Shared neural substrate underlies motor and cognitive resources that control movement. So, it’s not surprising that cognitive resilience proteins are related to motor resilience. This study will complement our ongoing discovery of resilience using deep omics in “cognitive” brain regions with deep omics in key “motor regions” to identify new genes and proteins that may provide motor and cognitive resilience. 
This study responds to NOT-AG-20-053. We selected 3 key motor tissues in which to identify motor resilience proteins that may offset the negative effects of pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and degeneration in motor systems. We will then test if some of these proteins also provide cognitive resilience.
Compelling data support this study: 1) Alzheimer’s disease pathology in brainstem and spinal cord is related to a higher odds of dementia. 2) Large individual differences in degeneration of spinal motoneurons, nerve and muscle, highlight the need to measure their degeneration to isolate motor resilience. 3) Our systems biology and protein validation approach applied to RNAseq in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) identified cognitive resilience genes and proteins in prior work. 4) This approach can succeed in motor tissues as high quality RNAseq data, summarized as co-expression modules, was obtained from 3 key motor tissues (brain [SMA], spinal cord and muscle) from the same decedents. 5) As hypothesized, after isolating motor resilience, we identified proteins in DLPFC that provide resilience for motor or cognitive decline and some that provide resilience for both. 
Motor resilience manifests as slower motor decline. We will quantify Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies in brain, brainstem, spinal cord, nerve and muscle to isolate motor resilience i.e., motor decline not explained by Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies and degeneration. Aim 1 will apply a systems biology approach to transcriptome data from 3 key motor tissues (brain, spinal cord and muscle) to discover genes that may provide motor resilience. Aim 2 will verify these genes with SRM proteins and validate that these proteins are related to motor decline in an independent sample of adults. Aim 3 will test if motor resilience proteins also provide cognitive resilience and if aggregating multiple proteins into a person-specific index quantifies high and low resilience related to Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes. Aim 4 will test if resilience proteins link risk factors with motor and cognitive decline. Resilience proteins are high value targets for drug discovery to maintain motor and cognitive function despite the presence of untreatable Alzheimer’s disease and related pathologies. These data will also inform on mechanisms underlying motor and cognitive decline and risk factors which provide resilience."

Candidate and Career Development Plan: Dr. Lavine is a vitreoretinal surgeon, physician-scientist, and
Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at Northwestern University. Dr. Lavine had a successful PhD, laying his
strong scientific foundation, and has successfully balanced clinical duties with productive, basic science research
in ophthalmology for the past 8 years of clinical training. His long-term career goal is to identify novel cellular and
molecular targets of the innate immune system for anti-angiogenic therapy in order to move vitreoretinal
specialists past the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) era and into individualized medicine. To
accomplish this, his immediate goal is to develop his career as a funded, independent physician-scientist with
expertise in the intersection of inflammation and angiogenesis. This K08 award will help achieve these goals by
developing Dr. Lavine’s scientific and professional skills in advanced immunology and bio-informatics. Dr. Lavine
and his co-mentors, Dr. Perlman and Dr. Quaggin, have developed a detailed strategy to achieve these
objectives through carefully planned course work, didactics, laboratory techniques, and collaborations at
Northwestern University. The current proposal will lay the foundation for future R01-level proposals on the
intersection between innate immunity and angiogenesis in choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
Research Plan: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the
developed world, and is treated solely by inhibiting VEGF. Although highly effective, 15% of patients still lose
vision despite maximal anti-VEGF therapy. Evidence suggests a role for pro-angiogenic macrophages in nAMD
pathogenesis, but currently there are no therapies to specifically target these cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-
inflammatory cytokine known to be produced by macrophages, correlates with nAMD activity and is necessary
for laser-induced CNV, a mouse model of nAMD. Our preliminary data demonstrate that beta2-adrenergic
receptor (AR) inhibition decreases laser-induced CNV area by reducing IL-6 levels in macrophages. Our central
hypothesis is that beta2-AR signaling influences macrophage differentiation, promotes a pro-angiogenic
macrophage phenotype, increases IL-6 levels, and activates angiogenesis by activating the IL-6 receptor directly
on endothelial cells to increase CNV area. To test this hypothesis, we formulated the following specific aims:
1) Determine the retinal/choroidal cell type(s) that express interleukin-6 in response to beta2-AR antagonism
2) Identify the cell type that produces IL-6 and the cell type that responds to IL-6 to increase laser-induced CNV.
3) Delineate how beta2-AR and IL-6 deficiency regulate the transcriptional profile of macrophages during CNV.
Completion of these aims will determine the cell types that respond to beta2-AR antagonism, produce IL-6, and
respond to IL-6 to increase CNV area. These data will set the stage for anti-IL-6 therapy for nAMD. Furthermore,
we will delineate how beta2-AR inhibition influences the transcriptomic profile of macrophages in the CNV milieu,
which will identify new anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic therapeutic targets."

This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will facilitate my long-term career goal of establishing
an independently-funded, interdisciplinary research program focused on collecting and analyzing intensive
longitudinal data (ILD) to understand and reduce substance use disorders (SUDs) in justice-involved and other
high-risk populations, as well as to disseminate the findings to inform and develop mHealth interventions. Justice-
involved young adults are more likely to struggle with SUDs than the general population, and their substance
use often involves polysubstance use rather than single drug use. However, there is limited understanding of the
naturalistic settings and psychological and behavioral antecedents of polysubstance use in vulnerable young
adults. Like other vulnerable subgroups, substance use has often been examined with traditional methodologies,
such as cross-sectional or clinical/lab-based designs; yet, these assessment methods are not well suited to
capture the real-time interactions experienced by most young adults under criminal justice supervision. In line
with NIDA’s strategic objective of addressing real-world complexities of polysubstance use in vulnerable young
adults, as well as identifying the context of these interactions to develop and disseminate effective interventions,
this project will test the momentary psychological, behavioral, and geospatial risk for substance use in young
adults under criminal justice supervision by integrating geographically-explicit ecological momentary assessment
(GEMA) data with risk terrain modeling (RTM). I am a criminologist who uses a developmental psychopathology
framework to study health-risk behaviors across the life course with a strong foundation in developmental
psychopathology, longitudinal design methodologies, and substance use prevention. The proposed research
and career development plan build directly on my prior experiences to provide greater knowledge and skills
necessary to conduct innovative investigations of dynamic person-environment interactions underlying
substance use risk with GEMA and RTM methodologies and to develop a novel just-in-time adaptive intervention
(JITAI) to reduce substance use in young adults enrolled in drug treatment court (DTC). Specific Aim 1 will (a)
identify momentary relationships between daily stressors, affect, and alcohol use in a similarly vulnerable sample
of homeless adults (N=77) that completed up to 5 daily GEMAs for 28 days and (b) test the associations between
momentary geographic correlates of alcohol use and activity spaces on health-risk behaviors by combining
GEMA data with RTM. Specific Aim 2 will collect GEMA data among a sample of young adults aged 18-25
enrolled in DTC to identify intervention targets for a future JITAI. Specific Aim 3 will develop and pilot test a novel
smartphone-based JITAI to reduce substance use in young adults aged 18-25 enrolled in DTC. My mentorship
team is well suited to facilitate the research and career development plan, with combined expertise in SUDs in
vulnerable populations, GEMA analysis and design, RTM, and JITAI implementation and design."

Understanding the mechanisms and behavioral relevance of synaptic plasticity has been an active area of
research for decades. However, how neural plasticity modulates innate behaviors, such as mating behaviors, is
largely unexplored. In addition, cellular and molecular mechanisms of presynaptic neural circuit plasticity remain
elusive. Both knowledge gaps will be addressed in this proposal, which focuses on the mechanisms of
presynaptic plasticity of a hypothalamic circuit that governs male sexual behavior. Male mice improve in their
mating performance after sexual experience, but the underlying neural circuit mechanisms are poorly understood.
We observed a dramatic increase of presynaptic axonal termini in the projection from bed nucleus of stria
terminalis (BNST) neurons expressing tachykinin 1 (BNSTTac1) to preoptic hypothalamus (POA), a circuit that is
essential for male mating behavior. We hypothesize that this structural plasticity in BNSTTac1àPOA projections is
critical for the enhancement of mating behavior following sexual experience. We will first characterize the cellular
(presynaptic bouton dynamics) and electrophysiological (synaptic transmission efficacy) mechanisms of this
plasticity with chronic in vivo imaging and slice recording. Further, we aim to dissect the molecular pathways
underlying this plasticity with deep RNA sequencing and genetic manipulations. Lastly, we will perform
behavioral tests to study how this plasticity modulates the display of male sexual behaviors. Our results will
uncover the specific mechanisms modulating a key brain circuit for controlling mating behavior, which may
inspire potential therapeutic approaches to alleviate low libido in humans."

Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome as well as
developmental deficits in the brain that persist into adulthood. Sensory impairments have been observed, notably
in the auditory system, following prenatal cigarette exposure. Due to the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes,
the need for research into prenatal exposure to nicotine alone is becoming increasingly important. The critical
period of mouse auditory development occurs after birth, allowing for perinatal nicotine exposure to accurately
model prenatal nicotine exposure on auditory system phenotypes. In PNE models, disrupted glutamatergic
signaling in the auditory cortex and impaired temporal processing in an auditory startle test has been reported.
However, the cellular mechanisms whereby perinatal nicotine exposure (PNE) impairs auditory development
and central auditory processing are currently unknown. In the auditory system, cholinergic signaling is necessary
for peripheral and central auditory processes. Recent work demonstrates the importance of nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors in signal-in-noise detection in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the
auditory brainstem. The alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), essential for glutamatergic synapse
development in the hippocampus and cortex, is highly expressed in the MNTB during early postnatal
development. Utilizing the large glutamatergic Calyx of Held synapse of the MNTB, the proposed studies aim to
investigate the effect of PNE on structural and functional development of the calyx terminal, MNTB synapse, and
central auditory processing. The central hypothesis is that PNE increases α7 nAChR expression and its chronic
activation impairs glutamatergic synapse development in the MNTB resulting in central auditory deficits. Due to
the crucial role of MNTB in binaural processing, it is important to examine how the MNTB is affected by PNE
during auditory development to understand auditory processing disorders in children prenatally exposed to
nicotine. Aim 1 examines developmental expression of nAChRs at the calyx-MNTB synapse and the effect of
PNE on nAChR expression using patch-clamp electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. Aim
2 investigates the developmental impact of PNE on the structure and function of calyx of Held synapse. Direct
presynaptic recordings of the calyx terminal will measure vesicular glutamate release followed by 3D
reconstruction of the calyx to quantify structural development. Patch clamp recordings of the MNTB neuron with
afferent fiber stimulation will be done to measure glutamate-mediated currents, and immunohistochemistry will
visualize glutamate receptors in the calyx synapse. Aim 3 tests auditory processing following PNE using in vivo
auditory tests. The proposed aims will reveal cellular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying developmental
nicotine exposure-induced auditory deficits that will be useful for future therapeutics."
10899703,"The cGas/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway detects microbial DNA and plays a critical role in host defense.
Growing evidence indicates that self-DNA that accumulates in the cytosol also engages cGAS to incite
inflammation. In addition, a series of gain-of-function mutations that result in constitutive activation of STING
have now been associated with a debilitating auto-inflammatory disease known as SAVI (STING-Associated-
Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy). These patients suffer from severe vasculitic lesions and progressive
interstitial lung disease (ILD), and frequently succumb to treatment-resistant ILD-associated with fibrosis. Similar
to the lung disorders associated with other inflammatory or fibrotic lung diseases, very little is known about the
pathogenic mechanisms in these patients. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these
conditions is needed in order to develop more effective therapies. We have recently developed a murine model
for the most common SAVI mutation, STINGV154M (VM), and shown that these mice recapitulate the human
disease by a variety of criteria, including the development of inflammatory/fibrotic lung disease. These VM mice
provide a unique experimental tool for exploring the cell types and molecular mechanisms responsible for the
initiation and progression of fibrotic lung disease. Rag1-deficiency completely rescues VM mice from both lung
inflammation and lung fibrosis pointing to a critical role of the adaptive immunity in VM ILD. The role of STING
has been focused on myeloid cells and VM mice have an expanded and activated myeloid/neutrophil
compartment. However, radiation chimera studies have identified a key role for radioresistant cells in lung fibrosis
as lethally irradiated VM mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow stem cells develop extremely severe lung
disease even though these chimeras completely lack any VM-derived hematopoietic cells. Preliminary data
implicate lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) as initiators of BALT formation in VM mice. The goal of this
application is to further explore the radioresistant innate immune cells that are directly or indirectly activated by
the VM mutation and define the mechanisms by which these cells promote lung inflammation. Our approach will
involve: (1) the in vivo analysis of a novel VM conditional KI line crossed to endothelial-restricted Cre deleter
strains and other relevant controls, (2) scRNAseq comparison of stromal populations including lymphatic and
vascular endothelial cells isolated from WT and VM mice; and (3) analysis of endothelial cells from VM and WT
mice following in vitro activation by the VM mutation or more conventional STING agonists. There is an urgent
need to identify better therapies for patients afflicted with autoimmune and autoinflammatory lung disorders and
the studies proposed in this application should provide critical insights that will enable us to design the most
relevant therapeutic targets. Further, these studies provide an opportunity to study the impact of STING
activation on stromal cell types more generally, an emerging area of research as STING activity in endothelial
cells has recently been linked to the development of severe COVID19."

Prion disease is a uniquely rapid, universally fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease of humans and other
mammals. It arises from a single protein, the native prion protein (PrP), which is capable of post-translationally
misfolding into a self-templating and deadly “prion.” Genetic and pharmacological proofs of concept
increasingly identify PrP dosage as the key to understanding, and ultimately intercepting this pathogenic
cascade. In mice with genetically altered PrP levels, lower PrP levels lead to longer survival following prion
infection, while excess PrP hastens disease. PrP-lowering antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) now show
promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, effective implementation will hinge on a deeper
understanding of how PrP level controls the rates of prion nucleation, replication and neurotoxicity, and how
this control translates across disease timepoints, species and strains. Though almost all human prion disease
originates in the brain, PrP-lowering interventions have not yet been tested in spontaneous, rather than
inoculated, prion models. Meanwhile, the magnitude of protection conveyed by 50% genetic PrP reduction can
vary between model systems; the relative contributions of slowed prion replication and slowed neurotoxicity to
observed survival benefit in different species and prion strains remain to be disentangled. Finally, PrP lowering
must be studied in the context of patient-derived human prions, to assess how above learnings extrapolate to
strains of public health interest. We will fill these gaps by assessing the following. 1) Kinetics of spontaneous
prion formation. Using a new mouse model of spontaneous prion disease, we will track the spontaneously
disease process through serial molecular measurements of neuronal damage and prion seeding activity.
Through PrP-lowering tool compounds administered at different timepoints, we will disentangle how PrP
dosage modulates prion formation, amplification, neurotoxicity and symptomatic progression. 2) Rapid and
slow prion subtypes as a function of PrP dosage. Using newly engineered PrP knockout hamster and rat
models, we will characterize the kinetics of pathological biomarker rise relative to disease onset and terminal
illness as a function of PrP expression level in both canonically rapid (hamster) and more slowly progressive
(rat) prion disease systems. 3) Impact of PrP lowering on human prions. Using a series of novel
“humanized” mouse lines expressing human PrP at six different dosage levels, that have been shown
susceptible to multiple clinically relevant human prion strains, we will characterize time to pathology, symptom
onset, and terminal illness. PrP level will be varied on a lifelong basis through genetically manipulation, as well
as through postnatal, precisely timed intervention with PrP-lowering tool compounds. Taken together, these
studies will illuminate PrP’s control of disease kinetics across a spectrum of prion disease paradigms, while
building a scientific foundation to guide future development of PrP-lowering therapeutics."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is caused by atherosclerosis in the lower extremities which leads to a
spectrum of life-altering symptomatology, including claudication, ischemic rest pain, and gangrene requiring
limb amputation. Complicating the etiology of PAD, patients typically present with comorbid conditions or risk
factors that accelerate disease evolution and substantially worsen pathology contributing to increased mortality
risk. Among these, chronic kidney disease (CKD) accelerates the development of atherosclerosis, decreases
functional capacity, and increases risk of amputation or death, however the underlying biologic mechanism(s)
are poorly understood and vastly understudied compared with other comorbidities (i.e. smoking and diabetes).
We have uncovered a novel molecular pathway that may link CKD and PAD pathobiology. We find that many
uremic metabolites, which accumulate in CKD, cause chronic activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
which leads to disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport system that exacerbates ischemic muscle
injury and impairs angiogenesis. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that genetic knockdown of the AHR is
protective against uremic toxicity, whereas expression of a constitutively active AHR causes mitochondrial
dysfunction. Thus, we propose to test the novel hypothesis that the chronic activation of the AHR pathway
results in ischemic muscle injury and impaired angiogenesis, thereby linking CKD and PAD pathobiology. This
hypothesis will be tested using muscle- and vascular-specific inducible knockout of the AHR as well as adeno-
associated virus-mediated expression of the a constitutively active AHR in pre-clinical models of CKD/PAD.
Finally, our recent human data indicate elevated AHR signaling in PAD patients with CKD. We propose to
extend these findings to establish a clinical link between muscle health/function, mitochondrial energetics, and
AHR signaling in human PAD patients. Success in these studies will provide mechanistic insight into the
impact of CKD on PAD pathobiology, and would provide a novel target for therapeutic development aimed to
treat a patient population that currently has few available options."
10745654,"Atherosclerosis is a narrowing of arteries caused by plaque buildup. Dyslipidemia, especially elevated low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic plaque formation. Current therapies for
atherosclerosis focus on lowering cholesterol. However, conventional lipid lowering therapies (such as statins)
are associated with obvious side effects. Developing more specific and efficient treatments are needed.
Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) has been widely studied for its therapeutic benefits in cardiovascular disorders
primary utilization of its mitogenic functions. Recently, FGF1 was shown to exert an unexpected metabolic activity
by regulating adipose remodeling and glucose homeostasis, demonstrating a potential for treatment of metabolic
syndrome. However, wild-type FGF1 (FGF1WT) induced hyperproliferation can lead to increased tumorigenic risk;
this becomes the primary obstacle for its widespread application. To reduce this risk, we recently engineered a
partial FGF1 agonist carrying triple mutations of the heparin-binding sites (FGF1ΔHBS), which abolished
proliferative potential, but maintains full FGF1WT metabolic activity. Notably, chronic treatment of db/db mice with
FGF1ΔHBS almost completely reversed diabetes-associated NAFLD. These findings suggest that FGF1ΔHBS is a
potentially safe and efficient therapeutic approach for treatment of metabolic syndrome.
Although characterization of the metabolic functions of FGF1 is ongoing, little is known about its roles in
atherosclerosis. A small case observation found an increased FGF1 expression in neovascularized and
macrophage-rich regions of plaque, implying a potential pathological role of FGF1 in human atherogenesis.
However, whether and how FGF1 plays beneficial or detrimental roles in atherogenesis remain unexplored. We
recently examined the impact of FGF1 administration on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in ApoE-KO mice
and found that FGF1ΔHBS markedly ameliorated atherosclerotic phenotypes without significant proliferative
potential in liver. Furthermore, FGF1 treatment reduced cholesterol levels in the blood, liver and intestine, but
increased cholesterol contents in feces. These preliminary data indicate that FGF1 regulation of cholesterol
homeostasis in both liver and intestine is responsible for its protection from atherosclerosis. The liver is a major
site for cholesterol biosynthesis while the intestine maintains cholesterol homeostasis by mediating intestinal
absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. Therefore, we hypothesize that non-mitogenic variant FGF1ΔHBS
prevents atherosclerosis by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis and suppressing intestinal
cholesterol absorption without risks of hyperproliferation. We will test the hypothesis in three specific aims:
1) Determine the roles of FGF1 in the development of atherosclerosis; 2) Determine the effects and mechanism
of FGF1 on hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis; 3) Determine the effects and mechanism of FGF1 on intestinal
cholesterol absorption. This project will provide fundamental evidence for FGF1ΔHBS acting at the hepatocytes
and intestinal enterocytes as a novel approach for the prevention of atherosclerosis in future clinical studies."

Carbohydrates have been used in some of the world most effective glycoconjugate
vaccines. However, traditional glycoconjuates produced by oligosaccharide isolation
have failed to produce effective vaccines against the ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. ESKAPE pathogens are pathogens that have acquired extensive
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and are becoming increasingly difficult and in some
cases impossible to treat. There is an urgent need to identity new approaches for
controlling AMR which is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually and cost
100 trillion dollars in cumulative economic damage by the year 2050. This application
addresses AMR by using a powerful soluble polymer-based synthetic method to
chemically synthesize serotype-independent oligosaccharide epitopes from the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of P. aeruginosa bacteria. In addition, we develop robust
methods to site-specifically conjugate these synthetic oligosaccharide domains with
protective fusion protein domains prepared by synthetic biology-based methods. We
develop methods to further site-specifically conjugate these glycoconjugates with lipid
adjuvants to form well-defined single molecule lipoglycoproteins. These materials will be
used to determine the beneficial role of both the oligosaccharide and the protein in
provoking a protective immune response. In addition, the work will allow mapping of the
protective oligosaccharide and protein epitopes. The antigens are designed to overcome
known obstacles to development of a protective immune response against this
bacterium and to provide protection against multiple bacterial strains. A second aspect of
the proposal is the systematic study of the resulting conjugates in mice that will lead to
new approaches to enhance vaccine immunogenicity in humans. The approach takes
advantage of naturally occurring antibodies in humans that can participate in enhancing
the recognition of the vaccine by the immune system. This proposal takes advantage of
a collaboration between investigators trained in organic chemistry, immunology, and
molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent b-thalassemia (TDT) are severe, prevalent blood disorders
for which fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction can bypass the fundamental hemoglobin defects and hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation (HSCT) offers curative potential. Allogeneic and autologous trans-
plant approaches can succeed, nonetheless, the short- and long-term toxicities of genotoxic alkylating chemo-
therapy-based conditioning regimens remain a substantial barrier to the widespread application of curative HSCT
for SCD and TDT. Immunotherapies targeting HSPC antigens have been proposed as a safer conditioning strat-
egy, however the pharmacokinetics of these agents currently hamper their clinical efficacy. The long-term goal
of our proposal is to address this unmet medical need by developing an effective, novel strategy for the engraft-
ment and progressive enrichment of autologous gene modified HSPCs in SCD and TDT by coupling non-geno-
toxic immunotherapy-based myeloablation with epitope-engineering. Our central hypothesis is that precise
multiplexed base editing of HbF determinants and targeted epitopes within HSPCs can endow hematopoietic
lineages with both HbF induction capacity and selective resistance to monoclonal Abs or CAR-T cells without
affecting protein function or regulation (so-called stealth status). We have identified defined minimal amino-acid
changes within the extracellular domains (ECD) of the cytokine receptors KIT, FLT3 and IL3RA, each expressed
in long-term repopulating HSCs, that abrogate recognition by therapeutic Abs while preserving physiologic
responses to stimulation with their respective ligands. Here, we will capitalize on these results and further expand
the reach of these innovative genetic engineering tools with the objectives to i) generate “stealth” g-globin
derepressed HSPCs by multiplex CRISPR-Cas base-editing; ii) validate efficacy of this approach on suitable
pre-clinical models of b-hemoglobinopathy, and iii) further optimize and scale the manufacturing process for
production of efficiently and precisely engineered cellular products suitable to progress to the clinic. We aim: 1)
to optimize multiplex base editing approaches to simultaneously derepress HbF and engineer stealth HSPC
epitopes that will generate immunotherapy resistant hematopoietic stem cells capable of ameliorating sickling
and globin chain imbalance in SCD and TDT patient erythroid cells; 2) to maximize the engraftment of edited
HSCs by optimizing immunotherapy regimens to enrich multiplex edited HSPCs through modeling parameters
for therapeutic selection of edited HSPCs, and thereby obtaining proof-of-concept chemotherapy-free engraft-
ment and selection of edited patient HSPCs; and 3) to identify conditions that produce efficient on-target base
edits without measurable off-targets at clinical scale. This project will provide fundamental advancement of a
new chemotherapy-free gene therapy approach to HSCT for hemoglobinopathies that should additionally have
broad applicability to other hematopoietic disorders."

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer enormous potential for understanding human myogenesis and
modeling diseases in a dish. In the previous funding period, we have identified the developmental trajectory of
skeletal muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs) derived from hPSCs to be around embryonic to fetal week 7-12 stage
in human development. We showed that SMPCs do not engraft into the mouse niche efficiently whereas adult
muscle stem cells (SCs) have this robust potential. Further as disease severity increases in mdx mouse models
of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy we found an increase in aberrant cells in the microenvironment altering robust
engraftment. The next phase of this work in this proposal is now focused on improving our ability to modulate
SMPC and SC states and improve engraftment into the mouse niche as true repopulating stem cells. By using
human development as a model, our work has already yielded significant insights into our understanding of
human myogenesis and the generation of myogenic cells. We will utilize the tools, sequencing datasets and
knowledge gained in the previous funding period to modulate SMPC and SC states and generate a better
therapeutic candidate in this renewal. We will define and functionally validate the key regulatory networks
important for controlling embryonic, fetal SMPCs, or adult SCs and improve our basic knowledge of how
progenitors and stem cells change over time during human myogenesis and from hPSCs (Aim 1). Further we
will evaluate the parameters important for modulating niche occupancy from hPSC SMPCs (Aim 2). This work
will improve our ability to generate a robust stem cell for improved disease modeling and use in regenerative
medicine."

 Through the research and training described in this K23 proposal, the PI (Dr. Helseth) will acquire the
necessary skills to become an independent clinical researcher focused on designing and evaluating early,
substance use (SU) interventions for youth on risky developmental trajectories. Marijuana (MJ) use accounts
for 92% of positive drug screens among teens in the juvenile justice system (JJ) and has been linked to future
arrests and SU disorders. Due to JJ capacity constraints, court-involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) youth are
often referred out for treatment and encounter multiple barriers to community care. Technology-assisted
interventions would enable the JJ system to treat CINI youth in-house, without overextending its workforce or
resources. Brief, computerized motivational interventions are inexpensive and easy to deliver, and have been
shown to reduce teens’ MJ and SU. However, effects typically fade after a few months, indicating the need for
an adjunct intervention to sustain behavior change. Smartphone apps are an ideal treatment platform for teens:
95% of teens own one, which they use nearly 3 hours each day. Yet the potential of smartphone apps as a
means of reducing MJ use in high-risk youth has not been realized. With this 5-year K23, the PI aims to
establish the needs and preferences of CINI youth ages 14-17 for an adjunctive smartphone app; examine the
app’s feasibility and acceptability; and establish its preliminary efficacy. The Teen Empowerment through
Computerized Health (TECH) app, which targets putative intrapersonal and interpersonal mechanisms to
promote MJ-related behavior change, will serve as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in the Rhode Island
Family Court. Following the Behavior Intervention Theory (BIT) model, qualitative interviews with key
stakeholders (n=30) will inform how clinical goals (knowledge, skills, motivation) will map on to TECH usage
goals (goal-setting, peer networking), features (expert-moderated forum, notifications) and workflow. Next, 10
CINI youth will beta test the TECH prototype for 1 month, to guide its refinement. Finally, a pilot randomized
control trial with 60 CINI youth will test the app for 6 months as an adjunct to TAU (TAU+TECH vs. TAU-only)
on MJ and other SU-related outcomes, putative mechanisms of change (i.e., intrapersonal and interpersonal
factors), and high-risk behaviors. The PI will work with an accomplished, multidisciplinary mentorship team
(Drs. Spirito, Barnett, Becker, and Clark) to master four relevant areas of training: 1) effective MJ and SU
interventions for CINI youth; 2) interpersonal mechanisms of adolescent SU; 3) development of technology-
assisted behavioral interventions; and 4) qualitative methods for treatment development. The research and
training activities outlined in this K23 award contribute to both an important public health concern and the
development of a productive and independent research career for the PI. Completion of this study has the
potential to advance the field by demonstrating the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an
adjunct technology-assisted intervention to improve outcomes among high-risk, MJ-using CINI youth."

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that poses a major threat to public health and is responsible for an enormous
economic and social burden. While some antiepileptic drugs have proven beneficial for the treatment of seizures,
they mainly provide symptomatic relief from seizures and often cause serious adverse effects. Thus, the
development of novel treatment strategies is of crucial importance. Here we focus on the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), which functions via two distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, and whose dysfunction
has been associated with epilepsy. Based largely on studies utilizing chronic treatment with the drug rapamycin,
it is currently believed that hyperactivation of mTORC1 leads to abnormal network rhythmicity associated with
epilepsy. However, chronic rapamycin treatment also inhibits the activity of mTORC2. Thus, it remains unclear
whether hyperactivation of mTORC1 or mTORC2 leads to the abnormal synchronized neuronal firing during
epilepsy. The goal of this new application is to define the mechanism by which activation of mTOR signaling
leads to epilepsy, with a special emphasis on mTORC2. In Aim 1, we will use molecular genetics to define the
role of mTOR complexes in seizures. In Aim 2, using phosphoproteomics, genetic, pharmacology and in utero
electroporation experiments, we will examine the mechanism by which inhibition of mTORC2 reduces seizures.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will use a novel selective and efficient inhibitor of mTORC2 and assess its broader
therapeutic potential for the suppression of seizures in different models of epilepsy."

Kratom use is common among polydrug users, including persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The botanical
is gaining in popularity due to its psychoactive and opioid properties. Its use has become an important safety
issue; and federal databases have linked kratom to multiple deaths. Kratom comes from the leaves of Mitragyna
speciosa, is legal in many states, widely available, and used by over 13 million U.S. consumers. These data plus
the bioactivity of its major compound, mitragynine, suggest kratom has the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK)
interactions with HIV antiretroviral therapies (ART), widely prescribed for PLWHA. PK interactions between drugs
used for HIV ART, toxicity, and/or lack of ART efficacy result if kratom inhibits or induces Phase I metabolizing
enzymes (particularly the cytochromes P450 [CYPs]). Limited studies demonstrated concerning interactions
between kratom and CYPs but, to date, highly potent kratom dosages have not been evaluated for any PK drug
interactions. Our multi-institutional team from Auburn University and Oregon State University proposes to fill this
knowledge gap by combining our specialized expertise to evaluate the hypothesis that kratom has PK
interactions with HIV ART drugs mediated by CYPs. Preclinical studies will address this hypothesis in two specific
aims: Aim 1 will assay botanically-authenticated kratom extract and mitragynine for inhibition of human hepatic
Phase I CYPs that metabolize HIV ART drugs. To determine a mechanism of action, kratom preparations and
compounds that inhibit specific CYPs will be re-assayed in combination with the widely used first- and second-
line HIV ART drug regimens, and the apparent and total intrinsic clearances calculated. To account for the
displacement of HIV ART drugs from plasma proteins (e.g., human serum albumin) which can also cause kratom-
drug interactions, rapid equilibrium dialysis and LC-MS/MS will measure the binding of each kratom alkaloid to
human plasma proteins (from pooled donors). The serum protein binding of HIV ART drugs will also be
determined for comparison. Aim 2 will assay kratom extract and compounds for induction of human hepatocyte
CYPs that metabolize HIV ART drugs. To determine the extent of any PK interactions, active extract or
compound will be re-tested with first- and second-line HIV ART drugs that are substrates for the CYP enzyme,
and calculate the apparent intrinsic clearance. The anticipated outcome of this study is a quantitative evaluation
of PK drug interactions between kratom and HIV ART CYP substrates. These data should provide a fundamental
understanding of PK interactions between HIV ART and kratom and a rationale for future confirmatory clinical
trials and approaches to improve the safety and efficacy of HIV ART among kratom users. Ultimately, insight
from this study should improve education and knowledge-sharing among patients and clinicians."

Junior scientists from underrepresented groups (URGs) face major barriers to academic career success that
junior scientists who are not from URGs do not face. There is an opportunity and a responsibility for academic
units with strength in nutrition, obesity, and diabetes to develop programs that help overcome these barriers and
enhance the careers of researchers who are part of URGs. Additionally, we need trained researchers from URGs
in order to fully understand and address obesity-related chronic diseases in these groups in the population. This
is particularly a problem in Alabama and surrounding Deep South states. We propose to develop, implement,
and evaluate an innovative program to help junior scientists from URGs identify and overcome barriers to
academic success and enhance their academic, mentoring, and political skills. We have a strong pipeline of T32
training grants at pre- and postdoctoral levels to bring scientists from URGs to UAB and strong commitments
from units within UAB to create faculty positions (and/or retention packages) for those who complete the program.
The specific aims are: 1) To engage the participation of at least three cohorts of 3-4 junior scientists
(postdoctoral fellows, assistant professors), preferably from URGs to spend 3 years each in a program
aimed to enhance and develop skills for success as a independent researcher/principal investigator in
academia, 2) To provide a 3-year educational and mentoring program that will focus on the development
of intrapersonal, interpersonal and team-development skills, 3) To establish mentoring teams for each
program participant that include a scientist mentors, academic/institutional navigators, and a wellness
coach, and 4) To develop a comprehensive plan for evaluating and potentially expanding the program.
UAB provides the perfect environment for supporting the career development of scientists from URGs. UAB was
named (by Forbes magazine) the 4th best employer in the country for diversity. UAB has a strong Department
of Nutrition Sciences (DNS) that houses three NIH-funded centers – the Nutrition Obesity Research Center
(NORC), the Nutrition for Precision Health Clinical Center (NPHCC) and the Diabetes Research Center (DRC).
The School of Health Professions houses a CDC-funded National Center on Health, Physical Activity and
Disability (NCHPAD). This application is supported by the institution and promises the consideration to hire
scholars participating in the program. Our innovative training program was delivered to address specific barriers
to career success that were identified in a UAB NORC–led national workshop series on facilitating the careers
of those underrepresented in academic (URiA). Innovative aspects of this proposal include a mentoring team to
facilitate research but also to help participants develop other skills for advancement and success within academic
institutions."

Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders are devastating disorders thought to arise from a combination of
synaptic dysfunction and altered neural progenitor modulation for which there are no effective treatments. Mutations or
deletions in one allele of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) result in MEF2C Haploinsufficiency Syndrome (MHS), a
disorder characterized by a severe phenotype with intellectual disability, repetitive motor behaviors, and difficulties with
communication and social interaction on the autism spectrum. We have found that MEF2C is highly expressed in human
microglia during neurodevelopment and have identified MEF2C as a core transcription factor involved in the microglial
cell fate. Furthermore, MEF2C expression is regulated by the brain environment and decreases during aging. Microglia
have not been extensively investigated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, but there is increasing evidence
for their impact on brain development suggesting they may contribute to especially the social and behavioral deficits in
autism. The central hypothesis is that microglial MEF2C has a crucial role in human brain development and contributes
to neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability and autism pathogenesis and the resulting behavioral
phenotype. We will utilize novel in vitro and in vivo methods to ascertain the role of microglial MEF2C in brain
development including synapse retention and pruning, modulation of the neural progenitor pool, and microglial
development. The project goal is to test the hypothesis that MEF2C specifically in human microglia contributes to brain
development and reduced expression contributes to neurodevelopmental deficits found in intellectual disability and autism.
Delineating MEF2C transcriptional and environmental targets using epigenetic techniques will yield novel insight into
human microglial transcriptional networks and expand on our knowledge of autism associated genes with the potential to
yield novel therapeutic targets. The long-term goal is to generate and validate methods using human microglia specifically
which can be utilized for drug screening and to generate preclinical data in order to ultimately identify novel potential
therapeutic targets to improve the outcomes for children with autism."
10755705,"MDMX and MDM2 are homologues that regulate the p53 tumor suppressor using different
mechanisms. While MDM2 is responsible for controlling p53 degradation, MDMX regulates p53 DNA
binding and transcriptional activities. MDMX overexpression occurs in a subset of human tumors leading
to inactivation of p53. Efficient p53 response to stress and DNA damage involves phosphorylation of
MDMX followed by release of p53. Successful targeting of the p53 pathway for cancer therapy requires
understanding how MDMX regulates p53 function. MDMX contains an ordered p53 binding domain and
RING domain, and two long disordered regions that regulate p53 and CK1α binding in a phosphorylation-
dependent manner. Our work identified intra- and intermolecular interactions essential for MDMX
functions: (1) MDMX/p53 interaction inhibits p53 DNA binding. (2) MDMX/MDM2 interaction promotes
MDMX degradation. (3) MDMX/14-3-3 interaction promotes MDMX nuclear translocation. (4)
MDMX/CK1α interaction promotes MDMX/p53 binding and inhibition of p53. (5) MDMX intramolecular
interaction regulates p53 binding. Importantly, these interactions are regulated by two phosphorylation
sites (S289, S367) located in intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) of MDMX. We hypothesize that the
coordinated control is mediated by intramolecular interactions between ordered and disordered regions of
MDMX. The IDRs regulate the switching of intra/inter-molecular contacts in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. We propose integrated molecular biology and biophysics approach to elucidate the mechanism
of MDMX regulation: (1) Determine how the length and flexibility of MDMX IDR1 regulates auto-
inhibition of p53 binding. (2) Investigate how CK1α phosphorylation switches MDMX to an open
conformation that inhibits p53 DNA binding. (3) Determine how Chk2 phosphorylation of IDR2
S367 regulates multiple MDMX interactions. These experiments will significantly advance the
understanding of how stress signals activate p53 by targeting disordered regions of MDMX, which is
essential to develop MDMX inhibitors for cancer therapy."

Building comprehensive accounts of human brain development from childhood to early adulthood is crucial to
our understanding of both healthy neurodevelopment and the mechanisms underlying threats to youths’ mental
health. Brain development unfolds on multiple levels, but the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of
whether the trajectories of development are fundamentally similar or different across modalities (e.g., structure
and function), and how they reflect developmental mechanisms associated with puberty or age (or both). The
proposed research aims to generate a systematic and comprehensive multimodal account of typical
neurodevelopment from ages 5 to 21, with a particular focus on a) identifying age versus pubertal- and
hormonal-based mechanisms that undergird development in childhood and adolescence; b) systematic
analyses across brain structure, function, and connectivity using state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis
approaches; and c) evaluation of maturational variation in multimodal coupling across brain systems/
modalities as a function of development. Once established, this multimodal model of typical neurodevelopment
will be used to test a conceptual model proposing that early pubertal timing leads to intensification of
internalizing symptoms due to disruptions in brain development, including alterations in multimodal coupling.
Specifically, models of the impact of early pubertal timing predict either further enhanced coupling with early
puberty (neurodevelopmental acceleration) or disruptions in coupling due to neurodevelopmental delays. To
compare these competing models and advance our understanding of the neurodevelopmental pathways by
which early pubertal timing contributes to the rise of internalizing symptoms during adolescence, the research
will use both hypothesis-driven methods and novel validated analysis pipelines for data-driven exploration of
developmental changes in coupling, with careful attention to robustness and replication. The primary dataset
will be the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCPD), a large, NIH funded, multimodal brain
imaging dataset that includes a comprehensive assessment of brain structure, function, and connectivity paired
with pubertal and hormonal measures and extensive behavioral and clinical measures in both a cross-sectional
cohort of N=1300+ youth ages 5 to 21, and a longitudinal cohort (N=252) spanning ages 9 to 17 capturing the
pubertal transition. This sample is purposefully strong diversity in race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
Key findings will be replicated to ensure robustness and generalizability in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive
Development (ABCD) longitudinal study. Our Specific Aims are to: A1) Establish a comprehensive, systematic
account of age-and pubertal-linked pathways of brain development across multiple modalities of brain structure
and function; A2) Test hypotheses about the relations of age and pubertal development to coupling across
brain modalities; and A3) Test hypotheses about the neurodevelopmental mechanisms contributing to the rise
in internalizing symptoms during the pubertal transition."
10755200,"Preeclampsia (PE) a disease estimated to affect 12% of deliveries at University of Mississippi Medical
Center. The incidence of PE deliveries increased significantly at our hospital due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rate of PE at UMMC rose from 12% to 28% in December of 2020 and was up to 42 % in April of 2021. PE
is characterized by placental ischemia, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, hypertension
(HTN), IUGR and developmental origins of HTN in the offspring. We have shown that agonistic autoantibodies
to the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1-AA) stimulate to cause placental and cerebral dysfunction contributing
to HTN in pregnant rats which is attenuated by blockade of the AT1-AA with the peptide ‘n7AAc’. One important
unanswered question in PE research is the relative importance of B cells secreting AT1-AA to cause HTN and
cerebral dysfunction in the pregnant mom or to cause adult HTN in her offspring. A second important unanswered
question is does the sex of the baby correlate with immune cell (B cell) activation, level of AT1-AA and HTN
during pregnancy or in adult offspring. Moreover, we don’t know the role of B cells to secrete the AT1-AA as
mechanisms of a PE phenotype in pregnant patients with a history (Hx) of COVID 19 infection. Our preliminary
data supporting AIM 1 are that AT1-AA are elevated in response to PE and in Normal pregnant adoptive transfer
recipients of PE B cells. In addition, we show that postpartum (PP) AT1-AA induced hypertensive pregnant rats
exhibit cerebrovascular dysfunction 4 months PP. Preliminary data supporting AIM 2 is that adoptive transfer of
PE B cells cause HTN and AT1-AA in pregnant athymic nude recipient rats. Preliminary data supporting AIM 3
is that AT1-AA is produced in pregnant women with HTN and a history (Hx) of COVID during pregnancy and that
adoptive transfer of B cells from PE women with a COVID 19 Hx during pregnancy increases blood pressure
and AT1-AA in pregnant nude athymic recipient rats compared to B cells from normotensive women with a Hx
of COVID during pregnancy. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that PE stimulated B cells secreting AT1-
AA cause cerebral dysfunction and HTN during pregnancy and programming of HTN in adult male and female
offspring which could be attenuated by AT1-AA blockade. Moreover, we hypothesize that a COVID 19 Hx during
pregnancy results in AT1-AA that causes a PE phenotype during pregnancy which could be attenuated with AT1-
AA blockade. Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that perinatal AT1-AA results HTN, cerebrovascular
dysfunction and cognitive decline in the dam and in adult male or female offspring. Specific Aim 2. To test the
hypothesis that B2 cells secreting AT1-AA from PE women cause cerebral dysfunction and HTN during
pregnancy and in adult male and female offspring. Does sex of the baby influence the activation of the placental
B2 cells and levels of AT1-AA from PE women? Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that B2 cells from
PE+COVID-19 Hx patients cause AT1AA, cerebral dysfunction, IUGR, and HTN recipient pregnant rats. Does
sex of the baby influence the activation of the placental B2 cells and levels of AT1-AA from PE women?"

 The goal of this proposal is to optimize and clinically validate a new diagnostic test for eosinophilic chronic
rhinosinusitis (eCRS) at the point-of-care, improving the efficiency, value, and accessibility of personalized
medicine. eCRS affects up to 5 million Americans and is characterized by varying degrees of sinonasal and
peripheral eosinophilia, linked to treatment responsiveness in CRS. This predominantly type 2 inflammatory
disease leads to significant declines in patient quality of life and imposes an annual economic burden of greater
than $5.7B. Patients with eCRS typically fail the standard of care and turn to costly surgical intervention and
eosinophil-targeting biologic therapies to manage their disease. Moreover, these patients have significant
sinonasal symptoms despite aggressive medical management and are more likely to undergo revision sinus
surgery compared to other CRS cohorts. A definitive diagnosis of eCRS currently relies on meeting a sinonasal
tissue eosinophil count threshold obtained through surgical biopsy and pathologic examination, limiting
diagnoses to patients electing sinus surgery after medical treatment failure, with no potential to assess changes
in eosinophilia over time. Given the difficulty in controlling eCRS disease and that tissue eosinophilia is correlated
to treatment responsiveness, an accurate and reliable diagnosis of eCRS is critical, as it may have prognostic
and therapeutic implications for patients. GlycoMira is developing a minimally invasive, cost-effective, and timely
diagnostic solution based on a sinonasal swab and detection of an immunologic marker of tissue eosinophilia to
improve the treatment management and outcomes for patients with eCRS. A pilot study in patients demonstrated
that this test is capable of confirming a clinical diagnosis of eCRS within 25 minutes and with high sensitivity and
moderate specificity, suggesting that this test has a high potential to accurately predict a diagnosis of eCRS, as
well as serve as an objective tool by which to measure patient response to medical and surgical intervention. In
this proposal, the tissue eosinophil detection assay will be optimized and validated in patients using sinonasal
swabs that were specifically engineered to improve patient sampling precision and reliability, as well as assay
specificity for accurately confirming a diagnosis of eCRS in Aim 1. A prospective observational cohort study will
be performed to assess the clinical utility of this new test method to predict a diagnosis of eCRS at the point-of-
care in Aim 2. Test parameters will be optimized to minimize readout time and improve test specificity and
positive predictive value by comparing sinonasal swab results obtained from clinically diagnosed patients with
eCRS to those from patients with non-eCRS. Milestone achievements will result in the submission of a Phase II
proposal to expand test validation studies, obtain Premarket Notification 510(k) clearance, and conduct large-
scale manufacturing of eCRS test kits towards the commercialization of a point-of-care test for diagnosing and
monitoring eCRS."

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) is a severe and debilitating nerve dysfunction prevalent in over
30 million US diabetic patients. It adversely affects patients by causing sensory pain in the lower limbs,
muscular weakness, predisposition to falls, decreased quality of life, and significant patient morbidity as a
result of foot ulcerations, amputations, and disability. pDPN is estimated to cost $10.9 billion per year in the
US alone, with most costs attributed to the treatment of foot ulcers and superimposed infections.
Treatment for pDPN remains limited despite the significant economic and medical impact on patients and
the U.S. healthcare system. Established guidelines advocate the use of therapies targeting the symptoms of
pDPN, and may include administration of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and opioids, as first-line therapies.
Yet, these therapies only offer moderate pain relief, with adverse events outweighing pain reduction. The FDA
has approved virtually no new categories of analgesics for the treatment of neuropathic pain over the last two
decades, creating a gaping hole in the development of effective and safe pDPN-specific alternative therapies.
This project introduces a significant innovation in the treatment of pDPN through our clinically-demonstrated
novel water-solubilized Cannabidiol-Palmitoylethanolamide (CBD-PEA) technology. The formulation avoids
first-pass metabolism and mediates multiple pain pathways to provide the best anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant clinical outcomes. Our CBD-PEA drug may eliminate the adverse effects of current therapies,
therefore allowing all or nearly all pDPN patients to experience pain relief instead of only 50% of the patients.
Pure Green Pharmaceuticals (The Company) has shown preliminary success in published clinical data
demonstrating that sublingual administration of low-dose, water-solubilized sublingual tablets containing CBD
(60 mg/day) and PEA (300 mg/day), to patients with chronic diabetic neuropathy, significantly reduced pain,
improved sleep quality, and reduced anxiety [p< 0.0001 in an open-label trial, N=31]. Similar results were seen
in a confirmatory double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [p<0.0001, N=54]. No adverse events were reported.
The proposed project substantially expands the Company’s capabilities demonstrated in two recently published
foundational Phase 2 clinical trials that strongly suggested clinical and statistical evidence for the efficacy and
safety of CBD-PEA in pDPN.
This study will determine the impact and efficacy of the Company’s water-soluble 20 mg CBD and micronized
100 mg PEA sublingual tablet in patients suffering from pDPN. This Direct-to-Phase II is a milestone-driven
clinical trial to validate the efficacy of PG Pharma’s unique formulation in pDPN reduction, by measuring pain
reduction, patients’ anxiety and sleep quality compared to placebo control. This 12-week randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled decentralized trial will enroll 200 patients across the United States."
10873896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Given the overlapping syndemics of HIV and HIV risk with substance use and the contribution of both HIV
and substance use to chronic inflammation, robust, objective metrics to quantitate the type, amount, and
patterns of substance use are needed. Self‐reported metrics are limited by social desirability bias, where
individuals report behavior desired by the provider or researcher, and recall bias, especially with the use of
memory‐altering substances. The UCSF Hair Analytical Laboratory (HAL) has been involved in developing
objective adherence metrics in the field of HIV for 20 years, showing the utility of analyzing antiretroviral
treatment (ART) levels in hair samples to assess ART and pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and
exposure. The UCSF HAL has also developed hair measures of anti‐tuberculosis (TB) drugs. Given the critical
importance of assessing substance use accurately, and the impact of substances on HIV outcomes, including
inflammation, this proposal aims to direct our laboratory's technical expertise to the field of substance use
monitoring.
 Although available for forensics as qualitative (yes/no) metrics, hair levels assessing quantitative use of
multiple substances have not been widely available for substance use‐HIV studies. Polysubstance use is
common and quantitative multi‐analyte metrics allow impacts on adherence and systemic inflammation to be
assessed. Harnessing an important NIDA‐funded cohort study investigating substance use in those with or at
risk of HIV (the mSTUDY cohort), this proposal aims to develop a suite of hair assays for substances in the
UCSF HAL for NIH‐funded research studies investigating substance use, HIV, and inflammation A single
muti‐analyte panel to simultaneously measure substances (e.g. methamphetamines, different opiates, cocaine,
cannabis, tobacco, and others) will allow intentional or unintentional polysubstance use to be quantitated.
 The mSTUDY has enrolled a biobehavioral cohort since 2013 of over 500 young men who have sex with
men (MSM) of color, half as active substance users (279 with and 278 without HIV) in Los Angeles. The robust
specimen biorepository of mSTUDY contains 76,000 biological samples, with 1115 hair samples from 319
mSTUDY participants who report use of methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and/or
cannabis. Hair sample collection was initiated in August 2014 and is ongoing. These hair samples will serve as
the basis of developing and validating the methods for a multi‐analyte panel of substances in hair in the
UCSF HAL (Aim 1); analyzing the relationship between hair levels and self‐reported adherence measures,
urine toxicology screens, and clinical outcomes (Aim 2); and assessing the relationship between hair levels (of
single or multiple substances) and biomarkers of inflammation (Aim 3). Via this proposal, the UCSF HAL
aims to become the reference laboratory to provide quantitative, objective metrics of substance use
exposure in hair samples for multiple studies examining the interaction between substance use and HIV."

Frequent HIV testing among persons at increased HIV risk is crucial for achieving early diagnosis and prompt
antiretroviral therapy initiation – key steps to reducing morbidity and eliminating transmission. HIV retesting can
also support ongoing efforts to scale-up pre-exposure prophylaxis. Despite guidelines recommending frequent
retesting among adults at higher risk, studies from sub-Saharan Africa suggest that retesting occurs
infrequently.
Behavioral economics provides insights into why people may not engage in behaviors like HIV retesting. Low
HIV retesting stems from structural factors (e.g. stigma and opportunity costs), as well as various biases and
heuristics in people’s beliefs and behavior, constraints in attention, and reliance on incorrect mental models.
Behavioral economics has also identified low-cost interventions (“nudges”) that effectively account for these
features of behavior. Building on our prior work that has identified barriers to HIV retesting, we have applied a
Behavioral Design framework to select nudges that are effective in addressing the psychological underpinnings
of each barrier to retesting. We will adapt the nudges to HIV retesting and local contexts through a participatory
prototyping approach that brings together scientists and end users. We will then conduct a large-scale, multi-
arm field experiment that features individual randomization and tests many different nudges. This “mega-trial”
approach has recently been used to test behavioral interventions to promote other health behaviors in the US
and offers many advantages over standard experiments that only test 1 or 2 interventions. With the same
outcome being examined in all study arms, mega-trials allow for direct comparison of different interventions.
Unlike 2-arm experiments, they also make it possible to identify which interventions work best for whom.
Leveraging the infrastructure of the SAPPHIRE trial of novel HIV biomedical prevention and treatment
approaches in Kenya and Uganda, we will enroll a large study population of persons at high risk of HIV to
conduct a mega-trial of low-cost behavioral interventions to promote HIV retesting. The project will have the
following aims:
AIM 1. Adapt behavioral economics interventions to promote HIV retesting using a participatory prototyping
approach in rural Kenya and Uganda. AIM 2. Determine the effectiveness of many behavioral economics
interventions to promote HIV retesting among high-risk adults in a multi-arm randomized trial. AIM 3. Estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects and identify optimal demand creation interventions.
The research we propose can accelerate the pace of discovery of interventions to increase HIV retesting and
transform future approaches to designing, testing and comparing interventions for health behaviors."

The proposed DE iRED program consists of university and private sector partnerships to deliver a
comprehensive program that will engage and support biomedical innovators in the early stages of technology
commercialization by addressing key bottlenecks in the startup process as identified both in the solicitation and
by the DRIVEN Accelerator Hub. According to DRIVEN’s Voice of Customer interviews regarding challenges to
the commercialization of biomedical innovations, there are 3 main barriers to translating basic science products
that benefit patients, 1) gap in funding between basic research and validation studies required for early-stage
development, 2) lack of knowledge and understanding by innovators about how technologies are brought to
market, and 3) lack of access to sufficient technology development and commercialization resources. The
creation of the IDeA state program is clear evidence of the need for resources not only to cultivate biomedical
research but to spur on commercialization of the new technology created. Correctly identifying deficiencies in
the commercialization pathway and preemptively providing corrective measures will create better entrepreneurs
and increase the likelihood of commercialization. Our team will develop a rigorous and engaging online
curriculum to support the goals and bridge the gap of sufficient training and knowledge for innovators through a
high-availability, scalable, on-demand platform. The platform will help both new and experienced innovators to
focus on areas of need and provide direct learning interventions from ideation, to market assessment, and go-
to-market strategies and will allow for live mentoring and coaching interactions online to support and supplement
the curriculum. Data and advanced insights will be analyzed for both the overall program and the learning
process that will yield trends as to the correlation between innovators who are deemed successful and the parts
of the program leveraged most, allowing us to continuously improve the program. This will result in a more robust
education, an increase in the number of biomedical entrepreneurs, an increase in the number of biomedical
startups developing market-driven technologies applying for SBIR/STTR and accessing existing ecosystem
resources, and increased connectivity between innovative technologies and other enterprises and experts.
 The specific aims align participants and establish the DE iRED organization with deliverables that include
team governance criteria and processes, and innovator roadmaps for Delaware, Northeast, and wider
region/IDeA states.They also include the launch of final program and outreach campaigns (local > northeast)
and programming using data obtained through pilot activities, testing the revenue model and pricing for
sustainability as well as increased reach of the launch outreach campaign to the Northeast and national venue."

I am applying for a K24 renewal with the goal of expanding the scope of my NIH-funded research and expanding
mentorship opportunities at the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership in Botswana. In the past 23 years,
I have built a successful research program in Botswana with a recent focus on adverse birth outcomes
surveillance and novel treatment strategies for children with HIV. I have successfully mentored or co-mentored
nearly 50 young investigators in my career, and my current K24 has been essential for my recent mentoring
activities. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, my K24 research and mentoring aims have been achieved – and
often expanded – over the past 5 years. With re-funding, my K24-supported research will have the following
mentored research aims, which span all of my funded research activities: (1) to evaluate uptake of 6-week HIV
DNA PCR testing, risk factors for lack of testing, and risk factors for HIV vertical transmission in the Botswana
national treatment program; (2) to evaluate the uptake of cabotegravir-LA pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
offered in pregnancy through the Botswana national program; (3) to determine the incidence of maternal
morbidity and mortality associated with cesarean section at Princess Marina Hospital (by HIV status), and
develop interventions to standardize medical indications for caesarean section, while training my current mentee
to become a mentor; and (4) to perform specialized diagnostics and qualitative interviews to optimize a strategy
for a future analytic treatment interruption (ATI) among highly selected children and adolescents living with HIV,
while fostering research independence in a Botswana-based laboratory mentee. My training plan will specifically
expand my expertise in maternal-fetal medicine and HIV cure strategies, and my mentoring plan will involve a
team approach with co-mentors in Boston and Botswana to efficiently utilize opportunities within a new Program
Award, ongoing clinical trials, and existing datasets and specimens. The ultimate goal of my K24 renewal
application is to expand capacity to conduct high-impact patient-oriented research in Botswana by the next
generation of global health leaders from Africa and the United States."

Latin America did not achieve any reductions in new HIV cases in the last decade. In Ecuador, transgender
women—those who identify as women or on the transfeminine spectrum and who were assigned a male sex at
birth—who have sex with cisgender men are a key population in the HIV epidemic. HIV prevalence in Ecuador
is between 20.7%-34.8% among transgender women—the highest in Latin America. Studies are urgently
needed to guide HIV prevention and care efforts to curb HIV Infection rates. People with multiple marginalized
identities, such as transgender women of African descent living in poverty, are at higher risk of exposure to
intersectional discrimination than the general U.S. population and have high rates of HIV. Yet the extent to
which Ecuadorian transgender women are burdened by intersectional discrimination and its effect on the
linkage to HIV prevention and care outcomes remains unknown. This K01 Award will provide the candidate
with training in intersectional qualitative, quantitative, intervention development, and grant writing to address
the challenge of intersectional discrimination and HIV burden in transgender women in Ecuador. The proposed
research will assess the mechanisms through which intersectional discrimination exerts its impact on linkage to
HIV prevention and care for transgender women in Ecuador while extending and deepening candidate’s
research skills. In Research Aim 1, the candidate will assess experiences of intersectional discrimination (e.g.,
HIV stigma, racism, classism) in relation to HIV prevention and care through in-depth qualitative interviews with
transgender women (Training Aim 1: application of intersectionality to qualitative methods). In Research Aim 2,
the candidate will conduct a survey to characterize and longitudinally test the pathways that link intersectional
discrimination with HIV prevention and care linkage outcomes over a 6-month period (Training Aim 2:
epidemiological methods and longitudinal quantitative research design). In Research Aim 3, the candidate will
implement the first six phases of the systematic ADAPT-ITT model to adapt an HIV intervention for
transgender women (Training Aim 3: skills for intervention development). Findings from this study and training
will position the candidate to develop an R01 proposal to implement remaining steps of the ADAPT-ITT model
and conduct a randomized controlled trial of the intervention (Training Aim 4: grant writing). As an Ecuadorian
non-binary queer U.S. immigrant researcher, the candidate has the cultural and research background to
leverage this proposed K01 to transition to career independence and address key knowledge and intervention
gaps for HIV prevention and care in Ecuador."

Novel recombinant Rotavirus vaccine utilizing the probiotic microorganism Lactobacillus acidophilus
Despite the worldwide licensure and availability of two rotavirus vaccines in 2006, it is estimated that rotavirus
kills approximately 215,000 children each year. Children under the age of 5 in developing countries are
significantly more likely to be affected by severe rotavirus disease as the currently available vaccines have lower
efficacy (50-60%) as compared to developed nations (>85%). The ongoing morbidity and mortality as well as the
risk posed by current live-attenuated vaccines, necessitate the development of a next generation human
rotavirus vaccine. We have developed an orally-delivered, mucosal vaccine platform that employs Lactobacillus
acidophilus. We have brought together innovative adjuvant and antigen-expression strategies in unique
constructs with demonstrated potential to induce robust mucosal and systemic immune responses. This platform
offers several important feasibility advantages as it employs a commensal designated as GRAS (generally
regarded as safe) by the FDA, is inexpensive to produce, does not require cold-chain, and is needleless. We will
utilize a novel CRISPR-Cas9 system adapted to L. acidophilus to engineer sophisticated vaccine constructs that
will be tested using a homotypic mouse rotavirus challenge. Induction of homotypic and heterotypic neutralizing
antibodies will be assessed using a novel, highly sensitive assay. We will assess vaccine strain colonization
and potential off-target effects on the microbiome. Finally, we will perform a direct comparison of our rLA
rotavirus vaccine against a human live attenuated vaccine in the gnotobiotic pig model using animals
transplanted with human infant fecal microbiome. Efficacy against human rotavirus challenge will be determined.
At the completion of these proposed studies, we aim to have a rLA construct ready to proceed toward human
clinical trials."

 Soft corals (Alcyonaria) are a remarkable source of natural products (NPs) with pharmaceutically relevant
biological activity, and complex scaffolds that are unique to marine eukaryotes with no terrestrial sources of
structurally related compounds. The composition of secondary metabolites isolated from soft corals is dominated
by a diverse suite of bioactive diterpenes with over 50 unique scaffolds and >1500 unique diterpenoids isolated
to date. Many coral-derived diterpenes have potent and selective biological activity, including the xenicane,
acalycixeniolide F, which displays cytotoxicity against human leukemia cell line K562 (LC50 = 200 ng/mL) via an
undetermined mode of action. However, despite the promise these compounds exhibit as lead structures for the
development of novel medicines, the pharmaceutical potential of coral diterpenes remains untapped as neither
total synthesis nor isolation from aquaculture have provided sufficient material to enable effective in vivo clinical
testing. Through bioinformatic analysis of published soft coral genomes and transcriptomes, our group has
recently identified a series of terpene synthases that synthesize the hydrocarbon backbones of multiple coral-
specific diterpenes, including xeniaphyllene, the precursor to the archetypal coral diterpenes, the xenicanes.
Here, I propose to use the biosynthesis of the xenicanes as model for the development of a sustainable platform
for the microbial production of bioactive coral diterpenes.
 This proposal aims to optimize the production of xenicane diterpenes through characterization and
directed evolution of enzymes involved in the synthesis and oxidation of the xenicane scaffold, culminating in
the reconstitution of xenicane biosynthesis through pathway engineering in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris.
Terpene synthases are often the rate-limiting step in terpenoid biosynthesis due to their low catalytic efficiency
and instability. In Aim 1, I will use a high-throughput, colorimetric substrate competition assay to screen error-
prone PCR-generated xeniaphyllene terpene synthase variants for improved activity and stability. To access the
core scaffold common to all xenicanes, the fused cyclobutane ring in xeniaphyllene must undergo an oxidative
carbon-carbon bond cleavage. In the recently published chromosomal level genome assembly of a Xenia sp.,
we found a suite of cytochromes P450 co-localized with the xeniaphyllene synthase. In Aim 2, I will explore the
oxidative chemistry of these cytochromes P450 in search of the unprecedented carbon–carbon lyase. Finally,
the reconstitution of xenicane biosynthesis will be explored in Aim 3, wherein I will use Universal Loop Assembly
(uLoop) to efficiently design and construct a refactored biosynthetic pathway for fermentative production of
xenicanes in P. pastoris. This research will provide invaluable insights into the enzymology behind the
construction of the biologically active xenicane coral diterpenes. Furthermore, the methods developed from this
work will facilitate the reconstitution of additional marine metazoan biosynthetic pathways, resolving supply
issues for further biological evaluation of these NPs."
10985023,"Project Abstract: Polysomnographic Biomarkers of Brain Aging
Although cognitive decline is a “normal” part of aging, some individuals clearly age better than others.
However, the concept of differential aging has been minimally studied for the brain.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations signals carry rich information regarding brain health and brain aging.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with fragmented sleep and altered sleep oscillations. Clearance of
cerebral beta amyloid through the brain's glymphatic drainage system occurs mainly in non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep, and depends on EEG slow oscillations. Cortical generators of sleep EEG
oscillations overlap with regions of cortical thinning and loss of functional connectivity in AD. Disturbances of
NREM disrupt memory consolidation. Finally, deficient REM sleep contributes to dementia. These observations
suggest that brain health may be measurable from information contained in the sleep EEG.
In preliminary work we have developed EEG-brain age – a machine learning model that predicts a patient’s
age based on patterns of overnight sleeping EEG oscillations. This allows prediction of age with a precision of
+/- 7 years. Our preliminary data suggest diabetes and hypertension, chronic HIV infection, an MCI or AD are
reflected in the EEG as excessive brain age, and that excessive brain age is independently associated with
reduced life expectancy.
Our central hypothesis is that sleep physiology data can provide sensitive and specific biomarkers of brain
health. This hypothesis is based on our prior work showing that BAI is elevated in several clinical populations.
BAI can be accurately calculated using frontal EEG signals, making it suitable for implementation on at-home
EEG devices. The rationale for the proposed research is that validating sleep EEG-derived biomarkers as
measures of brain health at the level of individual patients would lay the ground for use in clinical trials and
patient care. We plan to accomplish the central objective by pursuing two complementary aims. In Aim 1, we
will take a hypothesis-driven approach, and test for associations of specific sleep features with specific
cognitive deficits and specific structural pathology. In Aim 2, we will take ad data-driven approach, and develop
optimized biomarkers of brain health using a novel form of machine learning known as multitask learning,
which combine multiple features of sleep – including conventional features, as well as data-driven features
directly learned from the data – to predict or “explain” variation in cognitive performance and in structural brain
MRI measures that are indicative of brain health or disease. The project will take advantage of a large and
diverse set of sleep data (>33,000 patients), as well as thousands of brain MRI an cognitive testing results.
At the conclusion of this study, we expect to have a better understanding of the role sleep oscillations play in
brain health, and clinically useful brain health biomarkers. These outcomes will aid development of
interventions to promote brain health."

In Kenya, cervical cancer (CC) contributes to over 80% of female reproductive-tract cancers,4 yet only 16.4%
of eligible women are screened for CC.5 This is far below the World Health Organization's (WHO) target if 70%
screening coverage; prioritizing access among women living with HIV given their higher risk of developing CC.
Women who are screened and referred for treatment onsite (precancerous lesions) or off-site (cancerous
lesions) experience high rates of loss to follow up (30-60%) during treatment. Many system and patient level
barriers continue to exist resulting in significant morbidity and mortality that could be prevented. Innovative and
feasible eHealth strategies have improved clinical outcomes and patient retention in low resource settings and
could be key to reaching global targets for CC screening and treatment coverage in Kenya. To help address
system level barriers to CC screening, treatment, and follow-up, our team worked with end-users (providers and
patients) to develop the Cancer Tracking System (CATSystem), a web-based, algorithm generated tool to
promote guideline adherent CC screening and retention through treatment. We piloted the CATSystem in a
Kenyan hospital and found that rates of onsite treatment for precancerous lesions and referral for treatment for
women with positive screens were higher (2.5 to 5-fold improvement) during the pilot compared to service
provision six months prior. The goal of this project is to rigorously evaluate the efficacy, implementation, and
cost-effectiveness of the CATSystem to improve rates of screening, treatment, referral, and follow-up care in a
matched, cluster randomized controlled trial in 10 Kenyan government hospitals (5 intervention, 5 standard of
care (SOC)). Specific aims (SA) of the study are to (1) Implement and evaluate the efficacy of CATSystem to
improve guideline adherent CC screening, treatment, referral and follow up, (2) Assess feasibility and
acceptability of implementation of CATSystem in government run facilities using a human centered design
approach, and (3) Calculate the costs and cost-effectiveness of the CATSystem to increase quality adjusted life
years gained. CC cancer deaths can be prevented with early detection and treatment. This study will evaluate
the public health impact of the CATSystem in improving CC screening, treatment, referral, follow-up, and the
feasibility of scale up to other low resource settings."

 People living with HIV (PLWH) have an estimated 1.6-6.0 times increased risk of developing
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) compared with individuals in the general population.
Approximately 70% of OPSCC are caused by HPV, and PLWH also have an increased prevalence of oral HPV
infection compared to the general population. While a smaller proportion of oral squamous cell carcinomas
(OSCC) are attributed to HPV, PLWH also have an increased risk of developing HPV-associated OSCC.
Disparities exist among racial/ethnic groups for OSCC/OPSCC outcomes and Black individuals with OPSCC
and OSCC have worse survival, a later stage of diagnosis, and less frequent cancer directed treatment than
other racial/ethnic groups. HPV-associated OSCC/OPSCC are potentially preventable through HPV vaccination.
Although oral cancer screening is not recommended for the general population, early detection is associated
with improved survival and screening may be important in racial/ethnic minority groups.
 Oral health care providers may be the first point of contact for OSCC/OPSCC prevention strategies.
PLWH have dental insurance provided through the Ryan White Care Act. Even so, more than half of PLWH have
unmet oral care needs and 58-64% do not receive regular dental care. PLWH also face stigma and/or
discrimination from living with HIV, including in the dental office, and may also have other intersectionality with
sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups, for which there is additional stigma. Understanding the experiences
of PLWH and the barriers/facilitators of oral health, through a lens of health equity, is needed before interventions
can be designed to engage PLWH with intersecting identities in OSCC/OPSCC prevention activities.
 As a first step, we propose to conduct a qualitative study among PLWH of diverse racial/ethnic and SGM
identities to: (1) explore individual, interpersonal, and structural oral health equity factors that serve as barriers
or facilitators of accessing oral health care, (2) to explore knowledge and perceptions of HPV vaccination and
OSCC/OPSCC, and (3) to collect recommendations on how to increase access to oral health care and engage
PLWH in OSCC/OPSCC prevention. We will conduct approximately 12-18 focus groups with 5-8 individuals
grouped by common identity group. These groupings may be by race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual
preference, or a combination of identities. The results of this study will be used to: 1) inform the design of a
multilevel, culturally appropriate intervention to increase engagement with oral health care and HPV-
associated OSCC/OPSCC prevention activities. The PI will design a randomized controlled trial to evaluate
the intervention’s impact on HPV vaccination, OSCC/OPSCC knowledge, and retention in oral health care;
and 2) assess the risks and benefits of OSCC and novel OPSCC screening among PLWH from diverse
racial/ethnic identity groups. Screening PLWH at high risk for HPV-associated OSCC/OPSCC and from of
groups with poor 5-year survival from OSCC/OPSCC may prove beneficial in reducing cancer-related mortality."

Kidney transplantation (KTx) is considered the preferred treatment for patients with end-stage kidney
disease. Despite recent changes to the kidney allocation Black and Hispanic individuals are less likely
to receive KTx, a multi-step process requiring patient referral, patient medical/surgical/psychosocial
evaluation, and patient waitlisting. As there are no standardized acceptable metrics for psychosocial
evaluations, each of steps is impacted by provider and patient bias and thwarted by social determinants
often overlooked and structural racism continues to drive of racial and ethnic disparities in KTx. We
have identified barriers and facilitators to evaluation and waitlisting for KTx, including provider bias, high
unmet social determinants of health and symptom burden in patients on hemodialysis. To address the
impact of structure racism on KTx, we now propose a multi-level intervention in full partnership with an
Executive Stakeholder Board and Workgroups comprised of patients, clinicians, caregivers, advocates,
and system leaders for dialysis organizations and transplant centers. This work will be built on 2
decades of community-engaged research and trials to improve health in diverse populations. We will
work with the Board to develop an intervention based on past work by our team and others,
supplemented by formative interview with patients, caregivers, and clinicians. To increase rates of
patients receiving KTx evaluation, patient navigators who have chronic kidney disease and waitlisted
for kidney transplant or are transplant recipients themselves will guide patients through the transplant
evaluation process. This will include conducting a social needs screen and addressing barriers
uncovered, including facilitating appointments to address unmet needs such as food insecurity and
transportation, control of symptoms and mental health challenges. To increase rates of waitlisting
among those evaluated, we will identify stigmatizing language from KTx providers; notes and provide
an anti-bias initiative including structural changes to evaluation and education for KTx nephrologists.
We will evaluate the impact of this multifactorial intervention in a clinical trial among 320 adults with an
eGFR <20ml/min/1.73m2 or on in-center hemodialysis with a primary outcome of transplant waitlisting.
Together, we will also develop a blueprint of how to conduct this work, so that it can be used nationally
to reduce inequities and inform policies, systems and practices. Our Board will serve as a durable
resource for future kidney equity work."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and its prevalence continues to
rise. AD has no clinically available curative treatments and findings from active clinical trials testing novel
disease-modifying therapeutics have thus far been disappointing. There is, therefore, a growing urgency to
identify early markers of AD, causative factors leading to dementia, and alternative treatment approaches for
halting the global crisis posed by this debilitating condition. Cardiovascular disease, as well as cerebrovascular
disease (CVD), has a strong link with both mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia; however, the question
of whether CVD modulates underlying pathophysiology of AD has only recently begun receiving attention. To
provide insights into AD relationships, non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is being utilized in
longitudinal studies of AD risk-enriched populations. The present project goes far beyond currently available MRI
techniques which lack sensitivity and specificity to address key vascular hypotheses in AD. MRI methods
commonly employed today such as fluid attenuation and susceptibility imaging only indirectly measure CVD and
cannot inform on the dynamic vascular motion and hemodynamic phenomena that have been indicated in animal
models to affect AD pathology. To address these gaps, the overarching objective of this project is to enable
characterization of cerebrovascular involvement in AD through the development and study integration
of a novel battery of non-invasive, MRI-based measures of cerebrovascular health. Building upon
foundational studies at our institution, this work proposes innovative MRI technology to improve characterization
of CVD in AD, specifically vascular stiffening and its relationship with cerebrovascular flow dynamics. We
propose an ensemble of motion encoded MRI techniques which provide detailed depiction of autoregulatory flow
dynamics and vascular stiffness in both the macro and micro vasculature. In this project, the novel methods will
be technically developed harnessing deep learning from vast prior imaging data, validated with optical imaging,
and characterized in healthy human subjects. We then will obtain key data characterizing cerebrovascular
changes in a study of AD biomarker confirmed subjects with the overall goal of identifying the modifying effect
of vascular disease on the symptom expression of cognitive impairment, AD biomarker accumulation, and
neurodegeneration. Our pilot data suggest subjects with AD have a premature increase in arterial stiffness and
decreased fluctuations in cerebral blood flow. Upon completion, this study will provide insights into which specific
aspects of CVD are primary factors moderating AD interactions. Participants targeted for this study have
extensive existing AD biomarker data and are being followed longitudinally through studies within the Wisconsin
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The methodologies will be uniquely positioned for incorporation into large
longitudinal cohort studies investigating AD mechanisms and evaluating putative risk and protective factors."
10778596,"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a mesenchymal tumor that does not progress to high-grade disease or
metastasize. Surgery was the standard treatment for desmoids, but in patients with extensive disease, surgery
can lead to complications as morbid as the tumors themselves, and ~30% of patients have local recurrence.
For these and other reasons, active observation is prescribed to an increasingly large subset of patients with
asymptomatic disease. Desmoid outcomes, however, are highly variable; under observation half of desmoids
do not progress over two years and a subset will regress spontaneously, while other desmoids grow
relentlessly. Locally aggressive tumors can cause severe symptoms: pain and contracture from desmoids in
the extremities and intestinal fistulization and death from abdominal desmoids. Once present, symptoms can
be difficult to reverse. Therefore, there is need for tools to predict outcome prior to recommending active
observation. Nearly all desmoids contain CTNNB1 mutations that constitutively activate the gene product, β-
catenin, but extensive genetic analyses have failed to identify any additional genetic alterations that may
underlie variations in patient prognosis. This proposal builds upon preliminary results suggesting that β-catenin
promotes desmoid oncogenesis through non-canonical downstream targets, including hypoxia-inducible factor
α (HIF1α). Both HIF1α protein levels and desmoid cell proliferation are also increased by activated PDGFRβ,
which may explain the fact that sorafenib, an inhibitor of PDGFRβ among other receptor tyrosine kinases, has
activity in desmoids. Based on these and other preliminary data, we hypothesize that HIF1α mediates
mitogenic signals from PDGFRβ in a manner dependent on activated β-catenin. We propose to investigate the
role of this and other pathways in desmoid biology and to use the insight gained to identify and test potential
biomarkers of desmoid tumor growth. In Aim 1, we seek to determine the roles of HIF1α and β-catenin in
mediating PDGFRβ signaling and proliferation in desmoid cells. In Aim 2, we perform highly focused screens to
identify additional genes and druggable pathways that are necessary for desmoid cell proliferation. We will
then test whether they act upstream of a PDGFRβ/β-catenin/HIF1α axis or act independently of this axis.
Finally, in Aim 3, we propose to use biopsy specimens, collected as part of a phase II trial, to examine whether
desmoid progression during active observation can be predicted by markers from the PDGFRβ/β-
catenin/HIF1α pathway or other pathways defined in Aims 1 and 2. We expect the proposed studies to identify
biomarkers that will help clinicians to identify optimal therapeutic pathways for individual desmoid patients. In
addition, by elucidating the molecular basis of oncogenesis in desmoids, this work may identify novel
therapeutic targets for the disease. Because aberrant β-catenin activity can be observed in a wide range of
neoplasms, our results may provide insight that affects our approach to other cancers as well."
10778598,"Extensive evidence has shown that post-ischemia angiogenesis contributes to the improvement of blood
flow and neurological outcomes in stroke. Cerebral ischemia rapidly triggers the induction of a variety of genes
and proteins that are involved in angiogenesis. Interventions that enhance these pro-angiogenic factors are a
promising therapeutic strategy for long-term functional recovery after ischemic stroke.
 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as a novel class of noncoding RNAs that modulate gene or
protein expression. In addition to their critical role in various biological processes, lncRNAs have also been
implicated in a variety of human neurological diseases. We and others have recently uncovered the essential
role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury in rodent stroke models, suggesting that lncRNAs are
potential therapeutic targets. However, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in
angiogenesis and late stage of neurological outcomes after ischemic stroke are poorly understood.
 Metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) is one of the first identified lncRNAs
associated with human cancers. Cumulative studies have shown that Malat1 plays pivotal roles in multiple
pathological conditions as well. Previously, we were the first to identify that (Malat1) is one of the most highly
upregulated stroke-responsive endothelial lncRNAs by using RNA-sequencing technology, and its dysfunction
contributes to acute ischemic brain injury. We also demonstrated that Malat1 can significantly suppress cell-
autonomous angiogenesis in hindlimb ischemia. Moreover, our preliminary studies showed that Malat1 levels
are significantly increased in the cerebral vasculature of the penumbral area 7d after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Of note, genetic deletion of Malat1 leads to reduced cerebral microvessel density
and increased brain atrophy in mice 28d after MCAO, whereas EC-selective transgenic overexpression of the
Malat1 gene increases post-ischemic cerebral angiogenesis in mice. Furthermore, we found that genetic
deletion of Malat1 effectively inhibits VEGF mRNA and protein expression in isolated mouse brain
microvessels 7 d after ischemic stroke. These findings have provided the basis for our Central Hypothesis
that Malat1 functions as a critical regulator in post-ischemic cerebral angiogenesis, thus affecting
long-term neurological outcomes after ischemic stroke. Three aims will be performed in this proposal. Aim
1: Examine the functional role of Malat1 in regulating post-stroke angiogenesis; Aim 2: Identify the molecular
targets of Malat1 in regulating post-stroke angiogenesis; Aim 3: Determine whether Malat1-mediated
angiogenesis affects long-term stroke outcomes. Elucidating the essential role of Malat1 in post-stroke
angiogenesis and the underlying mechanism may eventually lead us to identify novel neurorestorative targets
for the treatment of ischemic stroke."

Heart disease is the most common cause of death in industrialized nations. The presence of underlying diabetes
is the greatest risk factor for the progression of heart disease. During the current grant interval, we have
discovered previously unknown lipid metabolic pathways and signaling molecules which lead to the generation
of eicosanoid-lysophospholipids. Remarkably, the vast majority of eicosanoids in myocardium were found to be
esterified to the glycerol backbone of lysophospholipids. In addition, induction of Type I diabetes in wild-type
mice or ischemic damage in isolated wild-type mouse hearts resulted in dramatic increases in pro-inflammatory
eicosanoid-lysophospholipids. This new class of phospholipids serve as inflammatory mediators by inducing the
release of TNFa from monocytes or macrophages. Importantly, genetic ablation of iPLA2g (PNPLA8)
substantially decreased the levels of eicosanoid-lysophospholipids in myocardium in the diabetic state, during
myocardial ischemia and synergistically decreased their synthesis in diabetic myocardium rendered ischemic.
Accordingly, we propose that iPLA2g plays a central role in the pathophysiologic development of diabetic heart
disease and promotes the lethal sequelae of diabetic cardiomyopathy. In Specific Aim 1, we will utilize stable
isotope labeling of isolated perfused mouse hearts from genetically engineered cardiac myocyte-specific
conditional iPLA2g knockout mice we have generated. These studies will investigate the roles of iPLA2g in the
metabolic flux of: 1) non-esterified and esterified eicosanoids; 2) eicosanoid-lysophospholipids; and 3) other
salient oxidized phospholipids. Stable isotope pulse-chase experiments followed by penetrating bioinformatic
analyses will determine rates of metabolic flux through these newly discovered pathways. Translationally, we
will explore the impact of Type 2 diabetes on myocardial ischemic damage and the potential salvage of ischemic
myocardium in cardiac myocyte-specific iPLA2g KO mice we engineered. Endpoints of analysis include infarct
size, hemodynamic performance, and post-translational modifications of iPLA2g. In Specific Aim 2, we will utilize
cardiac myocyte-specific iPLA2b KO mice we have generated to explore the role of iPLA2b in promoting
myocardial ischemic damage and arrhythmias in WT vs. iPLA2b KO mice in the context of Type II diabetes. Next,
we will determine the ability of iPLA2b to catalyze acyltransferase or transacylase mediated re-esterification of
eicosanoid-lysophospholipids to generate oxidized phospholipids which have been implicated in damage
associated molecular patterns. In Specific Aim 3, the mechanisms through which a high fat diet induces
eicosanoid-lysolipid synthesis accompanied by inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction will be studied. The
roles of lysophospholipases in modulating eicosanoid-lysophospholipid levels and activation mechanisms for
iPLA2g will be examined. Collectively, the proposed studies will establish the significance of iPLA2g and iPLA2b
in mediating the newly identified pathways of eicosanoid-lysophospholipid synthesis and metabolism and
determine their impact on diabetic cardiomyopathy and acute ischemic damage in diabetic hearts."

Outcomes in breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) are poor. Our project focuses on the role of metabolic
abnormalities driving aggressive cancer and how inflammation and oxidative stress regulate IDC
aggressiveness via altered metabolism. Tumor cells in IDC frequently use one of two metabolic pathways:
glycolysis with glucose catabolism to lactate and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Altered
metabolism with coupling based on release and uptake of metabolites between different cells in the tumor
microenvironment is a feature of IDC. However, it is not known if metabolic coupling induces cancer
aggressiveness. Targeting tumor metabolism may also be an effective way of treating IDC and allow us to
develop new prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Multiple metabolic compartments are linked via
inflammation, glycolysis and shuttles of lactate. Fibroblasts, which are the most common non-cancer cells in
IDC tumors, have low OXPHOS, high glycolysis, high expression of lactate exporters, and high oxidative
stress. Conversely, the carcinoma cells have high expression of transporters involved in the uptake of lactate,
high OXPHOS and low glycolysis. We have identified high TP53 Induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator
(TIGAR) in IDC carcinoma cells as a driver of tumor microenvironment metabolic coupling. TIGAR reduces
glycolytic flux as a fructose-2,6 bisphosphatase enzyme. Phospho-fructo-kinase 1 (PFK1) activity, which is a
rate limiting step in glycolysis, is positively allosterically regulated by fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2).
Hence, TIGAR reduces glycolytic flux via reduced PFK1 activity. Our overall hypothesis is that tumor
microenvironment metabolic coupling, induced by TIGAR, is sufficient to induce carcinoma cell
proliferation and resistance to cell death and that tumor microenvironment metabolic uncoupling will
overcome tumor aggressiveness. We aim to use this knowledge on tumor microenvironment metabolic
coupling to discover metabolic mechanisms of IDC aggressiveness. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
metabolic coupling induced by TIGAR is sufficient to promote aggressive IDC. In Aim 2 we will test the
hypothesis that inflammatory signaling is a driver of TIGAR-induced metabolic coupling and
aggressiveness. Finally in Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a driver of TIGAR-
induced metabolic coupling and aggressiveness. In summary, understanding how metabolic interactions
between different cells in IDC tumors drive aggressiveness may provide opportunities to develop novel
therapeutics for IDC."

Adolescents account for nearly half of all new sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases annually, and of those,
non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic youth are disproportionately affected. These disparities are attributed, in part,
to differential access to and routine use of quality health care, including STI prevention and treatment. The
overarching goal of our research efforts are to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes and mitigate
disparities in STI rates by leveraging health information technology (HIT) in the emergency department (ED) to
enable detection and treatment of STIs through shared decision making. The objective of this proposal is to
scale and optimize our successful process in improving STI testing rates by leveraging HIT to: 1) seamlessly
integrate broad-scale targeted STI screening through the provision of real-time, electronic health record
embedded, clinical decision support (CDS) based on patient-reported STI-risk assessment into the normal ED
workflow to improve STI detection and 2) use mobile Health (mHealth) to improve STI treatment rates. Building
on our preliminary work, the specific aims are to: 1) use a human factors engineering approach to implement
and optimize a broad-scale computer-facilitated STI screening process into the clinical workflow of the ED; 2)
compare differences in STI detection rates between a sexual health screening (SHS)-derived electronic CDS
strategy versus usual care (no provision of CDS); and 3) compare differences in treatment adherence between
patients receiving text messages versus those receiving usual care (no text messages). Within the first aim, we
will use a human factors engineering approach to conduct workflow analyses which will inform the refinement
of implementation of an STI screening process into the clinical workflow of the ED. In the second aim, we will
conduct a pragmatic trial using an interrupted time series design to measure the impact of SHS-derived
electronic CDS on STI detection rates. In the third aim, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial, nested within
the pragmatic trial, to measure the impact of a two-way text-messaging intervention to improve treatment rates
through identifying and addressing barriers to STI treatment adherence. This innovative approach leverages
HIT to electronically integrate patient-reported sexual risk data to guide CDS and mHealth to improve
treatment adherence. We expect our contribution to help improve sexual health outcomes and reduce
disparities in the burden of STIs among at-risk, vulnerable adolescents by increasing STI detection and
treatment adherence. The proposed work is significant because it has the potential to improve the health of the
millions of adolescents who access EDs as their only source of healthcare and impact national policies related
to STI detection and treatment. In addition, this work can provide proof of concept for leveraging HIT to deliver
patient-centered care with shared decision making to address health care disparities and improve healthcare
quality and outcomes, which can be applied to other types of screening interventions in the future."

 Acute coronary syndromes and strokes together constitute a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States and Europe, approximately 80% of which are caused by atherosclerotic plaque (AP) rupture.
Over the past decade, extensive efforts have been made to identify a rupture-prone AP. Among others,
infiltration of dense neovascularization arising from vasa vasorum (VV) into the AP core plays a critical role in
AP rupture. Postmortem studies revealed key involvement of VV in AP. However, a persistent lack of a
noninvasive, high-resolution imaging tool to longitudinally assess abnormal microvascular expansion remains a
critical barrier to adequate in-vivo investigation on how VV affects AP progression and contributes to eventual
rupture. To address this dire unmet need, we propose an innovative transcutaneous super resolution
ultrasound (SRU) imaging. The technology development in this project seeks to shift the current US imaging
approach in identifying microvessels of AP from “intravascular” to a “fully noninvasive transcutaneous” imaging
approach. This is only possible by achieving unprecedented high spatial resolution at large depth, breaking
acoustic diffraction limit of the ultrasound frequency that governs spatial resolution. Our group has performed
in-depth feasibility studies where SRU imaging successfully identified neomicrovessels in cholesterol-fed rabbit
AP, evaluated against µCT and histology. Additionally, areas requiring further technical optimization were
identified. Such technology developments and preliminary data thus far rigorously support our overarching
hypothesis that enhanced and optimized SRU will accurately stage plaque progression and identify rupture-
prone plaques by directly measuring VV changes with exquisite detail. To test the hypothesis, we will use a
well-established, clinically relevant cholesterol-fed rabbit AP rupture model, which has shown the most
similarity to human plaque pathology including VV neovascularization, to validate the novel SRU system to 1)
Successfully quantify changes in vessel density and 2) Identify rupture-prone AP. To achieve these goals, we
propose the following specific aims: 1) To develop enhanced SRU at high frequency using a commercial small
animal imaging probe 2) To determine if VV changes estimated by SRU correlate with AP progression and are
predictive of AP rupture. The immediate outcomes of the proposed work are an affordable noninvasive small
animal SRU imaging tool and it’s validation on a clinically relevant rabbit AP model, which also can be used for
other important small animal disease models, which are associated with microvessel abnormality such as
cancer angiogenesis and kidney diseases to name a few. With proper adaptations into a clinical mid frequency
probe and validation in clinical settings in future, this work will lead to our long-term translational goal to
integrate SRU in a facile manner into the current clinical standard of carotid duplex sonography that has shown
poor specificity to plaque vulnerability. This will help to effectively stratify patients at high risk of strokes and
guide adequate intervention/treatment options for stroke prevention, exerting highly influential clinical impact."

Decades of both epidemiological research and in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies have consistently
reported an association between environmental nickel exposure and lung cancer. As early as 1990, the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified nickel compounds as Group 1 carcinogens:
substances confirmed as carcinogenic to humans. Although the multiple mechanisms, including oxidative
stress, epigenetic effects, and activation of signaling pathways that trigger differential gene regulation has
been thought to be associated with nickel carcinogenic effect, there is no evidence that a single nickel-
inducible factor can drive transformation of human bronchial cells, to the best of our knowledge. In our
Preliminary Studies, we performed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) deep sequencing using the Illumina
HiSeqTM2000/2500 high throughout system to evaluate whether nickel affects the abundance of 5,929
known lncRNAs. Nickel treatment altered the levels of 24 of these lncRNAs in normal primary human
bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), while 16 of them were verified in Real-time PCR assay. With
overexpression and/or knockdown analyses of the 16 lncRNAs, we further discovered that a reduced
abundance of maternally-expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was sufficient for malignant transformation of HBECs.
Our demonstration that MEG3 inhibition can independently transform HBECs provides the basis of our
central hypothesis that MEG3 downregulation drives transformation and tumorigenecity of HBECs after
nickel exposure. Here we propose to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie our novel findings
that MEG3 downregulation is a crucial driver for nickel-induced malignant transformation of HBECs with the
following Specific Aims: 1, To test the hypothesis that p62 and C-Myc define an important MEG3-regulated
axis that promotes transformation of HBECs upon MEG3 deficiency; 2, To test the hypothesis that the
crosstalk between a p62/C-Myc cascade and the PHLPP/HIF-1α axis causes the MEG3-deficiency-
correlated malignant transformation of HBECs; 3, To explore the biological significance of MEG3 deletion
and its activated downstream molecules in lung tumoriginecity. Our novel Preliminary Findings suggest that
MEG3 is downregulated by nickel exposure both in vitro and in vivo, that knockdown of MEG3 alone can
transform HBECs, and that crosstalk between the putative signaling transducers downstream of MEG3
mediate the malignant transformation of HBECs caused by MEG3 deficiency. This proposal's strengths are
the complementary use of cell culture models and novel conditional MEG3 knockout mouse models to
examine integration of the molecular events that account for nickel-mediated lung carcinogenesis.
Clarifying these issues will provide valuable insights regarding MEG3 as a prognostic biomarker and/or as
a therapeutic target. Ultimately, both uses could improve clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients."

 The ability to genetically modify the mouse genome has revolutionized biomedical research. However,
its impact on our understanding of brain disorders is limited partially due to the inherent differences in the
structure and physiology of the brain between rodents and humans. Most notably, the prefrontal cortex is one
of the largest and most developed portions of the human brain and a top candidate for pathological processes
in many psychiatric disorders. Yet, rodents have only a rudimentary prefrontal cortex and are thus limited in
exhibiting the complex cognitive functions that are mediated by this region. The lack of predictive animal
models is now considered one of the key bottlenecks in developing effective treatments for brain disorders.
 Non-human primates are much more closely related to humans than are rodents, and this is reflected in
their brain development, structure and physiology. Hence, it is increasingly recognized that they provide an
attractive model to study higher brain function and brain disorders. The recent development of highly efficient
CRISPR genome-editing technology made it feasible to directly manipulate the genome in zygotes, thus
expanding genetic manipulations to many species including non-human primates.
 In the past 4 years, we have been collaborating with a team of scientists in the Brain Cognition and
Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences to
use CRISPR/Cas9 to generate macaque monkey models of monogenic ASD. We have now successfully
generated Shank3 mutant cynomolgus macaques. Shank3 is a glutamatergic postsynaptic scaffolding protein
critical for synapse development and function. Heterozygous mutations of the Shank3 gene in humans lead to
Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), an autism spectrum disorder. Initial characterization of the 5 founder
Shank3 mutant monkeys revealed sleep disturbances, motor deficits, and increased repetitive behaviors, as
well as social and learning impairments. Unbiased analysis of fMRI data showed altered local and global
connectivity patterns indicative of circuit abnormalities. Together, these results parallel some aspects of the
gene-circuit-behavior dysfunction in human ASD and PMS. Here we propose, in collaboration with our
colleagues in SIAT, China, to generate F1 generation of Shank3 mutant monkeys to validate initial
observations, to further behavioral and neurophysiological characterization and to bring mutant sperms to US
for establishing a colony for sharing with autism research community."

 Knee injuries, e.g., meniscus tears, increase the risk of developing post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA)
by at least 10 fold. PTOA leads to disability with a substantial healthcare cost of $3 billion per year in the US.
Although rehabilitation is required after injury, current protocols only address the return to pre-injury activities.
Critical knowledge gaps exist regarding how to optimize early rehabilitation efforts to preserve long-term
knee cartilage health. Using a well-established rat PTOA model, we propose to characterize responses of knee
cartilage to the manipulation of three elements commonly implemented during post-injury rehabilitation: 1)
durations of initial non-weight bearing, 2) modifications of physical activity level, and 3) deviations in lower-limb
joint kinematics. The use of a pre-clinical rat model provides the experimental control over disease timeline to
facilitate a mechanistic study to understand PTOA. Our overall hypothesis is that post-injury interventions
that emphasize maintaining pre-injury knee loading profile (e.g. minimizing weight-bearing restriction,
regaining physical activity level, or reducing deviations in joint kinematics) will delay PTOA. We will
systematically test this hypothesis using innovative experimental approaches and technologies to address the
knowledge gaps in the PTOA rehabilitation literature as described in the following Aims. (Aim 1) Non-weight
bearing durations in rats after the medial meniscal transection (MMT) surgery performed on the left hind limb
will be varied using hind-limb suspension. The comparisons of cartilage health among varying exposures of
suspension determines the causal effect of initial non-weight bearing on PTOA progression. The use of hind-
limb suspension instead of limb immobilization reduces harmful consequences of joint contracture and is more
in line with current practice of prescribing initial non-weight bearing after knee injuries. (Aim 2) Post-injury
physical activity levels will be modified by varying the amount of daily treadmill running. Rats’ pre-injury
activity levels will first be established to allow standardized quantification of post-injury activity modification (%
of pre-MMT). The causal effect of post-injury activity level on PTOA progression can then be determined. (Aim
3) 3D hind-limb joint kinematics will be assessed using biplanar X-ray motion analysis at multiple time points
before and after MMT to determine whether early post-injury joint kinematic deviations are predictive of the
ultimate severity of PTOA. Using X-ray videos to directly quantify 3D bone movements can overcome the
significant errors associated with the use of skin markers. For all three Aims, we will incorporate our contrast
enhanced microCT analysis with conventional histopathology to provide complementary evaluations of the 3D
microstructure/compositions of knee cartilage. Findings from this innovative work will provide insight into the
potential causal effects of post-injury rehabilitative modifications in limb weight bearing and joint kinematics on
PTOA progression. Such new knowledge is fundamental to advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis
of PTOA and developing translational research to reduce PTOA by optimizing post-injury rehabilitation."

The bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important cause of hospital-acquired and antibiotic-resistant infections,
including pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection. Infection risk sharply increases when K.
pneumoniae is present in the gut, and K. pneumoniae must overcome many barriers to successfully colonize the
gut, including the gut microbiome. While disruption of the gut microbiome through antibiotics can permit
colonization, K. pneumoniae frequently colonizes the gut in the absence of antibiotics when an intact microbiome
is present. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how K. pneumoniae invades the intact gut
microbiome. Furthermore, the specific mechanisms underlying the ability of K. pneumoniae to compete with the
endogenous gut microbiota remain unexplored. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize
factors necessary for K. pneumoniae gut colonization in an intact gut microbiome and determine how these
factors influence K. pneumoniae fitness in the gut. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Kp employs
microbiome dependent and specific factors to enhance their ability to directly compete with the host microbiota
or survive microbiota-mediated modulation of host inflammation to invade the intact gut microbiome, which is
critical for Kp gut colonization. I will test this hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) define the role of a previously
identified gut fitness factor, the tellurium resistance (ter) operon during invasion of an intact gut microbiome; 2)
determine the role of the ter operon in response to physiologically relevant stresses and; 3) systematically identify
K. pneumoniae fitness factors during invasion of intact gut microbiomes. The work in this proposal is innovative,
as it requires the development of novel transposon sequencing application, and it addresses a gap in
understanding that can shift the current paradigm of K. pneumoniae gut colonization. Completion of this work
will have sustained positive impact through the identification, characterization, and prioritization of K.
pneumoniae factors necessary for invasion of the intact gut microbiome, which will help guide the development
of therapeutics targeted at the disruption of K. pneumoniae gut colonization. Finally, the research in this proposal
is complemented by a comprehensive training plan designed to develop a foundational skillset for the pursuit of
research focused on mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis directly informed by and applicable to the clinic. This
project will be undertaken within the University of Michigan in conjunction with a distinguished team of co-
mentors. This team of co-mentors will complement that candidate's expertise in host-pathogen interaction by
providing training in microbial ecology, exploration of bacterial physiology, and comprehensive analyses of host-
microbial systems necessary for the candidate's transition to independence. These state-of-the-art studies will
lead to the identification and characterization of K. pneumoniae factors that permit the invasion of the intact gut
microbiome and the corresponding role of the microbiota in this process to enable the design of therapies to
reduce the impact of K. pneumoniae disease."

 Exposure to violence and trauma in Latin America significantly contributes to migration to the U.S.,
bringing attention to the mental health consequences of forced migration at the U.S./Mexico border. Traumatic
events occur at every stage of migration and negatively impact mental health. Evidence suggests that Latinx
immigrants in the U.S. enjoy an initial health advantage that erodes over time spent in the country as
immigrants experience discrimination and are less likely to seek health and mental health care. Also, this
health advantage comes into question when analyzed by sub-groups. Insufficient evidence exists of the
intersection of trauma exposure; individual characteristics; and mental health outcomes of depression, anxiety,
and PTSD among recent Latinx immigrant adults. This K01 Award proposes a mixed methods design that
incorporates latent class analysis methods to develop mental health phenotypes of recent Latinx immigrants
based on the intersections of trauma, individual characteristics and mental health. This research will develop
ethical approaches to studying trauma and mental health cross-sectionally and set the foundation for future
prospective research of mental health phenotype evolution to inform intervention development and delivery.
 This research has three specific aims: (1) Develop initial mental health phenotypes in a sample of
recent Latinx immigrant adults using latent class analysis methods and examine their demographic and trauma
exposure correlates (trauma exposure, sex, age, gender, marital status, education, country of origin and
ethnicity); (2) Provide an in-depth understanding of participant experiences of trauma exposure and mental
health to illuminate findings in SA1 using qualitative methods; and (3) Validate the phenotypes and any
additional constructs that emerge from qualitative data with a second survey sample of 313 recent Latinx
immigrant adults at the U.S./Mexico border.
 My career development plan includes three Training Goals: (1) Develop comprehensive expertise in
structural equation modeling and latent class analysis methods as well as growth curve modeling and latent
transition analysis; (2) Gain extensive expertise in qualitative and mixed methods research at the intersection
trauma exposure, individual characteristics, and mental health of Latinx immigrants with an emphasis on space

understanding gender differences in trauma exposure, as well as recruitment and prospective retention of
vulnerable populations; and (4) Develop broad expertise in dissemination and translation of research with
immigrant populations for policy and practitioner audiences. This K01 Award will support my long-term career
goal of becoming an independent investigator conducting ethical longitudinal and intervention research on the
mental health of recent Latinx immigrants in the U.S. The research plan will produce data for a multi-site R01

Disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function is an important cause of HIV-associated chronic immune
activation but underlying molecular mechanisms are not known. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
HIV infection impairs the regenerative capacity of intestinal stem cells, resulting in long-lasting barrier
dysfunction. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of available data in the literature showing that in
inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal stem cell pool and the compositional balance of intestinal cell types
is disrupted, and our own published results showing intestinal stem cell proliferation is impaired in a subgroup of
HIV+ patients with high systemic inflammation and poor clinical outcome. Intestinal stem cell function can be
tested in vitro by expanding them into self-organizing three-dimensional structures termed “organoids”. They can
be further differentiated into all intestinal epithelial cell types. This proposal leverages access to intestinal stem
cells through intestinal biopsies by Dr. Ma Somsouk, an expert in HIV-associated gut inflammation, and expertise
in organoid growth and basic HIV virology present in Dr. Melanie Ott's laboratory to examine intestinal stem cell
function and organoid growth in HIV infection. The central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) To
define how HIV infection influences intestinal stem cell function in T cell: organoid co-culture experiments. The
working hypothesis is that early contact between intestinal stem cells and HIV-infected T cells leads to stem cell
damage, impaired gut epithelial regeneration and long-lasting barrier dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested
in T cell: organoid co-culture models established in the Ott lab. We will determine the effect of HIV-infected T
cells on organoid growth, differentiation, barrier function and transcription at the single-cell level. Candidate
factors such as TNF-α or factors emerging from our studies will be added directly to organoid culture media to
analyze effects on growth and differentiation. 2) To determine the effects of chronic HIV infection on intestinal
stem cell function. Our working hypothesis is that intestinal stem cell function is altered in HIV+ individuals,
especially those with late onset of treatment and poor immunological recovery. This hypothesis will be tested by
comparing growth and differentiation of organoids grown from HIV-infected individuals with different onset of
treatment or uninfected individuals using morphological, functional and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.
This proposal will provide detailed insight into fundamental processes within the gastrointestinal tract that impact
infection, persistence, and comorbidities in people living with HIV and is as such well aligned with this RFA. It is
innovative because it shifts the focus to intestinal stem cells and their ability to renew the gut epithelium for
proper barrier functions. It also uses innovative new organoid technology combined with clinical studies aimed
at explaining why barrier defects persist in patients despite ART. Thus, important advances in the basic biology
and novel therapeutic approaches towards HIV- associated chronic immune activation are expected."

Calcium activated Chloride Channels (CaCCs) and other TMEM16 family members form ion channels and/or
lipid scramblases that help orchestrate a large number of cellular processes. Humans express 10 different
paralogs labeled TMEM16A-K (skipping I) that are expressed throughout the body, and they aid in diverse
phenomena including coagulation of the blood, suppression of inflammatory signals in the joints, control of pain
through nociceptive neurons, and modulating neuronal excitability in multiple brain regions – just to name a
few. How this family can be involved in so many different physiological processes remains an intriguing open
question. The founding member (TMEM16A) was cloned by 3 labs (including the Jan lab) in 2008 making it
possible to elucidate the biological roles listed above, but also ushering in the ability to dissect the biophysical
properties of these proteins. In the following years, the Jan lab employed mutagenesis screens,
electrophysiology, and small molecule screening to uncover the ion conduction, lipid scrambling, and gating
properties of TMEM16A and F in addition to solving high resolution cryo-EM structures (in collaboration with
the Cheng lab) of TMEM16A (a Cl- channel) and structures of TMEM16F (a dual scramblase/ion channel).
Meanwhile, the Grabe lab was the first to show in atomic detail how nhTMEM16 (a fungal scramblase) flips
lipids by inducing large-scale deformations in the membrane that thin the bilayer near a hydrophilic grove that
aids polar headgroups passing from one leaflet to the other. Despite these advances, fundamental questions
about the function of these proteins remain that we intend to answer here. First, phosphatidylserine (PS)
exposure to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via TMEM16F is the key signaling event that initiates
platelet-dependent coagulation and microvesicle (MV) production; however, no one has demonstrated how a
TMEM16 flips a negatively charged PS molecule at the atomic level under physiological conditions, the lipid
specificity of TMEM16s is poorly understood, and it has been suggested that scramblases may also
accomplish lipid flipping via an “out of the groove” mode in addition to the one revealed by the Grabe lab.
Second, we hypothesize that Cl- conduction occurs via a dedicated pore shielded from the membrane in Cl-
selective CaCC, but despite the existence of many TMEM16A structures, this has not been shown. We also
hypothesize that scramblases exhibit selectivity that is lipid-dependent because ions co-permeate with lipids at
the protein-membrane interface. Together, our studies will reveal basic mechanisms related to how TMEM16
family members carry out a diverse set of biological phenomena."

Negative mood is a common feature of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, which inflict
immeasurable human suffering along with a combined economic burden of $600 billion in the US each year. The
brain basis of negative affect has been the focus of costly research efforts, but two critical barriers have slowed
scientific discovery. First, there is no mechanistic explanation for how negative affect is caused in the brain. A
solution to this barrier can be found in predictive processing, an emerging paradigm for unifying brain
mechanisms across emotion, cognition, perception, movement, and other psychological domains. Predictive
processing accounts posit that the brain continuously constructs prediction signals to control visceromotor and
motor movements, while copies of these prediction signals anticipate incoming sensory signals from the body
and the external world. Incoming sensory signals are thought to be relayed throughout the brain as prediction
error signals. No study to date has examined negative affect in relation to the dynamics of signal flow within the
specific architectural features of the brain. To surmount this barrier, I will take advantage of a conceptual
innovation from our lab and thirty years of tract-tracing studies in mammals to test the hypothesis that prediction
signals and prediction error signals can be traced across specific layers of cerebral cortex and subcortical
structures. Briefly, prediction signals are thought to originate in deep layers of cortices that have less laminar
development (e.g., anterior midcingulate cortex, aMCC, which is important for visceromotor control and affect)
and arrive to subcortical structures (e.g., hypothalamus, involved in visceromotor control) and primary sensory
cortices (e.g., primary visual cortex, V1). Interoceptive prediction error signals should originate from subcortical
structures (e.g., hypothalamus) and other (exteroceptive) sensory prediction errors should originate in primary
sensory cortices (e.g., V1), arriving to the upper and deep layers, respectively, of cortices with less laminar
development (e.g., aMCC). In human subjects, these hypotheses remain to be tested due to a second barrier:
neuroimaging methods have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to measure activity in deep vs. upper cortical
layers and small subcortical structures. Newly developed ultra-high field (7 Tesla) fMRI techniques have
sufficient resolution to overcome this barrier. With this methodological innovation, I will probe the mechanisms
that cause negative affect in the circuitry outlined above via functional connectivity analyses of a 7T fMRI dataset
our lab has curated. Ninety-two healthy subjects were instructed to anticipate visual or somatosensory stimuli
(prediction period) that were either unpleasant or neutral and then were presented with the stimuli (prediction
error period). In two specific aims, I will 1) measure dynamic prediction signals during negative affect, and 2)
characterize prediction error signals during negative affect. The proposed research promises to deliver a new
paradigm for studying the brain basis of negative affect, with the ultimate goal of developing targeted treatments
for negative mood, a hallmark feature of many mental illnesses."

humans share the identical amino acid sequence of Otp. To study the functional impact of OtpQ153R/+, we have
generated new knock-in mice that carry the same human mutation. Similar to the human subjects, we found that
mice heterozygous for OtpQ153R (OtpQ153R/+) survive through adulthood but develop obesity and glucose
intolerance. These findings, therefore, strongly support a causal role for OtpQ153R/+ in human obesity.
We propose to investigate the mechanisms behind OtpQ153R-induced obesity and glucose deficits. Otp is broadly
distributed in the central nervous system. To determine the brain site where Otp deficiency impairs energy and
glucose balance, we generated and characterized a floxed Otp allele (Otpflox). Our new preliminary studies show
that selective loss of Otp in forebrain Sim1-Cre-expressing neurons reproduces lethality seen in Otp null mice,
whereas its haploinsufficiency in these neurons results in obesity. Furthermore, we find that Otp is transiently
expressed in a subset of immature POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) and is
required for the POMC→NPY/AgRP fate switch during development. Selective deletion of Otp in these neurons
leads to a significant loss of POMC-derived NPY/AgRP neuron identity. Collectively, our new findings suggest
that Otp plays critical roles in two distinct populations of hypothalamic neurons to regulate energy and glucose
metabolism.
In summary, the overarching goals of these studies are to better understand OtpQ153R-induced pathophysiology
and develop mechanism-based therapeutics to mitigate metabolic syndrome in human OtpQ153R/+ patients."

Itch is a complex physiological process that incorporates detection of irritants by sensory neurons in the skin
which activate spinal interneurons and ultimately, cortical projection neurons to generate a response. G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an integral role at each level of itch sensation and transmission.
Although conventionally considered cell surface receptors that are desensitized and internalized following
ligand binding, new evidence has established the ability of GPCRs to signal from endosomes. However, little
is known about the mechanisms that regulate endosomal signaling of GPCRs and nothing is known about
the role of endosomal GPCRs signaling in itch or whether endosomal GPCRs are a viable therapeutic target
for itch. This proposal hypothesizes that: 1. Gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and neurokinin 1
receptor (NK1R), two key receptors in itch transmission in the spinal cord, can recruit and assemble multi-
protein complexes from the endosomal compartment that facilitate endosomal signaling and mediate
prolonged hyperexcitability of spinal interneurons. That the ability of GRPR and NK1R to signaling from
endosomes leads to itch transmission in the spinal cord and endocytic inhibitors that block GRPR and NK1R
endosomal signaling can inhibit scratching behavior in mice. 2. Targeting endosomal signaling of GRPR and
NK1R using nanoparticles is a more effective strategy in inhibiting itch than targeting cell surface receptors.
Endosomal signaling of GRPR and NK1R will be characterized in model cell lines, spinal interneurons that
mediate itch transmission, and in intact animals. Pharmaceutical and genetic approaches will be used to
inhibit endosomal trafficking of GRPR and NK1R. Aim 1 will characterize the importance of endosomal
trafficking and signaling of GRPR and NK1R in spinal interneurons for the transmission of itch. The role of
endosomal signaling in itch will be addressed by electrophysiology, and by itch behavioral assays in intact
animals. Aim 2 will characterize the ability of GRPR to traffic to endosomes and assemble the multi-protein
complexes that result in subcellular specific signaling events. These signaling complexes will be studied using
advanced biophysical and imaging approaches with high spatiotemporal resolution. Aim 3 will use advanced
chemical biology, nanoengineering and nanoparticle encapsulation to deliver GRPR and NK1R antagonists
to endosomes, probing the importance of endosomal signaling of GRPR and NK1R in itch transmission and
to determine whether endosomal GPCRs are a viable therapeutic target."
10755700,"Axons continuously respond to external signals in their environment as they grow and
navigate toward their target tissues during development, and for maintenance and repair
in adult life. mRNA localization and local protein synthesis is a conserved mechanism that
allows for rapid and axon-autonomous responses to external trophic and guidance cues.
Despite growing appreciation for the functions of axonal protein synthesis, a major gap in
our knowledge is in understanding how the nascent proteins are further processed and
localized in axons to generate fully functional proteins. Our preliminary results suggest
that a neurotrophic factor (Nerve Growth Factor) acutely regulates local protein synthesis
and lipidation (prenylation) of newly-made proteins in axons. It has been assumed that
protein prenylation is a constitutive mechanism that occurs throughout the cytoplasm and
is permissive for cellular functions. In striking contrast, we find that, in neurons, prenylation
is under exquisite spatio-temporal control by extrinsic signals. The goal of this application
is to define whether coupled axonal protein synthesis and prenylation serves as a
regulatory mechanism to localize and enrich proteins in axonal compartments to ensure
dynamic and spatial responses to extrinsic growth-promoting cues. We will use a
combination of imaging, biochemical, and functional analyses in compartmentalized
neuronal cultures, as well as in vivo analyses in mice to accomplish this goal. These
studies will advance the knowledge of spatial modes of signaling in neurons that underlie
axon development, maintenance, and regeneration."

The field of quantitative biology involves using mathematics, statistics, and modeling to analyze the results of
biological experiments. Students at the high school and undergraduate levels can develop these skills through
a comprehensive STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. These analytical skills are
crucial for success in many careers, including those in science, and for making informed decisions in daily life.
However, despite the importance of this training, and the significant funding provided by the U.S. Department
of Education, biological science teachers often struggle to incorporate quantitative analysis into their curricula.
This is often due to a lack of resources, equipment, expertise, and time. This proposal aims to address these
challenges by creating equipment, experiments, and comprehensive resources that can be used to bring
quantitative analysis into teaching laboratories.
One barrier to incorporating quantitative analysis in teaching laboratories is that the necessary equipment is
designed for research use; it is too expensive, bulky, fragile, and complicated for use in an educational
environment. To address this problem, we will continue to develop the EdvoReader, a simple, integrated device
designed for students to perform inquiry-based quantitative biology experiments in the lab. In Phase I, we
developed a thermal cycler with a precision optical detection system that is capable of both colorimetry and
real-time PCR analysis. In Phase II, we will refine the EdvoReader’s optical system and focus on the
development of a touch screen interface that creates a faster and easier workflow and directs users through
setup, operation, and data analysis. By building this instrument from the ground up, the EdvoReader can
incorporate the features most important to educators while minimizing costs.
To complement the EdvoReader, we will develop a series of inquiry-based experiments for the educational
laboratory. One set of experiments focuses on the basics of environmental monitoring, focusing on water
quality testing. A second set of experiments integrates quantitative biology into experiments commonly
performed in biology, biochemistry, environmental science, and biotechnology classes. To complement the
hands-on experiments, we will create an extensive training library, including how-to videos, interactive
simulations, and materials for STEM career exploration. An assessment team has been recruited to evaluate
the EdvoReader and associated experiments for its effects on STEM identity and for the development of
quantitative skills in high school students. By combining a low cost, user-friendly instrument with dedicated
experiments, the EdvoReader platform will provide educators with an inexpensive and accessible pathway to
teach quantitative biotechnology. In turn, students will gain valuable hands-on training and an understanding of
STEM analysis that will be critical for career development."
10758202,"Project Summary: The striatum is implicated in learning, reward and addiction, including alcoholism. Within
the striatum, ablation of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) results in behavioral and cognitive deficits similar to
those observed in alcoholics. Interestingly, there is evidence indicating a decrease in CINs following chronic
ethanol exposure. In agreement, I have found that striatal cholinergic function is impaired in monkeys following
long-term ethanol consumption. Therefore, the overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that chronic
ethanol exposure decreases striatal CIN numbers or function and that these ethanol-induced cholinergic
impairments underlie the behavioral and cognitive deficits associated with alcoholism. To test this
hypothesis, I propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1 – I will determine the effect of acute ethanol on striatal
CIN subtypes using transgenic mice, immunohistochemical, RNAscope, and electrophysiological techniques.
The characterization of CIN subtype sensitivity to ethanol will be of broad interest to alcohol and basal ganglia
researchers alike. Specific Aim 2 – I will determine if chronic ethanol-induced deficits in striatal CINs are due
to a loss of CINs, an impairment of CIN function, or both. There is agreement in the literature that the striatal
cholinergic circuit is hypo-functional following chronic ethanol exposure but the source of this dysfunction is not
clear. Therefore, I will determine if CINs are lost and/or if CIN function is compromised (with electrophysiology)
following chronic ethanol exposure. These results will be the first to examine the effects of chronic ethanol on
striatal CIN function. Specific Aim 3 – I will then determine if in vivo chemogenetic manipulation of CIN activity
after chronic ethanol are sufficient to ameliorate the behavioral and cognitive deficits that accompany chronic
ethanol exposure including ethanol consumption and performance on an operant reversal learning task.
Throughout my career, I have been interested in the mechanisms underlying normal and aberrant behaviors. I
have been fortunate to have mentors that taught me the skills required to engage in meaningful research. At
every stage of my career, I have advanced in my technical ability and scientific sophistication and as I continue
to train, my mentors, Kim Blackwell and David Lovinger, will challenge me to constantly improve as a scientist
and to ask impactful questions, to design compelling experiments to address those questions, and to present my
findings clearly and effectively in manuscripts and presentations. Furthermore, we have a plan to ensure that I
receive training to conduct exciting experiments, run a successful lab, and mentor trainees. In addition, Drs.
Adron Harris and Marisa Roberto, two successful researchers, have agreed to serve on my advisory committee
to ensure that I am successful in my transition to an independent investigator. Thus, I am confident that with the
mentorship of my mentors, my extramural advisory committee, my technical consultants, and the institutional
support of NIAAA and George Mason University, I will be able to execute the proposed experiments, attain a
faculty position, and thrive as a successful independent neuroscientist."
10758203,"Project Summary
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are exceptionally sensitive to conventional genotoxic chemotherapy. This
is likely due to the distinct DNA damage response (DDR) features of TGCTs and the germ cells from which they
arise. Unlike somatic cells which often respond to DNA damage by arresting the cell cycle and conducting DNA
repair, germ cells as well as long-lived pluripotent stem cells typically avoid the use of error-prone repair
mechanisms and favor apoptosis, reducing the risk of genetic alterations in subsequent generations. Similarly,
the TGCT precursor lesion, germ cell neoplasia in situ, does not show activation of a DDR, whereas precursor
lesions of most somatic cancers express markers of an activated DDR in response to oncogene activation which
serves as a barrier to tumor progression. To study TGCTs, our lab has developed the first genetically engineered
mouse model of malignant TGCTs by conditional activation of Kras, an oncogene, and inactivation of Pten, a
tumor suppressor gene, in germ cells. The malignant teratocarcinomas generated in these mice are composed
of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) and differentiated teratoma tissue. Interestingly, EC cells, both in vivo
and cultured in vitro, express stem cell markers, have tumor propagating activity, and are readily killed following
chemotherapy treatment. Using cells derived from this model, the experiments proposed here will elucidate the
DDR properties of TGCTs and the cells from which they arise, which will inform the mechanisms underlying their
exceptional chemosensitivity. Specifically, this proposal aims to: understand how the cells that give rise to
TGCTs respond to oncogenic events, apparently avoiding DDR activation (Aim 1), and determine the mechanism
underlying the chemosensitivity of the embryonal carcinoma components of TGCTs and the chemoresistance of
their differentiated counterparts (Aim 2). Aim 1 will be investigated by generating primordial germ cell-like cells
(PGCLCs) and embryonic germ cell-like cells (EGCLCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived
from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with conditional Pten and Kras alleles and assessing malignant
transformation, the degree of DNA replication stress, the extent of DNA damage, and the nature of the DDR in
untransformed and transformed cells. For Aim 2, I will analyze differential gene expression in EC and
differentiated cells before and after treatment with genotoxic chemotherapy and investigate the role of
differentially regulated pathways in the chemosensitivity phenotype. It is critically important to study this curable
cancer because understanding the basis of TGCT chemosensitivity will apply broadly to the development of
treatments for the many other cancers that do not respond favorably to conventional chemotherapy. Additionally,
understanding the malignant transformation of pluripotent cell types, including embryonic germ cells and iPSCs,
will be important for the improvement of stem-cell based therapies, which carry the risk of tumorgenicity."
10757347,"ABSTRACT
 Many brain areas, such as neocortex and olfactory bulb, are vertically organized into
layers containing distinct cell types that show different activity profiles and project to
different downstream targets. Fast, volumetric imaging is thus indispensable to capture
the dynamics of such neuronal populations within their stratified environments. While
multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has become the gold standard for high resolution
imaging from deep within brain tissue, it is generally restricted to 2D planar imaging. We
propose to develop a technique to perform volumetric MPM where a long-range z-stack
is acquired by near-instantaneous axial scanning, while maintaining 3D micron-scale
resolution. Our technique, called reverberation MPM, enables the monitoring of
neuronal populations over large scales, including the depth scale, with no speed penalty
compared to conventional MPM.
 Reverberation MPM is a new technique which we have demonstrated only recently
with proof of principle two-photon experiments. Much of our proposal will be focused on
further developing this tool and characterizing its performance. Moreover, we propose to
extend our technique to three-photon microscopy, for increased depth penetration. Our
goal is to perform comprehensive 3D-resolved imaging of neuronal populations within
volumes up to 1×1×1mm3, spanning the entire thickness of the mouse cortex.
 A key advantage of reverberation MPM is its extreme simplicity. It requires only the
addition of a reverberation loop to a conventional MPM equipped with fast detection
electronics. Moreover, it allows the acquisition of an arbitrary number of planes without
increasing setup complexity. Other advantages are that our system is light efficient and
easily compatible with video-rate scanning, making it ideal for volumetric calcium
imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators. These advantages make
reverberation MPM particularly attractive as a general tool for fast, high resolution,
large-scale volumetric imaging in brain tissue."
10757349,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) the predominant histologic subtype of lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma the major subset
of NSCLC. Despite clinical progress with the use of targeted therapies, drug resistance remains a problem that
limits patient survival. A less well understood aspect of the evolution of drug resistance is the drug tolerant,
“persister” cell state, in which a subpopulation of cancer cells survives initial targeted treatment to form a minimal
residual disease (MRD) reservoir that is a precursor to acquired resistance. We propose an innovative,
multidisciplinary and collaborative project to hopefully improve the survival of NSCLC patients by defining the
role that the Hippo-YAP pathway plays in promoting drug tolerance and MRD to current pathway targeted
therapies. Extending work that we completed in the first funding cycle of this R01, we aim to capitalize on our
discovery of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway as a critical molecular circuit and therapeutic target in the many
cancers driven by hyperactivation of RTK-RAS-MAPK signaling. Our data suggest an emerging paradigm in
which YAP activation is a key functional feature of the drug tolerant state during RTK-RAS-MAPK targeted
inhibition in NSCLC. We observed YAP activation during therapy in multiple oncogene-driven NSCLC preclinical
models treated with EGFR, ALK, KRAS and SHP2 inhibitors. YAP upregulation promoted the expression of
several survival factors including BCL-xL and RTKs such as FGFR1 and ErbB2. Furthermore, through single-
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) performed longitudinally in clinical specimens obtained from patients treated
with targeted inhibitors, we discovered that residual cancer cells often show lineage plasticity and a transition to
an alveolar type (AT)1/2-like transcriptional state that is a novel phenotype of slow cycling, drug tolerant cancer
cells. We verified this occurred in bona fide cancer cells (i.e., not from misannotated normal alveolar cells) and
was distinct from therapy-naïve adenocarcinoma or normal AT1/2 cells. Our data suggest a role for YAP in
promoting drug tolerance and this novel form of lineage plasticity. Inhibition of YAP signaling with YAP/TEAD
small molecule inhibitors that are in clinical development suppressed drug tolerant cancer cell survival and
expression of molecular markers of the AT1/2-like lineage switch. We propose to further test the hypothesis that
YAP signaling is a key molecular switch that regulates the biological and clinical response to RTK-MAPK pathway
inhibitors. In Aim 1, we define the role of YAP in promoting drug tolerance and the AT1/2-like lineage plasticity
present in drug tolerant cancer cells in RTK-RAS-MAPK-driven NSCLCs. We also test whether pharmacologic
inhibition of YAP/TEAD can thwart MRD and enhance response to RTK-RAS inhibitors in preclinical models. In
Aim 2, we study molecular features of YAP/TEAD activation and the AT1/2-like lineage switch as biomarkers of
MRD and clinical outcomes using tumors from patients before and on treatment. This project offers insight into
the role of YAP and lineage plasticity in therapy tolerance and MRD, with potential for future clinical translation."

Prostate cancer is the second deadliest cancer for American men. MRI is increasingly used to guide prostate
biopsies and has potential to spare 500,000 men/year from the side effects of invasive biopsies. Yet, subtle
differences in MRI appearance of aggressive vs. indolent (non-lethal) cancer vs. benign tissue creates three
problems: missed cancers, high rates of false positives, and only moderate inter-reader agreement among ra-
diologists. Selective identification of aggressive and indolent cancers is imperative for reducing cancer
death while minimizing side effects from unneeded biopsies.
We propose to develop and use pathology-based (pathomic) MRI biomarkers in rad-pathomic deep
learning methods to assist radiologists in detecting and localizing aggressive vs. indolent cancers on
prostate MRI. In addition, our proposed method will be the first to localize aggressive and indolent cancers
when they coexist (76% of index lesions). We performed four preliminary studies in our unique dataset of
matched radiology and pathology images. First, we found a high agreement in labeling aggressive vs. indolent
cancers between the automated method and two pathologists. Second, we developed pathomic MRI bi-
omarkers from MRI features that correlate with features derived from pathology images. Third, we used the
biomarkers in rad-pathomic deep learning models to detect cancer (AUC: 0.86) and aggressive cancer (AUC:
0.85) on MRI. Fourth, we showed that combining radiologists and the rad-pathomic deep learning models
helped identify 14% more aggressive cancers missed by radiologists.
Three innovations will improve the localization of aggressive vs. indolent cancers on prostate MRI.
First, we will develop 3D RAPSODI, a novel 3D registration method for 3D reconstructed MRI and pathology
images to eliminate the need for slice-to-slice correspondences and map cancer labels from pathology onto
MRI. Second, we will leverage our correlation learning method to identify pathomic MRI biomarkers. Third, we
will use deep learning models to assist radiologists in localizing aggressive cancer on MRI.
Our multidisciplinary team is uniquely positioned to test whether: (Aim 1) pathomic MRI biomarkers empha-
size the visual differences of aggressive vs. indolent cancers on MRI; (Aim 2) rad-pathomic deep learn-
ing models can reliably and automatically distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancers on
MRI, and (Aim 3) radiologists assisted by deep learning models have increased detection accuracy and
inter-reader agreement than unassisted radiologists.
Impact: Our proposed rad-pathomic deep learning models have the potential to improve prostate cancer care
in three ways: 1) detecting and targeting aggressive cancers that are currently missed in ~50,000 men/year; 2)
eliminating up to 500,000 unnecessary biopsies/year in men with no cancer or indolent cancers; and 3) reduc-
ing the number of biopsy samples needed to detect aggressive cancers (1-2 vs. 12-18 currently)."

The overall objective of the studies proposed in this revised R01 application is to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying regulation of social brain development, a first step in a larger project aimed at
identifying circuit based approaches which improve therapeutics for neurodevelopmental disorders
characterized by social impairments, as well as diseases which may be the consequence of social injury during
brain development. Based on extensive preliminary findings, our overall hypothesis is that developmental
upregulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) signaling constrains social reward learning to a critical period, and
that these functions are enabled by presynaptic AVP receptors in the ventral pallidum (vPD). The goal of this
R01 application is to explore this understudied area and to develop tools to test our hypothesis directly in vivo
and ex vivo. Three specific aims have been proposed to achieve our goal. Specifically: Specific Aim 1: To
map and characterize the AVP neuronal projection from the hypothalamus to the vPD. Here we will test
the hypothesis that the vPD receives a parvocellular AVP neuronal projection from the hypothalamus. Specific
Aim 2: To determine whether AVP evokes synaptic plasticity in the vPD across development. Here we
will test the hypothesis that the magnitude of AVP induced synaptic plasticity in the vPD is increased across
development. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether AVP1a receptors in the vPD are required for
constraining the social reward learning critical period. Here we will test the hypothesis that AVP1a
receptors in the vPD are required for the closure of the social reward learning critical period. We predict these
studies will demonstrate the reciprocal regulation of OT and AVP as a mechanism underlying the
establishment of a critical period for social reward learning. In addition, these studies are designed to identify a
novel manipulation (blockade of the AVP1aR) that can reinstate social reward learning in adulthood, which will
have important implications for future clinical trials of mechanism-based therapies for the treatment of autism,
schizophrenia, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, because these studies characterize a
quantifiable measure of social reward learning (social conditioned place preference) that can be used in both
humans and mice, they dramatically improve the translational validity of these studies for future development
of therapeutic interventions."

This STTR proposal will focus on developing and testing a novel, first-on-the-market implantable biosensor for
in vivo, real-time sensing of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (GLU) for animal studies. GABA
and GLU are neurotransmitters (NTs) that are essential for information processing and plasticity, memory, and
other functions. GLU is the major excitatory NT and GABA is the major inhibitory NT; a proper balance between
them is vital for normal brain function. GLU-GABA dysregulation plays a critical role in several brain disorders,
including epilepsy (a disease affecting 1.2% of Americans), dementia (which will affect 130M worldwide by 2050)
and Parkinson’s (which affects 1.5M Americans today). A fundamental understanding of NT homeostasis
including its temporal components and its role on behavioral events within and across brain areas would lead to
a better understanding of human brain function and to new and more effective treatments. Existing NT sensing
methods measure only one NT at a time, suffer from poor spatiotemporal resolution, are unable to measure NT
dynamics at the circuit level, continuously in real time. Our goal is to develop an ultra-small, flexible (50µm)
neural probe for chronic, direct and simultaneous amperometric detection of GLU&GABA, with sub-second
temporal resolution and with no externally applied reagents. Phase I focused on manufacturing a prototype Si
penetrating shank-type probe with 4 micropatterned sensors and one microfluidic on-demand in-situ calibrator
(ODIC), optimizing the enzyme functionalization process, and performing a feasibility study on the measurement
of physiologically-relevant changes in the levels of GLU&GABA in real time for freely moving rats for up to 2
weeks. The objectives of Phase II are an upgrade of the probe into a brain micromotion-resistant hybrid Si-
flexible polymer probe of higher functionality (octrode + 2 ODIC micro-channels), improvements in selective
functionalization, and validation of the probes in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The multifunctional ODICs
will be applied to perform in-situ calibrations for chronic measurements and to investigate the circuit activity of 3
adjacent cortical layers in the whisker barrel cortex via chemical modulation. Upon completion, we expect to
deliver a unique-on-the-market dual NT probe of excellent reliability and superior sensitivity, selectivity, and
stability, with all performance parameters equal to or better than those offered by current technologies. To
achieve this, Alcorix will partner with experts in amperometric NT sensing research from Louisiana Tech U. and
experts in the manufacture of advanced neuroprobes from NeuroNexus, who will assist with hybrid Si-flexible
polymer integration, in vitro and in vivo evaluation, and eventual market entry. The proposed research will also
enable alternative uses such as point-of-use sensors for neurotoxins or disease bio-markers, and neural signal
recording or neurostimulation in conjunction with specific locally-injected drugs. The 2023 world market for
electrophysiological neuro-probes (Grand View Research) is about $266M, CAGR of 3.1%. If only 1% of that
market can be captured by this technology it would be more than sufficient justification for the proposed work."

 The persistence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in long-lived, latent reservoirs remains one of
the largest barriers to a functional cure. The latent reservoir consists of cells harboring replication-competent,
but transcriptionally inhibited proviruses that evade immune clearance and persist in patients even after decades
of antiretroviral therapy. One of the earliest strategies designed to deplete the latent reservoir was referred to as
“shock and kill,” whereby latently infected cells would be induced to express the virus by treatment with latency
reversing agents (LRAs) and subsequently cleared from the body. While a number of LRAs have since been
described, these agents have been proven to be therapeutically untenable, at least in part due to their incomplete
penetrance and notable stochasticity. The development of new LRAs for better understanding both HIV latency
and transcriptional regulation, as well as for use in next-generation therapeutic strategies, is an NIH HIV/AIDS
high priority research topic (NOT-OD-20-018). Several currently described LRAs work to enhance the efficiency
of transcriptional elongation by directly or indirectly increasing the activity of positive transcription elongation
factor b (P-TEFb). During active HIV infection, the viral Tat protein hijacks P-TEFb and recruits it to sites of
nascent viral transcription. P-TEFb subsequently phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of RNA polymerase II (Pol
II), licensing elongation. Recently, we described a new player in transcriptional elongation, the PAF1 complex or
PAF1C. PAF1C binds to RNA Pol II at sites of transcriptional pausing, preventing P-TEFb recruitment and
effectively applying a ‘parking brake’ to the transcriptional machinery. This is consistent with recent findings that
PAF1C acts as a negative regulator of HIV transcription and a positive regulator of HIV latency. In our preliminary
data, we report the development and initial characterization of a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of PAF1C
nucleation, termed iPAF1C. We show that iPAF1C significantly enhances the reactivation potential of several
distinct LRAs in a cell line model of latency, resulting in enhanced release of RNA Pol II at integrated proviruses
and enhanced transcriptional elongation. In this proposal, we seek to test the hypothesis that small molecule
inhibitors of PAF1C act as effective LRAs by disruption of PAF1C nucleation and release of proximally paused
RNA Pol II at the HIV promoter. First, we will test the efficacy and specificity of iPAF1C in disrupting PAF1C in
J-Lat cells, using these results as benchmarks for further compound optimization (Aim 1). iPAF1C and its lead
analogs will then be tested both individually and in combination with a panel of representative LRAs in a series
of cell line and primary cell models of latency. Synergistic combinations will subsequently be analyzed for
reactivation potential in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV (Aim 2). Ultimately, these
experiments will examine a new axis for reactivation of latent proviruses, providing new molecular probes for the
understanding HIV latency and for the development of next-generation curative strategies."

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and lethal histology, accounting for 80% of
ovarian cancer death. During peritoneal spread, tumor cells detached form multicellular spheroids (MTS),
which survive better unattached and are more resistant to chemotherapy and colonizes better to new sites.
They primarily metastasize into lipid-rich areas such as omentum from which cancer cells rely on fatty acid
oxidation (FAO) for metastatic progression, survival, and drug resistance. Thus, MTS formation and metabolic
adaptation capabilities enable HGSOC cells to adapt in tumor microenvironment and represent critical niches
for urgently needed therapeutic interventions. We recently identified a novel target, apelin receptor (APJ) and
its ligand apelin that confers such adaptabilities of HGSOC, contributing to treatment inefficacy and metastatic
progression. We previously reported the clinical and pathological significance of APJ in promoting HGSOC
metastasis and progression. Our new data show that APJ promotes MTS formation, leading to chemoresistant,
and reducing MTS by APJ inhibition remarkably increased drug efficacy. Also, adipocyte-derived apelin drives
APJ-expressing cancer cells to migrate and invade into lipid-rich tissues, and promote metabolic reprograming
to FAO for high energy production. Human xenografts with stable APJ-knockdown HGSOC demonstrated
significant reduction in metastatic tumor burden. The primary goals of the proposed research are 1) to expand
on our preliminary findings by elucidating the underlying mechanistic roles of MTS formation and metabolism
by APJ and the effects of APJ inhibitors in drug resistance and metastasis; 2) to develop a predictive
computational model that accounts for the unique physio-cellular characteristics of tumors and anatomical
properties in the peritoneal cavity to describe drug transport mechanisms and resulting treatment effects; and
3) leveraging this knowledge to perform the proof-of-concept preclinical evaluation of APJ inhibition in HGSOC
and further guide model-informed drug development of APJ inhibitors. Herein, we propose to investigate
metabolic effects of APJ and its inhibition in established and primary HGSCO and non-HGSOC cell lines (Aim
1). We will investigate the effects of APJ inhibition of MTS formation on drug efficacy and metastasis in vitro
and develop a physiologically-based PK/PD model for peritoneal tumors (Aim 2). We will evaluate the effects of
APJ inhibitors alone or combining with chemotherapy in preclinical metastasis models of HGSOC (Aim 3). To
accomplish thes goals we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in cancer pharmacology
and computation modeling (Sukyung Woo); basic research and metabolic pathways of ovarian cancer
(Resham Bhattacharya); ovarian cell and mouse model (Raya Huang); and translational and clinical ovarian
research and immunotherapy (Kunle Odunsi). Successful completion of this study will establish the apelin/APJ
axis as an important therapeutic target in HGSOC and provide scientific basis for APJ inhibitors used in
combination with standard-of-care cytotoxics in cytoreductive therapy or as maintenance therapy."

Chronic pain is a significant social and economic burden. Despite considerable progress over the last several
decades of research, our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of chronic pain remains
incomplete and this presents obstacles for improvement in pain management. Multimodal investigations into
the mechanistic heterogeneity within and across chronic pain conditions are critical for the development of new
and efficacious precision pain treatments.
The central nervous system (CNS) governs the perception of pain. Sensitization of the CNS is a mechanism
hypothesized to underly the increased pain and sensory sensitivity observed in patients with chronic pain. This
mechanism is referred to as nociplastic pain. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are methods that can be used
together to build multimodal profiles that characterize the degree and features of an individual’s nociplastic
pain phenotype. The proposed F99 and K00 projects will use these methods to distinguish convergent and
divergent nociplastic mechanisms across diagnostically distinct somatic (emanating from bones and soft
tissue) and visceral (emanating from internal organs) chronic pain conditions.
The overall objective for the proposed project is to identify shared and distinct nociplastic profiles between
somatic and visceral pain conditions to ultimately stimulate the development of precision pain management
tools. The goal of the F99 portion is to characterize sensory and neurobiological features of nociplastic pain in
patients with somatic pain, including those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and carpal tunnel
syndrome (CTS), relative to healthy controls and patients with fibromyalgia – the archetypal nociplastic pain
condition. This analysis will build a foundation for the long-term aim of this work’s K00 portion, where parallel
sensory and neurobiological measures will be assessed in patients with visceral pain, including those with
urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), overactive bladder (OAB), and gynecological chronic pelvic
pain (CPP). Data from the NIDDK-funded Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain
(MAPP) Research Network and Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) will be leveraged
to complete the K00 project. Together, the mentoring and research activities of this F99 and K00 work will

10746210,"Background: Lung cancer screening (LCS) with annual computed tomography can reduce lung cancer
mortality, but <10% of the estimated 1 million eligible Veterans have been screened, with lower rates among
Black people. Many barriers prevent Black people from engaging in LCS: lack of awareness of LCS or how to
access it, stigma, fatalistic expectations about lung cancer, power differentials with providers, mistrust of VA,
limited self-efficacy, and adverse social determinants of health [entrenched by structural racism]. As a result,
across the US LCS uptake is 50% lower [and adherence is 20% lower] among Black vs white persons.
Significance: Fourteen Veterans die of lung cancer each day (5000/year), and Black men have the highest
incidence and mortality in the US. To improve equity, the 2022 President’s Cancer Panel recommends using
trained community peers (known in VA as Peer Specialists, or “Peers”) to reach vulnerable individuals where
they are and support them in engaging in cancer screening. Our overarching hypothesis for this line of
research is that community outreach, education, and tailored one-to-one support delivered by Veteran Peers
can address barriers that prevent Black Veterans from accessing LCS, thereby closing disparities.
Innovation & Impact: We will use co-design with Black Veterans, Peers, and community partners to develop
an innovative, Veteran-centered intervention (Peer-led program) that meets the needs of Black Veterans. No
prior research has tested VA Peer Specialists in such a role. This work is tightly aligned with Office of
Research & Development priorities on health equity and precision oncology. The 2022 HSR&D priorities call
for health equity studies and for pilot studies testing strategies for Veteran and community engagement.
Specific Aims: This pilot project has the following aims: 1) Co-design the Peer-led program in partnership with
Veterans and community stakeholders; 2) Assess feasibility and acceptability of the Peer-led program; and 3)
[Establish feasibility of study procedures].
Methodology: In Aim 1, we will convene a virtual co-design team of 1-2 Peers and 5-7 Black LCS-eligible
Veterans from across the US, [including at least 2 Black women and Veterans varying in age, ethnicity, and
geographic residence. Using best practices for equity-centered co-design], we will create a plan and messages
for community outreach, content for group LCS orientation, and the process for one-to-one Peer coaching and
navigation to support Black Veterans to engage in LCS. We will seek input from our community partners, [the
National Association for Black Veterans and Tri-Ad Veterans League], external Veteran advisory panels, and
LCS clinical staff to ensure relatability beyond our team and fit with clinical workflow. In Aim 2, we will conduct
a feasibility pilot test of the Peer-led program. The Peer will lead up to 4 group LCS orientations in community
partner sites to reach ~40 LCS-eligible Black Veterans. The Peer will provide one-to-one tailored support to 15
Veterans (e.g., coaching, goal-setting, navigation to access VA LCS). We will evaluate program delivery with
Peer periodic reflections and activity logs. We will interview Veteran participants, community partners, and LCS
clinical staff to explore feasibility and acceptability of the Peer-led program and solicit suggestions for
improvement. Aim 3 will pilot test and refine study procedures to be used in the IIR: enrolling Veterans;
administering surveys to assess change in Social Cognitive Theory constructs; and extracting LCS uptake and
tobacco treatment 3 months post-enrollment from VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse.
Next Steps/Implementation: This work will inform a multi-site stepped-wedge trial (IIR) to assess
effectiveness, implementation, and cost of the Peer-led program in VA LCS sites and neighboring [branches of
the National Association for Black Veterans]. Our operational partners in the National Center for Lung Cancer
Screening, Office of Health Equity, and Peer Specialist Services are committed to disseminate the Peer-led
program to reduce disparities in LCS and lung cancer outcomes, in line with VA’s 2022-28 Strategic Plan."

Women accounted for 18% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2020 and yet only 7.4% of the pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users. Additionally, 71% of the women diagnosed with HIV in 2020 were
Black/African American or Hispanic. PrEP has been shown to reduce incident HIV infection, providing a
substantial public health opportunity to work towards the US Department of Health and Human Services
announced the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. However, a substantial component of risk of HIV infection for
women relates to the behaviors of their male sex partners, and these risks of partners may be unknown to
women. Additionally, the completeness of data on race/ethnicity in key datasets used to document PrEP users
in the US is limited leading to bias in our estimates. The proposed analysis will (1) determine the characteristics
of women based on their partnerships that are indications for PrEP, particularly those indications unrecognized
by women and their healthcare providers, 2) use multiple imputation to complete race/ethnicity data in current
pharmaceutical use datasets to better understand the current racial/ethnic distribution of women PrEP users,
and 3) analyze spatio-temporal patterns of PrEP uptake among women in the United States. Taken together,
the goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of among whom PrEP is needed, racial/ethnicity
distributions among whom PrEP is currently being utilized, and where uptake is disparate considering risk factors
for HIV infection."

Unhealthy alcohol use plays a major role in risk for and exacerbation of HIV/AIDS. There is an urgent need to
implement effective alcohol intervention strategies, train new researchers, and reduce ongoing health
disparities in order to end the HIV epidemic. Addressing these critical issues, this K24 renewal application
proposes to extend the mentoring program in patient-oriented research (POR) of Dr. Derek Satre, Professor in
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and
Adjunct Investigator in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research (DOR). Dr. Satre’s
research program is focused on alcohol interventions in the context of HIV care, including serious
comorbidities such other substance use, mental health problems, and medical conditions. In the current K24
cycle, Dr. Satre has met and exceeded the aims of the award and been highly productive: he has published 75
papers (36 with mentees as first author) and obtained two R01s in HIV and alcohol research based in health
systems. His mentees are primarily clinicians and they have been very successful in their research careers,
including two K awards with Dr. Satre as primary mentor, and many other mentees have received NIH grants
and faculty positions. This renewal will enhance Dr. Satre’s ability to develop, and implement effective alcohol
interventions with people with HIV (PWH) especially racial/ethnic minorities, who are disproportionately
impacted. His mentoring will continue to be based in alcohol and HIV health settings and outstanding training
programs. New in this renewal, he proposes to develop an innovative alcohol POR mentoring program within
the UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) Visiting Professor Program, to enhance the careers of
underrepresented minority junior scientists. Mentees will leverage the infrastructure and resources of Dr.
Satre’s ongoing studies, which include large alcohol and HIV data sets and multidisciplinary research
collaborators. Dr. Satre proposes to further enhance his clinical POR mentoring by obtaining training in
implementation science and social determinants of health. The proposed research to be conducted with
mentees extends his recently funded R01 to examine alcohol risk profiles, access to alcohol treatment and HIV
clinical outcomes, to inform alcohol intervention implementation. In summary, this K24 renewal will leverage
Dr. Satre’s research mentoring program with extensive infrastructure at UCSF and DOR to support a program
of expanded POR mentoring in alcohol and HIV intervention research, to advance the goal of implementing
effective interventions to reduce alcohol-related problems for PWH."

New initiatives in global genomics research escalate the urgency of questions of just inclusion and equitable
practice of science. To address these challenges, explicit framings of justice and equity are required to move
beyond ambiguous and inconsistent policies and approaches, and anchor greater transparency in
negotiations between different stakeholders. Additionally, the increasingly global and multi-institutional
nature of genomics research requires understanding of the multiple legal, regulatory, and institutional
ecosystems that condition the possibilities for equitable partnership and benefit-sharing with participants and
communities. Building on Nancy Fraser’s framework of justice that focuses on recognition, representation,
and redistribution, we explore the complex, multi-level nature of barriers to equity in genomics research with
particular attention to the influence of legal and institutional infrastructures on issues such as study
governance, benefit sharing, data control, and ownership. This proposal builds on our research of the pursuit
of diversity in precision medicine research, where we found that institutional practices constrain possibilities
for benefits and create challenges for equitable partnerships in genomics research seeking to engage
historically underrepresented populations. We seek to contribute to a conceptual understanding of the
principle of justice, empirical possibilities for its realization in the equitable distribution of benefits, and
practical implications for research institutions and infrastructure. To achieve these objectives, we will: 1)
examine facilitators and barriers to negotiating agreements between research institutions and communities
around justice, benefit, and equity in genomics research by investigating (a) legal, regulatory, commercial,
and ethical frameworks and policies, and (b) stakeholder perspectives on and experiences with negotiations
of agreements; and 2) use a stakeholder-engaged process to develop resources to identify points of
negotiation for equitable and just partnerships between communities and research institutions."
10745300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The central nervous system is made up a vast number of neurons connected into the circuits that underlie all
brain function. Precise circuit assembly is accomplished, in part, through axonal target selection, mediated by
cell surface molecules (CSMs) that serve as recognition tags to identify appropriate synaptic partners. However,
the sheer volume of synapses that must be constructed for a healthy brain outstrips the number of available
coding genes by orders of magnitude. One way to mitigate this challenge is through molecular gradients such
that connections are specified by a relative amount of one molecule instead of by individual molecules. Another
is to reuse the same CSMs in different anatomical regions. The goal of this proposal is to leverage the
stereotyped, topographical connections of the extended hippocampal network to examine if one receptor-ligand
CSM pair can mediate precise assembly of all nodes of a functional circuit. The extended hippocampal network
consists of connections between CA1, subiculum (Sub), entorhinal cortex (EC), mammillary nucleus (mMN), and
the anteroventral thalamus (AVT). Each node is further subdivided into parallel medial and lateral hippocampal
networks (MHN and LHN, respectively). By postnatal day 8 (P8), all five of these regions have inverse gradients
of the CSMs, Teneurin-3 (Ten-3) and Latrophilin-2 (Lphn-2), restricted to MHN and LHN, respectively. This
complementary expression suggests a ‘Ten3→Ten3, Lphn2→Lphn2’ connectivity rule. In fact, for the CA1→Sub
projection, Ten3-expressing CA1 axons appear to be attracted to Sub-derived Ten3 and repelled by Sub-derived
Lphn2 to precisely target the MHN subdivision of CA1. Conversely, Lphn2-expressing CA1 axons are repelled
by Sub-derived Ten3 to target the LHN. Circuit-wide inverse Ten3 and Lphn2 expression suggests these
mechanisms could be reused broadly. This proposal will assess if the mechanisms of Ten3 homophilic
attraction and Ten3-Lphn2 heterophilic repulsion are recapitulated at each anatomical node within the
extended hippocampal network to mediate precise topographical circuit assembly. Using a combination
of genetic and viral techniques, Ten3 or Lphn2 will be conditionally deleted from each origin and target region in
a series of loss of function manipulations followed by viral circuit-tracing to assess mistargeting. This study
represents the first test of a single receptor-ligand pair mediating the circuit assembly of an entire functional
network. Disruption in wiring is a hallmark of many neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders, so elucidating
the molecular mechanisms of circuit assembly may lead to therapeutic strategies pertinent to the NIMH mission.
Along with the research aims in this proposal, this fellowship will support additional training technical expertise,
scientific writing, mentorship, and career development. Stanford University will provide the ideal well-equipped,
intellectually diverse, and collaborative environment to complete the proposed study."
10745345,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Methamphetamine (meth) is a powerfully addictive psychostimulant capable of causing neuronal damage.
Recent studies by my mentor, Dr. Graves, found that meth increases mitochondrial stress in the axons of
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons resulting from MAO metabolism of cytosolic DA.
Pilot studies showed similar effects in the axons of Locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons. Using
a 28-day meth administration paradigm, recent studies by Dr. Graves found degeneration of SNc DA neurons
and that pharmacological inhibition of MAO was neuroprotective. Pilot studies similarly show chronic meth-
induced LC degeneration that is attenuated by MAO inhibition. These data suggest that axonal MAO-
dependent mitochondrial stress contributes to chronic meth-induced degeneration. The overarching goal of
this proposal is to determine the progression and presentation of degeneration, whether neuronal (as opposed
to astrocytic) MAO enzymes are necessary for degeneration, and the behavioral consequences of chronic
meth-induced SNc and LC degeneration. My central hypothesis is that chronic meth induces a neuronal
MAO-dependent dying-back pattern of SNc and LC degeneration resulting in cognitive impairment and
will be tested in the following aims: Aim 1: Determine if chronic meth produces a dying-back pattern of SNc
and LC degeneration. Meth increases axonal, but not somatic MAO-dependent mitochondrial stress, and MAO
inhibition prevented chronic meth-induced SNc and LC degeneration; these data suggest that MAO-dependent
axonal mitochondrial stress drives degeneration. I therefore hypothesize that chronic meth will produce a
dying-back pattern of SNc and LC degeneration, where axonal loss precedes somatic loss. Aim 2: Determine
if neuronal MAO is necessary for chronic meth-induced SNc and LC degeneration. Studies show systemic
MAO inhibition prevented chronic meth-induced SNc and LC degeneration, but MAO enzymes are expressed
in neurons and astrocytes. Given that meth increased mitochondrial stress in SNc and LC axons, I hypothesize
that neuronal MAO is necessary for degeneration. Aim 3: Determine the behavioral consequences of chronic
meth-induced SNc and LC degeneration. SNc degeneration and LC lesioning are associated with impairments
in novel object recognition and context-associated fear conditioning assays, respectively; I therefore
hypothesize that chronic meth-induced degeneration of the SNc and LC will lead to similar behavioral
impairments. I will test my hypotheses by training in and using immunofluorescence, unbiased stereological
assessment of neuronal and axonal degeneration, behavioral analysis, and both genetic and pharmacological
inhibition of MAO enzymes. Testing my hypotheses will provide me with outstanding technical and conceptual
training as a research scientist. Completion of proposed aims will improve our understanding of the
neurodegenerative consequences of chronic meth, expanding knowledge of catecholaminergic degeneration
and providing value to the study of disorders involving similar degeneration."
10745354,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Staphylococcus aureus causes community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias that drive a decline
in lung function and an increased risk of mortality, especially in patients with preexisting lung disease. These
infections are difficult to eradicate because S. aureus can transition to adaptive phenotypes like persister cells
and biofilm, which protect the bacteria against host phagocytes and antimicrobial factors, as well as antibiotics.
A key component of the host immune response to pathogens is the production of regulatory metabolites like
itaconate, which is synthesized in immune cells by the enzyme Immune-Responsive Gene 1 (Irg1). Itaconate
balances pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling in host immune cells and exerts metabolic stress on bacteria. We
recently demonstrated that itaconate inhibits S. aureus glycolysis and restructures staphylococcal metabolism
to promote biofilm formation. Itaconate also limited the use of key energy-producing pathways, suggesting that
it may promote the formation of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells. The role of itaconate in driving S. aureus lung
infections cannot be completely understood without also investigating its impact on the host response to S.
aureus. Preliminary data demonstrate that Irg1 is highly expressed in neutrophils and is associated with
increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production during S. aureus lung infection, which differs from the anti-
inflammatory effects of itaconate that have been defined in other cell types and infection models.
 This proposal aims to further investigate itaconate as a central mediator of the host-pathogen dynamic
during S. aureus lung infection and a potential driver of S. aureus adaptation to the lung. Aim 1 will define the
role of itaconate in regulating the host immune response to S. aureus by using metabolomics, phagocytosis
assays, oxidative burst assays, and scRNA-sequencing to 1) determine if neutrophils are a major source of
itaconate during S. aureus infection, 2) define the impact of itaconate on neutrophil effector function, and 3)
identify the pathways that are differentially regulated by itaconate in neutrophils and other immune cell
populations during in vivo infection. Aim 2 will define the role of itaconate in driving S. aureus adaptation to the
lung by using bacterial qRT-PCR, ATP quantification, antibiotic tolerance assays, and flow cytometry to 1)
determine if itaconate drives transcriptional changes that promote persister cell formation in vivo, 2) establish
that itaconate exposure drives reduced energy metabolism and increased antibiotic tolerance ex vivo, and 3)
quantify S. aureus division and growth in response to itaconate in vivo. Together, these studies will define the
role of host immunometabolism in driving inflammation and bacterial persistence during S. aureus lung infection."
10914267,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colorectal cancers (CRC) are characterized as having a hierarchical organization requiring proliferating and
de-differentiated stem cells to maintain tumor growth and progression. Cellular plasticity underlying colorectal
cancer is essential for a process which occurs following selective pressures of the tumor microenvironment
and chemotherapeutics. The colonic tumor microenvironment is characterized by extreme hypoxia due to the
anoxic lumen. Hypoxia promotes metabolic rewiring, and such processes are utilized by cancer cells to support
biosynthesis, cell survival and dynamic alteration in cell fates. A critical feature of cellular metabolism is
organellar interaction and coordination, yet how these contribute to CRC plasticity, survival, progression and
treatment response are unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS) are the most
abundant inter-organellar interaction. I generated a panel of ERMCS reporter CRC cell lines, and through
unbiased high content imaging and CRISPR screens, I have identified essential mechanisms required for ER-
mitochondrial interactions in CRC. Moreover, I show a key role of tumor hypoxia in modulating ERMCS.
Hypoxia inhibited mitochondrial complex III and IV to decrease ERMCS. Treating cells with the mitochondrial
electron carrier, coenzyme (CoQ) rescued ERMCS suppression following hypoxia. I hypothesize that tumor
hypoxia regulates ER-mitochondrial contacts (ERMCS) by altering mitochondrial respiration and CoQ redox for
metabolic adaptation and survival. In aim 1 (F99 phase), I will focus on identifying the molecular mechanism of
hypoxia dependent ERMCS inhibition and expand into in vivo models with our novel ERMCS reporter mouse
model. During the K00 phase, I will apply knowledge gained during graduate school in cancer metabolism and
organellar interaction to an independent postdoctoral project. The plasticity of colorectal tumor epithelium
depends on integration of organellar functions to sustain metabolic demands. Therefore, my goal as a
postdoctoral fellow is to understand the dynamic changes and requirement for organellar interactions and
metabolic compartmentalization during cell fates alterations in CRC. I plan to use genetic murine and primary
patient organoid models of CRC, volumetric electron microscopy, in vivo organellar metabolomics, and
functional CRISPR screens to answer these questions. Lastly, in addition to the proposed studies, this training
plan includes activities important for career development, mentorship, networking, and scientific
communication to prepare me for successful transition to a postdoctoral fellowship and my career as an
independent investigator studying cancer metabolism."
10778533,"Rituximab (RTX) and other anti-CD20 antibodies (ofatumumab and obinutuzumab (OBN)) dramatically
improved treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Alone or in
combination with chemotherapy (e.g. R-CHOP, a combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone) they produced better clinical outcomes. However, relapses frequently occur with
poor patient outcomes. In 2017 in the USA, there were an estimated 72,240 new cases of NHL and 20,140
deaths, 20,110 new cased of CLL and 4,660 deaths in both males and females. This demonstrates the need
for improved treatment strategies. The goal of the proposed studies is to design, synthesize, and evaluate the
second generation of drug-free macromolecular therapeutics (DFMT) for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.
Anti-CD20 antibodies are divided into Type I such as RTX and Type II such as OBN; they have different
patterns of binding to CD20 receptor. RTX binds between CD20 tetramers resulting in accumulation in lipid
rafts, calcium influx and caspase activation. OBN binds within one tetramer with the conformation compatible
with homotypic adhesion regions, leading to actin cytoskeleton remodeling and lysosome disruption. Our
design enhances the activity of Type II OBN by triggering the apoptosis activation pathways of both types of
antibodies. This new system is composed of two nanoconjugates: a) bispecific engager, OBN-MORF1 (OBN
conjugated to one morpholino oligonucleotide MORF1); and b) a crosslinking (effector) component HSA-
(MORF2)X (human serum albumin (HSA) grafted with multiple copies of complementary morpholino
oligonucleotide 2). Modification of OBN with one MORF1 does not impact the binding of OBN-MORF1 to
CD20 and following binding to CD20 Type II effects occur. Further exposure to multivalent effector HSA-
(MORF2)X results in clustering the OBN-MORF1-CD20 complexes into lipid rafts and Type I effects occur.
This new approach, called “clustered OBN (cOBN)” combines effects of both antibody types resulting in very
high apoptotic levels. In the bispecific engager, MORF1 will be attached to OBN via thioether bond following
reduction of OBN's disulfide bonds. The structure of the multivalent crosslinking effector HSA-(MORF2)x will
be optimized to ensure the highest efficiency of the cOBN system on disseminated models of NHL. Recently,
combination of OBN with chlorambucil was FDA approved. We have shown that HSA-based DFMT sensitizes
NHL cells to different chemotherapeutic agents. Thus we plan to evaluate the impact of combining cOBN with
chemotherapeutics on the mechanism and efficiency of apoptosis induction. Finally, we demonstrated
efficacy of DFMT on resistant lymphomas and cells isolated from patients diagnosed with various subtypes of
B cell malignancies. We shall identify subsets of patients that respond favorably to our new therapeutics. In
summary, this proposal is scientifically novel and has great translational potential. Also, it provides a new
paradigm for the design of macromolecular therapeutics applicable to other diseases beyond lymphomas."
10778614,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Seasonal influenza is associated with up to 650,000 respiratory deaths per year worldwide. Influenza A virus
injures the lung to cause the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Influenza A virus-induced ARDS
carries a mortality rate approaching 40% despite advances in anti-viral therapies and supportive care, with most
patients succumbing to intensive care unit (ICU) complications as they recover from the initial infection. In mice,
dysregulated repair leads to widespread and persistent alveolar epithelial abnormalities following severe
influenza A. We reason that activation of repair pathways during recovery from severe influenza will shorten the
duration of time that patients require the ICU, thus mitigating the ICU’s attendant morbidity and mortality.
CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are required to coordinate resolution of lung inflammation and repair of
lung damage in mouse models. These cells appear in the alveolar spaces of patients with ARDS and display
epigenetic and transcriptional profiles predicted by murine experiments. In the injured lung, Treg cells exert
myriad pro-recovery functions, including generation of pro-epithelial molecules such as amphiregulin, the loss of
which worsens influenza A-induced acute lung injury in mice. Within Treg cells, the DNA methylation pattern at
specific genomic loci controls their identity and suppressive function. The epigenetic regulator protein Uhrf1 plays
an essential role in maintaining cell type-specific DNA methylation signatures. The necessity of Uhrf1 in
maintaining Treg cell identity and pro-repair function during the recovery phase of influenza A remains unknown.
Likewise, the necessity of amphiregulin in inducing healthy epithelial repair during the recovery phase is also
undefined. We hypothesize that Treg cells require Uhrf1 to maintain their pro-repair function and
amphiregulin to induce epithelial repair during recovery from severe influenza A virus infection. We
propose three Specific Aims, which use innovative approaches to test our hypothesis, including cutting-edge
murine systems, novel computational platforms, and a human case-control study that will translate our findings
to the bedside. Aim 1 will determine whether Uhrf1 is necessary to maintain Treg cell transcriptional programs
and pro-repair function during recovery from influenza A. Aim 2 will ascertain the necessity of Treg cell-generated
amphiregulin in promoting repair during recovery from influenza A-induced lung injury. Aim 3 will determine
whether transcriptional and epigenetic signatures in alveolar Treg cells are associated with 30-day mortality in
selected patients with severe viral pneumonia. Our proposal will establish causal evidence linking drug-
targetable mechanisms to detailed physiologic readouts. Elucidating these causal links will inform the
development of pro-recovery therapeutic approaches for severe influenza and other causes of ARDS."
10762975,"In the eye, complex retinal circuits are wired together for precise neural computation. The diverse but precise
wiring between interneurons and retinal ganglion cells serve as the structural basis for circuit processing of
different visual features. These parallel circuits are wired up precisely, as defects may lead to several eye
diseases and neurological disorders. To investigate the mechanisms behind how diverse neuronal types
precisely integrate into distinct parallel retinal circuits, we developed methods that allow for targeted genetic
access of the unique On-Off direction-selective circuit, which conveys direction-selectivity signals, as the ideal
model system. Our previous studies now position us to examine the role of Type II Cadherins (Cdhs) in
assembling this circuit as individual proteins or in combinations. We showed that two Cdhs, Cdh9 and Cdh8,
instruct parallel ON and OFF bipolar cell input to ON vs. OFF sublaminae of the ON-OFF direction-selective
circuit, thus allowing precise segregation of ON and OFF channels. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying this assembly remain elusive. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential
functions of Cdh9 vs. Cdh8, we will perform a series of anatomical and functional analyses. We will identify the
specific portion of the cadherin molecule, extracellular versus intracellular domains, that are responsible for
their distinct functions, as well as the specific timing of their actions in forming synapses between bipolar cells
and ganglion cells. We also found that Cdh9 from bipolar neurons heterophilically recognizes the two closely-related Cdhs, Cdh6 and Cdh10, from postsynaptic Ventral-pointing ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells
(ooDSGCs) and starburst amacrine cells (SACs). We will use this established genetic system to reveal how
combinatorial Cdhs act together to wire up parallel direction-selective circuits. We will examine genetically and
functionally how Cdh6-9-10 single, double, and triple combinations pattern the Ventral-ooDSGC interaction
with SACs. To further expand our understanding of the combinatorial cadherin code in neuronal patterning, we
will test the role of Cdh11, which is identified as a Nasal-pointing ooDSGC enriched gene through molecular
profiling. Thus, we will generate new molecularly and genetically targeted methods to examine the roles of
Cdh11 and its closely related Cdh8 in the wiring of Nasal-pointing direction-selective circuits. Furthermore, we
established an in utero injection system to ectopically introduce individual Type II Cdhs onto Ventral-ooDSGCs or Nasal-ooDSGCs to pinpoint combinatorial Cdhs in regulating DS-circuit patterning. Collectively,
our studies seek to reveal how Cdh combinations control the formation of parallel but distinct DS circuits.
Comprehensive studies on Type II Cdh function would be a major advance for a long-standing question in
mammalian neural development. These studies will be a major step forward in understanding how multiple
genes interact to specify the wiring of complex neural circuits. The identified mechanisms will have significant
relevance to selective circuit wiring throughout the central nervous system."
10930137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, BioStrategies LC proposes to advance the development of a novel AAV-
based gene therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA, also known as Sanfilippo A syndrome). In
contrast to other gene therapies in development for MPS IIIA, BioStrategies’ approach is designed to achieve a
systemic therapeutic effect, including delivery of a functional replacement enzyme across the blood brain barrier
(BBB) without intrathecal or intraventricular administration. Further development and commercialization of
BioStrategies’ gene therapy has the potential to deliver the first and only clinically effective treatment for
MPS IIIA, potentially rescuing patients from the debilitating degenerative effects and early mortality associated
with this genetic disorder. It would also serve as strong proof-of-principle for a new approach to gene therapy in
a broad array of other genetic disorders that require the delivery of functional enzymes to the central nervous
system in addition to the periphery. In preliminary studies, BioStrategies developed a novel approach that would
use AAV-based gene therapy to deliver genes to the liver or other organs outside of the CNS to produce
functional SGSH combined with non-toxic carbohydrate-binding subunit B of ricin (RTB), a lectin that has strong
affinity for a broad array of glycoproteins and glycolipids on mammalian cell surfaces. This RTB fusion protein is
designed to infiltrate multiple tissues, including crossing the BBB to achieve therapeutic levels in the brain. In
animal models of MPS IIIA, intravenous administration of this SGSH:RTB fusion protein reliably and robustly
achieved broad distribution, including across the BBB, restoring heparan sulfate to wild-type levels in the brain
and peripheral tissues. The team then demonstrated that AAV-based gene therapy targeting the liver achieved
continuous production of SGSH:RTB, with broad distribution and reversal of the MPS IIIA phenotype in brain
and peripheral tissues. In this Direct-to-Phase II, BioStrategies now proposes to assess the utility of an array of
AAV vectors to optimize SGSH:RTB production and distribution in vivo followed by robust, fully-powered efficacy
testing of the best performing AAV construct in an MPS IIIA model. Aim 1. Optimize SGSH:RTB product
design, transfection efficacy, and safety. Milestone: Select a lead candidate based on a decision matrix that
prioritizes the highest efficacy in the CNS with the lowest dose, best safety profile, and commercialization
potential (full details on decision considerations provided in the Research Strategy). Aim 2. Evaluate preclinical
efficacy of AAV-based SGSH:RTB gene therapy in MPS IIIA mice. Milestones: Demonstrate that an
intravenously-delivered AAV-based SGSH:RTB gene therapy 1) establishes continuous production of
SGSH:RTB, 2) achieves therapeutic-levels in brain and other organs/tissues of interest, 3) prevents progression
of the MPS IIIA phenotype (i.e., behavior, histopathology, survival) compared to controls, 4 ) is safe over an 8-
month period of observation, and 5) extends longevity."
10761494,"Within the United States, 500,000+ individuals are enduring the long-term consequences of severe burn injuries
covering 20% or more of their body surface area, with upwards to 11,000 individuals experiencing such an injury
per year. These burn injuries severely compromise body temperature regulation, owing to permanent
impairments of the primary heat-dissipating mechanisms, namely profoundly blunted skin blood flow and
sweating in the injured skin. Furthermore, well-healed burn survivors exhibit greater all-cause mortality; more
hospitalization days for “circulatory diseases” including heart disease, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease;
and have elevated incidences of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. For more than 20
years, the PI has investigated the adverse consequences of severe burn injuries while focusing on two primary
goals: a) providing important information to the burn survivor and their caregivers, targeted at improving the
quality of life for burn survivors, and b) provide research-verified findings directed at reducing the elevated
morbidity and mortality risk in well-healed burn survivors. Consistent with those goals, the objective of this MIRA
application is to extend our discoveries, and associated understanding, of the cardiovascular and
thermoregulatory consequences of a severe burn injury in humans and to pursue avenues to mitigate any such
adverse consequences. Though specific aims are not permitted in MIRA applications, examples of research
directions that could be pursued include quantifying cardiovascular function/dysfunction very early after a severe
burn injury (e.g., within the first ~48 hours post-burn), at discharge from the hospital post-burn, and months after
discharge; assessments of cardiac and renal stress due to physical activity in warm to hot environmental
conditions in well-healed burn survivors while exploring avenues to mitigate any adverse responses; and perhaps
identify the limits that a severe burn injury places on well-healed burn survivors’ thermoregulatory and
cardiovascular capabilities to withstand adverse conditions associated with heat waves while also exploring
approaches to mitigate such adverse responses. These research efforts will provide valuable information that
will culminate in the reduction in otherwise heightened morbidity and mortality burden of burn survivors, along
with associated improvements in cardiometabolic health, a greater ability to work and perform functions of daily
living, improved quality of life, and enhanced independence as they age."

with multiple other viral factors. In many cases, however, the mechanistic consequence and significance of
those interactions is unknown. Similarly, cytoplasmic envelopment depends upon interactions made by a
few essential tegument proteins (VP16, pUL36 and pUL37 in HSV-1), but which of their interactions (other
than with each other) are important for this process is unknown despite a wide array of interaction partners
identified by proteomic and other approaches. Here we propose to use a novel directed evolution
approach for functional identification of crucial interactions. We replace an essential HSV gene with its
homolog from VZV and then perform a growth selection for viruses that can use the VZV homolog for
assembly. Mapping of the mutations that have occurred during this directed evolution can identify novel
functional interactions and establish the significance of others. We present preliminary data showing the
utility of this approach using a chimeric virus in which HSV-1 UL34 is replaced by VZV ORF24. We have
identified a novel functional interaction with HSV-1 ICP4 and validated the significance of a previously
reported interaction with ICP22. We propose to determine the mechanism of action of these critical
interactions and use the system to identify others. In addition, we propose to expand the use of this system
another gene target relevant to nuclear egress, pUL31."

Cell division is orchestrated by the mitotic spindle, composed of hundreds of thousands of microtubules (MT).
Since the discovery of the MT building block tubulin 50 years ago, scientists have puzzled over how the mitotic
spindle assembles via MTs and executes chromosome segregation despite a MT turnover of seconds. Now we
know that spindle assembly relies largely on MT nucleation. Yet, when, where, and how MTs are nucleated, and
how they are subsequently incorporated into the bipolar spindle, remains unclear.
 Based on my discovery of branching MT nucleation, my laboratory contributed to understanding how several
essential factors, namely the protein complex augmin, the phase-separating protein TPX2, and the nucleator g-
TuRC, conduct this reaction. Meanwhile it has been shown that this mechanism creates a majority of MTs in a
spindle. As a result of this work, we are in an ideal position to investigate how branching MT nucleation is
incorporated into spindle assembly to produce a continuous MT framework supporting chromosome segregation.
We will pursue three aims: Aim 1: Determine where, when, and how MTs form in the vicinity of
chromosomes. We will observe exactly where and when MTs form at purified chromosomes in Xenopus egg
extract. We developed a novel assay to visualize MT nucleation from chromosomes, a direct visualization that
is difficult to do in living cells. Further, we will define the contribution toward MT generation of the RanGTP
pathway, branching MT nucleation, the chromosomal passenger complex, and the kinetochore. We hypothesize
that branching MT nucleation is the main source of MTs from chromosomes. Aim 2: Elucidate how importins
regulate onset of branching microtubule nucleation. RanGTP releases the spindle assembly factor TPX2
from importins, which then stimulates branching MT nucleation. Previous studies assumed that TPX2 exists as
a monomer. In contrast, we recently showed that the active form of TPX2 undergoes a liquid liquid phase
separation (LLPS), and importins inhibit this TPX2 condensate. How importins achieve inhibition of TPX2’s LLPS
is not only important for MT assembly but also widely relevant in cell biology, as few studies have described how
inhibition of LLPS can regulate cellular function. We will further assess whether the second essential branching
factor, augmin, is also regulated by RanGTP, a pathway that would provide additional control for cell-cycle
regulation. Aim 3: Provide mechanistic insight into the core branching factor augmin. To determine the
structural basis of augmin-medidated branching MT nucleation, we will solve the single particle cryo-EM structure
of augmin. This work will reveal the location and fold of augmin’s eight subunits. Using structure-function
analysis, we will investigate the functional interfaces through which augmin binds to MTs and g-TuRC, besides
interrogating how augmin and TPX2 interact. Achieving these aims will help answer open and pressing questions
in cell biology about how MT nucleation occurs in the correct location and at the correct time to assemble the
mitotic spindle."

 Experiencing mental health problems during adolescence is associated with symptom worsening and
recurrence later in life, as well as poorer physical health and increased risk for preventable chronic diseases.
Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) has been shown to support key skills and capacities that may protect
against mental health challenges, including emotion regulation (ER) and mindfulness. Yet, MBI effects on health
and wellbeing outcomes in adolescents are generally small and inconsistent across studies. Theory and
empirical evidence suggest that engagement, a multidimensional construct referring to the degree of productive
involvement with an activity, may be a key change process underlying the effect of MBI on target intervention
processes (i.e., ER and mindfulness). The proposed study will be the first to rigorously test engagement as a
mechanism of MBI in adolescents. The specific aims are to (1) Test longitudinal and time-ordered change
associations for engagement and target processes (ER and mindfulness) and (2) Utilize an embedded,
sequential mixed-methods design to identify factors that facilitate and impede adolescent engagement in MBI.
These aims will be tested in N=75 community adolescents participating in a single-arm trial of MBI on mental
health and stress physiology. The current proposal is a novel extension of the parent study that incorporates
longitudinal structural equation modeling and mixed methods to conduct a mechanistic examination of
adolescent engagement in MBI. The proposal is designed to advance the candidate’s long-term career goal of
leading research that deepens our understanding of the mechanisms of MBI and strengthens the science of its
implementation, ultimately through supporting communities in effectively implementing and evaluating MBI for
themselves. The training objectives are to: a) Develop the skills to analyze repeated measures to rigorously test
engagement as a mechanism of MBI, b) Gain training in the integration of qualitative and quantitative data to
more deeply understand MBI engagement, and c) Develop expertise in designing, implementing, and sustaining
community-based research on mindfulness and adolescent health. The findings generated through this work will
provide preliminary insights into the role of engagement in MBI efficacy for adolescents, an important step toward
identifying pragmatic directions to optimize MBI for the prevention of adolescent mental health challenges. The
training and development activities will enable the candidate to launch her career as an independent scientist,
capable of effectively collaborating with communities to conduct research on MBI for the prevention of adolescent
health challenges and the promotion of holistic wellness."

 Cannabis use is becoming increasingly common in the US, and past-month use among pregnant women
increased by almost 60% from 2003 to 2019. Despite increasingly permissive legislation, our knowledge of the
behavioral and neurobiological consequences of prenatal exposure to cannabis and delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) lags behind. Hazardous cannabis use has been linked to psychosis onset and
psychotic-like experiences throughout the lifespan, and both cannabis use and psychosis have overlapping
neural foundations in reward circuitry. However, the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on youth
psychopathology are not yet known. Reward pathways implicated in cannabis use disorder and psychosis offer
key insights into how prenatal cannabis exposure may shape psychosis outcomes; functional brain alterations
during reward anticipation may represent a biomarker of disrupted reward processing. To enable the
development of early interventions and the discovery of robust biomarkers of psychosis risk, it is imperative to
determine relationships between neural and behavioral indices associated with hazardous cannabis use and
psychosis across development and inform predictive models. A unique opportunity to advance this work is
provided by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a 10-year national collaboration of 21
research sites designed to study the effects of substance use across development. The cohort includes 655
youth ages 9-13 who were exposed to cannabis prenatally and 10,834 who were not. Specially, the project aims
are to: 1) characterize longitudinal associations between prenatal cannabis exposure and psychotic-like
experiences (PLEs) across two years of follow-up; and 2a) Predict PLEs via machine learning classifiers built on
baseline psychosocial and environmental psychosis risk factors, including prenatal cannabis exposure, and 2b)
Predict PLEs via machine learning classifiers built on multivariate pattern analysis of neural activity in reward-
related brain regions during reward anticipation in a monetary incentive delay fMRI task. The results of the study
will have immediate public health and clinical implications providing clinicians, patients, and policymakers with
critical data on the impacts of prenatal cannabis exposure on youth mental health outcomes. Additionally, results
will aid in development of models for predicting psychosis risk during child development and inform future studies
on effects of in utero cannabis exposure. Completion of the training plan proposed here will provide essential
training in longitudinal modeling, neuroimaging approaches including task-based functional MRI (fMRI) and
machine learning techniques crucial to completing these aims. The Bearden and Cooper Labs and the
Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program at the University of California, Los Angeles will provide the ideal
training environments for the successful completion of this proposal."

While the proteasome is typically known as protein degradation machinery, it is now recognized to have
additional signaling functions in the nervous system. One poorly understood but therapeutically important role
for the proteasome is in pain regulation in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the relationship of
proteasome activity to pain sensation is complex and somewhat paradoxical: proteasome inhibition has been
found to either reduce pain or to cause pain sensitization and peripheral neuropathies depending on length of
inhibition, type of inhibitor, and inhibitor dose. A recent discovery that may grant insight into this regulatory
mechanism is our laboratory’s detection of a specialized, neuron-specific proteasome bound to the plasma
membrane (NMP: neuronal membrane proteasome) that rapidly modulates activity-dependent neuronal calcium
signaling through the release of extracellular signaling peptides. Preliminary data from our laboratory has
demonstrated that NMP inhibition reduces dorsal root ganglion nociceptor activity and mechanical pain
sensitivity, indicating that this novel neuronal communication pathway may be critical in proteasome/pain
signaling. However, many fundamental questions about the NMP remain, including how it differs from cytosolic
proteasomes and how variable NMP expression across neuronal sub-populations affects pain sensation. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that the PNS NMP plays an important role in pain signaling and that
characteristics of NMP expression in PNS sensory neurons, including subtype-specific activity patterns and
membrane localization patterns, directly affect its modulation of pain sensitization via differences in paracrine
signaling. To address this hypothesis, we propose a series of biochemical, molecular, physiological, and
behavioral assays addressing two specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the distribution and structure of the NMP
in PNS neuronal membranes; and Aim 2. To investigate the role of the PNS NMP in diverse neuronal subtypes
relevant to pain sensation. The completion of these aims will elucidate fundamental properties about the PNS
NMP and provide insight into its regulatory role in pain sensation, identifying possible therapeutic avenues for
pain modulation and laying the foundation for future investigations examining the role of the PNS NMP in health
and disease."

Host immune inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens, especially, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), is
engaged in the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues in periodontitis. Among several virulent factors produced
by Pg, a unique pathogenic lipid, phosphoglycerol dihydroceramide (PGDHC), promotes RANKL-induced OC-
genesis by acting on non-muscle myosin II-A (Myh9), while inhibiting the production of OB-genesis factor, IGF-
1, from OCs. In our preliminary results, wild-type Pg cells and purified PGDHC, but not serine palmitoyl
transferase (SPT) KO Pg cells (deficient in PGDHC production), abrogated mechanosensitive Piezo1-mediated
downregulation of OC-genesis. The data suggested that PGDHC may represent a unique virulence factor that
causes dysregulation of Piezo1-mechanosnsing system in osteoclasts which leads to retarded bone
regeneration. Based on these lines of evidence and preliminary results, it is hypothesized that
mechanosensitive Piezo1 elicits a cell signal in OCs that induces the production of IGF-1 and suppress OC-
genesis, while the PGDHC, by its binding to Myh9, blocks the mechanosensing function of Piezo1 and, hence,
diminishing the bone regenerative potential of alveolar bone affected by periodontitis. This hypothesis will be
tested by the following two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying PGDHC-
mediated inhibition of Piezo1 channel expressed on OCs in vitro. Aim 2) To determine the effect of PGDHC on
the Piezo1 expressed by OCs in a mouse model of ligature and Pg-induced periodontitis. Major four training
goals for the candidate include: 1) Gain and improve expertise in advanced science methods associated with
osteoimmunology and periodontology, 2) Improve skills in management and analyses of complex datasets, 3)
Acquire novel image acquisition and analysis techniques to link bacterial virulent factor and Piezo1 expressed
on osteoclasts, using Raman spectroscopy, in vivo imaging, micro-CT and biolayer interferometry, and 4)
Develop skills required to lead a research program, including grant writing, management of laboratory
personnel, project development and execution. Sponsor, Dr. Kawai, and co-sponsor, Dr. Han, who are
experienced in the proposed study addressing the periodontal osteoimmunology and immunopathology as well
as mentoring of postdoctoral fellows for their career development in the academic research fields, will be
committed to support the candidate’s training, along with consultation committees composed of 5 expert
researchers in the fields of lipidomics, bone biology, mechanosensory system, microbiology, and Raman
spectroscopy, respectively. All required equipment, devices, protocols and materials are available in the
laboratories of sponsors and consultants. The candidate is given a desk and laboratory space in Center for
Collaborative Research (CCR) which is the largest biomedical research building in South Florida, equipped
with a variety of cutting-edge equipment in the core facilities, all of which are available for the candidate’s

10913348,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) treatments, in which cancer patients are infused with autologous tumor-
specific cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells expanded and activated ex vivo, have become gradually more appealing for
cancer patients. Although ACT has shown great clinical success with melanoma, universal adoption has been
limited, as ACT relies on extremely complex cell-based methods with a significant price tag. Recently, increased
emphasis has been placed on enhancing acellular platforms, such as artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs),
that show promise in activating tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in a quicker, more tunable manner. While a majority
of aAPC systems have been applied in ex vivo settings, the development of biocompatible materials for aAPC
platforms have expanded the potential of these systems to be used in vivo, lessening the lengthy culture times
and costs associated with therapy. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a novel biomaterial aAPC for
direct, antigen-specific activation of CD8+ T cells in vivo for cancer immunotherapy. The particulate platform is
made from a novel blend of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and
Poly(beta amino ester) (PBAE), that promotes inclusion of the three signals required for optimal T cell activation
and expansion. We will investigate the effects of biomaterial properties and signal incorporation on in vitro T cell
activation, as well as gain insight into in vivo antigen-specific T cell activation in a tumor-burdened host.
We will develop immunologically compatible, particulate PLGA/PBAE aAPCs for in vivo injection and T
cell activation. First, we will investigate physicochemical properties of these aAPCs, including biomaterial
composition, size, and surface protein density. We will optimize these properties in the context of enhanced
CD8+ T cell activation and biological function. Second, we will focus on incorporating cytokines, additional signals
that are important in T cell activation, in a local and sustained manner. We will investigate various cytokines,
such as IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21, that may play a role in generating effector and memory T cells. Taken together,
we will identify leading tri-signal aAPCs that are optimized for both murine and human T cell activation in vitro.
Finally, we will apply our leading aAPCs in vivo, to analyze their CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, and anti-
tumor capacities. If successful, this proposal will generate a novel biomimetic approach for harnessing optimal
antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, with the potential of expanding patient access to cancer
immunotherapies and reducing health disparities."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common adult acute leukemia. Molecular features such as
cytogenetics and somatic mutations are essential components of risk stratification; used in daily clinical
practice to determine treatment modality and intensity. Our knowledge of recurrent genetic AML-associated
features, survival associations, subsequent genetic risk classification and clinical practice is informed by large-
scale genomic studies performed over the past decade on patients of Central-European ancestry. Thus,
current clinical practice is predicated on the supposition that adequate testing has been performed, and that
genetic background should not affect the known AML-associated genetic and genomic landscape and genes
that associate with treatment response and/or that drive AML-genesis. However, our published and preliminary
data reveal that ancestry affects not only the frequencies and impact of known AML-associated gene
mutations, but also multiple recurrent variants in genes thus-far not implicated in AML-genesis. We
hypothesize that: a) known AML-associated drivers may carry different prognostic significance and might need
to be adjusted in clinical risk classifications depending on ancestry, and b) some unrecognized molecular
features are ancestry-associated drivers of AML-genesis and/or therapy resistance. We propose to extend our
initial studies of AML genomes and genomics to provide statistical confidence around frequently mutated
genes, and a more inclusive molecularly-adjusted risk and treatment stratification for AML patients. Next, we
will focus on NPM1c, a genotype which confers favorable outcome in AML patients with Central-European
ancestry, but poor outcomes in other ancestries. We will use cutting-edge single-cell multiomic assays to
delineate bystander clonal mutations from potential driver mutations, then we will biologically test their role in
clonality/leukemia-stem-cell frequency and treatment response. We expect to provide an inclusive
characterization of the genetic and genomic landscape of AML, identify those variants with prognostic
significance, and provide exemplars of here-to-fore unrecognized drivers of treatment response and survival.
The overall goal is to enable precision oncology approaches which accommodate the effects of underlying
human genetics."

Lung and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are often diagnosed at very late stages of tumor progression when
they are most aggressive and difficult to treat. Currently, very little is known about the characteristics that make
up the complex tumor heterogeneity of late-stage tumors and what factors contribute to such changes in cancer
cell state and disease progression over time. Investigating how the mechanisms by which these contributing
factors impact tumorigenesis and tumor heterogeneity may uncover unappreciated biological processes that
control tumor development. The goal of this work is to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
drive changes in chromatin state and immune response and how they shape tumor heterogeneity and tumor
progression. In the F99 phase, I aim to elucidate how a novel tumor suppressor gene constrains lung
tumorigenesis. My colleagues and I identified STAG2 as a tumor suppressor in a genetically engineered mouse
model of oncogenic KRAS-driven lung cancer. STAG2 is a subunit of one of the two major cohesin complexes,
which are implicated in regulating chromatin boundaries and gene expression. However, the mechanism by
which Stag2 inactivation drives lung tumor growth is unknown. I performed chromatin accessibility profiling and
gene expression analyses on STAG2-proficient and STAG2-deficient mouse lung cancer cells and have unveiled
potential mediators of STAG2 function. Based on my analyses, I hypothesize that STAG2 controls genes
involved in early stages of tumorigenesis by directly impacting cohesin regulation of 3D chromatin organization.
Using chromatin conformation assays, I will assess how STAG2 regulates chromatin at different stages of tumor
progression and how Stag2 inactivation drives lung tumorigenesis. Additionally, I will use Tuba-seq to identify
key epistatic and downstream mediators of STAG2 tumor suppression and chromatin conformation assays to
ascertain the STAG2-mediated mechanisms impacting lung tumor maintenance. In the K00 phase, I aim to
elucidate how cancer cell state shapes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) response to T-cell mediated
anti-tumor immunity. PDAC subpopulations with distinct transcriptional profiles, stromal composition, and
response to chemotherapy have been previously established. However, it remains unknown whether these tumor
subtypes harbor differential response to T-cell mediated immunity. To investigate how cancer cell state shapes
PDAC progression by enabling evasion of cytotoxic T cell responses, I will leverage PDAC mouse models that
enable the initiation of cytotoxic T cell responses at different stages of tumor progression using an inducible
mouse model T cell antigen. Using longitudinal multi-omics, immunophenotyping, and tumor volume analyses, I
will investigate how aspects of tumor heterogeneity contribute to mechanisms of immune evasion at various
stages of tumor progression, identify key mechanistic drivers, and thus uncover novel strategies to enhance anti-
tumor immune responses. Together, this body of work will elucidate principles of chromatin regulation and tumor
heterogeneity that contribute to progression and immune response in lung and pancreas cancers."
10843238,"ABSTRACT
Unlike liquid cancers, current CAR T cell immunotherapies have little effect against solid cancers, largely due to
the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment. The race between administered CAR T cells and
tumor associated cells to kill off and/or neutralize the other is tipped heavily in favor of the tumor. Heterogeneous
tumors or tumors able to shed or downregulate CAR-targeted antigens can also escape elimination by functional
CAR T cell effectors. We recently found that CAR T cells delivery of dual cytokines can enlist and activate
endogenous T cells, NK cells and myeloid cells to mount an effective anti-tumor immune response. Further
investigation revealed that perforin and IFNγ are dispensable in CAR T cells, supporting an accessory role for
CAR T cells in mobilizing endogenous immune cells to ultimately control tumor growth. CAR T cell-mediated
dual cytokine delivery was effective in controlling tumor growth with 3 different CAR T cell constructs and 4 in
vivo tumor models: primary and metastatic melanoma and primary colon cell carcinoma mouse models, and
importantly was impervious to antigen loss. This suggests that the dual cytokine platform has potential for
universal application against multiple solid tumor types. In this application, we hypothesize that CAR T cell
delivery of dual cytokines has broad application because it counteracts immunosuppressive innate and adaptive
immune cells to elicit a broad endogenous anti-tumor response independent of CAR effector potential. We will
test this hypothesis by identifying CAR T cell survival and distribution dynamics (Aim 1), identify the common
and tumor-specific changes in immunosuppressive, immunostimulatory and effector leukocyte populations
isolated from poorly and strongly immunogenic tumors pre- and post-CAR cytokine treatment (Aim 2), and
determine their roles in activating endogenous tumor immunity (Aim 3). The cellular and mechanisms identified
will support further improvement and clinical translation of the Super2+IL-33 platform with various CAR targeting
constructs for CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors."

Because of its close phylogenetic relationship to the human, the non-human primate (NHP) brain holds
enormous potential for understanding structure, function, development and pathology of the human brain.
However, many obstacles impede studies of NHPs (among these, significant logistic, ethical, and financial
burdens). The Department of Neuroscience at Yale University houses a unique collection of brain tissue from
NHP macaques, ranging in age from embryonic to adult, which was generated over almost five decades in the
laboratories of Dr. Pasko Rakic and the late Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic. The collection includes sets of slides
with: (1) [3H]thymidine-labeled serially cut brains for cell birth dating; (2) brains labeled with tritiated amino
acids for tract tracing; (3) brains from monkeys with enucleations and selected cortical lesions; (4) brains from
prenatally X-irradiated and ultrasound-exposed monkeys sacrificed postnatally; (5) EM blocks from multiple
brain regions of fetal and postnatal monkeys; and, added in the last year, (6) histo- and immunohistochemically
processed brain tissue and (7) unprocessed NHP brain tissue blocks.
While MBR’s overreaching Specific Aims remain the same, proper adjustments have been made, conducive to
support ongoing research projects and to grow MBR in scope to accommodate new ones. This renewal
proposes: 1) To continue to inventory, catalogue, restore and add materials to MBR Collections 1 to 4. 2) To
histo- and immunohistochemically process tissue to expand collection 6 and to add unprocessed tissue blocks
to collection 7. 3) To continue to advertise and disseminate NHP brain information. 4) To continue to facilitate
use of the resource. A main purpose of the current renewal application is maintain MBR’s operations and to
facilitate its growth by funding the processing of tissue for different neuronal and non-neuronal markers (in M &
F specimens of 7 developmentally distinct age groups) to be added to collection 6. In addition, brain tissue
blocks viable for different treatments will continue to be added to collection 7. The grand objective of this grant
remains the same, to make these unique collections an international research resource that is readily available
to the neuroscience community at-large. If funded, MBR will continue to permit and foster NHP brain research
without requiring additional animal sacrifice. This avoids costly duplication of experiments and unnecessary
use of animals."

Neurons in the brain have limited energy reserves and thus rely on a “just-in-time” delivery strategy in which
active neurons signal to the brain microvasculature to increase regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), resupplying
nutrients and oxygen as well as removing toxic metabolites. Despite extensive study, the mechanisms
underlying the functional linkage between neuronal metabolic demand and vascular supply, termed
neurovascular coupling (NVC), remain poorly understood. Blood flow to the brain is mediated by parenchymal
arterioles and hundreds of miles of capillaries, which enormously extend the territory of perfusion. We recently
presented evidence supporting the concept that brain capillaries act as a neuronal activity-sensing network,
demonstrating that brain capillary endothelial cells (cECs) are capable of initiating an electrical
(hyperpolarizing) signal in response to neuronal activity that propagates upstream to cause dilation of feeding
arterioles and increase blood flow locally at the site of signal initiation. We have established the mechanistic
basis for this electrical signal, showing that neuron- and/or astrocyte-derived potassium (K+) is the critical
mediator and identifying the strong inward rectifier K+ channel, Kir2.1, as the key molecular player. We have
recently discovered that a second fundamental NVC mechanism based on calcium (Ca2+) signaling, with
distinct kinetics and regulatory features, also operates in brain capillaries, and can be initiated by the putative
NVC mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We have further found that a mechanism initiated by Gq-protein
coupled receptor signaling and mediated by dynamic changes in membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-
bisphosphate (PIP2) levels controls the balance between electrical and Ca signaling. Additional preliminary
2+
data support a role for gasotransmission via Ca2+-dependent endothelial nitric oxide signaling and pericyte-
mediated regulation of capillary blood flow in modulating NVC. The immediate goals of this proposal are to
create an integrated view of electrical, Ca2+ and related regulatory signaling mechanisms at molecular,
biophysical, and computational-modeling levels by examining their operation in increasingly complex segments
of the brain vasculature ex vivo, in vivo, and in silico. Ultimately, we propose to weave these research threads
together to create a systems-level view of physiological capillary-to-arteriole/pial artery signaling in the brain,
and test the concept that gradual degradation of this sensory web and the attendant progressive decay of
cerebrovascular function contributes to small vessel diseases of the brain."

Our research program seeks to elucidate the chemistry, biology and translational impact of “redox switches” in
the cardiovascular system. Our work has revealed that cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) operates as a
critical redox switch in the cardiovascular system by reducing substrates such heme and coenzyme Q to
modulate reactive nitrogen and oxygen species and downstream signaling. The overarching goal of this R35
research proposal is to fill four major gaps in our knowledge related to redox switches in the cardiovascular
biology. First, we will define the role(s) of the “other CYB5R” family members including CYB5R1, 2, 4, 5 and their
functions in endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes. While expressed in these cells types, there are no
reports defining the function(s) of these enzymes in the cardiovascular system. Using new cell type specific
knockouts of CYB5R1, 2, 4, 5, we will delineate the physiological and pathophysiological role(s) of these
enzymes across endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes and their potential function(s) in redox
signaling. Second, we aim to establish novel client proteins for the CYB5R family of enzymes using an innovative
“biopanning” approach. Utilizing a genetically modified soybean peroxidase coupled to CYB5R enzymes we will
establish new binding partners, substrates and mechanisms for these reductases. Third, using large human
data sets (i.e. n=8500 participants), we will assess if common genetic variants in CYB5R enzymes associates
with diseases such as hypertension, sickle cell disease and heart failure. Mechanistic studies will determine
functional impact of these variants on redox signaling pathways in cardiovascular cells. Forth, we will leverage
the information gained from our studies on CYB5R3 to test if a new drug we developed called “NitroQ” and test
if improves redox equilibrium and reverses hypertension, sickle cell disease and heart failure. Mechanistic
studies will elucidate key targets and downstream signaling pathways influenced by NitroQ. Collectively, these
fundamental basic, translational and therapeutic studies will provide a critical framework that will enable us to fill
these major gaps in our knowledge and improve our understanding of redox switches in cardiovascular health
and disease."
10755282,"Our research focus is estrogen receptor (ER)-positive luminal breast cancer, representing 75% of primary breast
cancer patients, who are prescribed adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) with hormonal agents. While recurrences
are delayed by the use of ET, resistance can evolve with the development of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in
about one-fourth of ER-positive patients. MBC patients acquire ESR1 mutations in a significant percentage of
cases. Our overall goal is to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities in ESR1m preclinical models that can
effectively block distant metastatic progression. Our proposal is highly translational. We hypothesize that
acquired ESR1m function as activated “oncogenes” inducing defective replication stress (RS) that suppresses
the DNA damage response (DDR), leading to a metastatic phenotype with actionable targets. Our innovation
includes a unique transplantable ER+ patient derived xenograft (PDX) frozen metastatic tumor bank to explore
the effects of selective cell cycle and DDR inhibitors. In Aim 1 we will study RS and DDR signaling in ex vivo
metastatic organoid cultures, focusing on ATR/Chk1, and PARP inhibitor effects on the DDR and its interactions
with ESR1m. In Aim 2, we will focus on cell cycle proteins AURKA/B and CDK1/2 to arrest the cell cycle in
ESR1m tumors. In Aim 3 we will evaluate mutant metastasis in vivo and the effects of novel therapeutics on
estrogen responses, EMT, and stem cell blockade. It is essential that the discovery of new therapeutic targets
and the preclinical testing of novel approaches be performed using metastatic models. Currently most preclinical
investigators only evaluate primary tumor proliferation, which may not reflect the ability of targeted inhibitors to
block the complex steps of metastasis. We predict that identifying the heterogeneity of driver mechanisms using
experimental modeling of ESR1 mutants will serve an important role in the development of therapeutic
combination interventions to overcome the clinical problem of resistance and rapid tumor progression. Our
project will fill a big gap in our clinical knowledge of how best to treat breast cancer patients who recur with
multiple and heterogeneous ER-positive metastases. With successful completion of our Aims we can impact
the effective ET maintenance of patients with ER-positive MBC and significantly delay time to progression."

Tuberculosis (TB) requires the simultaneous administration of multiple antibiotics to eradicate heterogeneous bacterial populations. Treatment duration ranges from 6 months for drug susceptible TB to 24 months and longer for extensively resistant TB. With a number of recent drug approvals and promising clinical development candidates, there is hope for much needed treatment shortening. However, we need high-throughput methods to rank the very large number of possible drug combinations and reduce them to a feasible number for testing in clinical trials. Currently, drug regimens are prioritized based on efficacy in the mouse model, which despite its ease of use, is available for only a small subset of all possible combinations. In addition, differentially drug-susceptible bacterial subpopulations that are found in human pulmonary lesions are not well recapitulated in murine lungs. A hallmark of TB is the formation of lesions and the coincident remarkable ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to persist in a variety of lesion types during drug treatment. These hard-to-treat bacterial subpopulations cause disease relapse. Therefore, key to prioritizing new regimens is systematic, high-quality in vitro measurement of multidrug regimen potencies and a framework that links in vitro measurements to efficacy in different types of human-like lesions. To do so requires that we develop in vitro models that capture key lesion-specific stressors and harness the potential of combination therapies to identify drugs that act synergistically. We propose to bridge this gap by developing a data-driven pipeline to rapidly prioritize drug regimens by combining in vitro and in vivo measurements of drug action with mathematical modeling. (1) We will utilize efficient measurement of drug combinations in a variety of growth conditions for direct comparison of combination drug effects in lesions. (2) We will leverage the human-like properties of pathology in non-human primates to query drug efficacy in distinct lesion compartments. (3) We will apply the power of multiscale (molecular, cellular, granuloma and organ scales) mathematical modeling to identify the stressors that are most predictive of in vivo efficacy. To build the pipeline, we will leverage a new drug regimen that has performed surprisingly well in clinical trials but the components of which antagonize in standard potency assays in vitro: the NiX-TB regimen comprising bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid. Once validated for NiX-TB versus standard of care, the pipeline will be used to rationally optimize and re-invent the NiX regimen using data-driven computational simulation."

Nearly one-third of the world population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent
of tuberculosis (TB). This reservoir contributes towards an increasing incidence of TB, with about 11 million
new cases and 1.8 million deaths every year. The profound success of Mtb in causing disease depends on its
ability to effectively utilize the host's lipid metabolism, including the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, to
subvert the immune system. The granuloma, the pathological hallmark of TB infection, is characterized by the
presence of lipid-loaded immune cells such as foamy macrophages that have a significantly reduced capability
in controlling bacterial growth. Although Mtb is known for modulating lipid metabolism, and in particular the
sphingolipid pathways during infection, there is no systematic understanding of how infective bacteria alter the
host lipidome. We recently found that sphingolipids, a distinct class of lipids with a sphingoid base backbone
that are enriched in cellular membranes, are essential for entry and killing of Mtb. We plan to extend our
investigation to define the role of each sphingolipid repertoire in Mtb pathogenesis. The main goal of the
proposed work is to systematically perturb the key sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways of the host to uncover
their function in Mtb pathogenesis and antimicrobial cellular processes such as the inflammasome. For this
purpose, individual knockout macrophage cell lines that lack key genes involved in the biosynthesis of
sphingolipids will be generated using CRISPR/Cas9-technology. We will use multifunctional sphingolipid
precursor analogs to define the flux, localization and the interactome of sphingolipids during infection in time-
and space-dependent manner. Furthermore, we will study the significance of sphingolipids in the
inflammasome, an innate immune process that is important in controlling Mtb infection. Understanding these
pathways or processes essential for the pathogenesis of Mtb is crucial, as they represent potential targets for
new therapeutics."

Mammalian cells contain a cytoplasmic multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) consisting of 8 aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (AARSs) and 3 non-synthetase proteins. AARSs in the MSC function as “gene decoders” during
mRNA translation, but also exhibit non-canonical functions outside the MSC. However, the assembly, structure,
and function of the MSC are poorly understood. Importantly, mutations in genes encoding 7/11 constituents
cause central nervous system (CNS) disorders – five cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD), and two
others cause progressive microcephaly. We will utilize state-of-the-art molecular approaches to improve our
understanding of the MSC, and its potential role in neuropathology. Our proposed Multiple-PI program takes
advantage of the expertise of two highly collaborative PI's – Paul Fox (Contact PI), a molecular biologist with
long-term interest in tRNA synthetases and the MSC, and Valentin Gogonea (Multiple PI), a physical chemist
with expertise in analysis and molecular modeling of multi-protein complexes. We will determine the quaternary
structure of the MSC by cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), a state-of-the-art method that facilitates
analysis of otherwise intractable complexes. To date we have found 19 inter-protein cross-links between all 11
MSC constituents, and 118 intra-protein cross-links. We have generated an initial model of the MSC that will
be refined here by XL-MS experiments with expanded amino acid specificity, and by SiMPull (single-molecule
pulldown) coupled with single-molecule fluorescence to determine stoichiometry. In addition, we will investigate
the mechanism of assembly of the MSC. Constitutive, multi-protein complexes are thought to be assembled by
domain-specific interactions between fully-formed, mature constituents (“post-translational assembly”).
However, assembly of some complexes utilizes a “co-translational assembly” mechanism in which a mature
constituent interacts with the nascent peptide of a partner constituent as it emerges from the ribosome. In
preliminary data we show at least 10 pairs of MSC constituents interact co-translationally. We will apply these
mechanistic approaches to elucidate the role of two MSC constituents in CNS diseases – genetic defects in
QARS1 and EPRS1 that cause microcephaly and HLD, respectively. Our preliminary studies indicate that
constituent mutation or suppression can lead to extra-MSC accumulation. Our preliminary studies have led us
to propose the following hypothesis: The mammalian MSC is a compact structure assembled in part by an
orderly sequence of co-translational interactions, however, mis-assembly or mutation can induce extra-MSC
accumulation of constituents, with potentially deleterious downstream consequences. We will test this
hypothesis by (1) determining MSC quaternary structure and component stoichiometry, and (2) determining the
role of co-translational interactions in MSC formation and integrity. We anticipate that elucidation of the
structure and assembly of the MSC will provide insights into mechanisms by which molecular defects in MSC
constituents can cause severe pathological disturbances, in particular, debilitating disorders of the CNS."
10747894,"Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim
prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable
treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20
years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM
patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets
requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial
heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and
temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the
tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP)
markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1
mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging
signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning
methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion
protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification
into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular,
we propose to carry out the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative
Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations
Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus
MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets.
Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures,
leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a
total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The
first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work.
Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit
(CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users"
10908632,"Project Summary: Overall 
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal death and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and disproportionately affects socially marginalized groups. We propose to create a Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence at Stanford University called PRIHSM (PReventing Inequities in Hemorrhage-related Severe Maternal morbidity). The goals of PRIHSM are to reduce PPH and associated SMM by reducing and addressing disparities in important precursors to PPH-related SMM and mortality: cesarean birth and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The problem of maternal IDA is vastly under-appreciated yet it affects approximately 16% of pregnancies in the U.S.; rates are 3-4x higher among Black people and 1.5-2x higher among Latinx people compared to the rest of the population. This translates to higher rates of PPH-related SMM. We propose that by effectively addressing antenatal IDA and these disparities, we can reduce PPH-related SMM. Additionally, almost 1 in 3 U.S. births are by cesarean delivery, rates vary 10-fold across hospitals, and Black and Asian individuals have the highest prevalence of cesarean section among low-risk pregnancies. While cesarean section can be a lifesaving intervention when appropriate, it is associated with significant risks that include PPH. We propose that enhanced birth equity and reduced variability in obstetric management are important strategies in addressing disparities in cesarean-linked PPH and reducing PPH-related SMM. Thus, our Aims are to: Aim 1 (Project 1). Reduce antenatal IDA by developing, implementing, and disseminating a patient-informed Anemia Prevention Toolkit, which will standardize the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of IDA and reduce the prevalence of IDA and racial/ethnic disparities in IDA at birth admission and PPH-associated SMM. Aim 2 (Project 2). Reduce disparities in rates of primary cesarean birth and cesarean-linked PPH by conducting a mixed methods study to understand drivers of hospital-level disparities in these outcomes, and implementing a patient-informed Maternal Equity Guide. Our work will involve community-university partnerships focused on improving maternal health equity and be driven by perspectives of patients, providers, and healthcare leadership. Our work will provide training opportunities to build research and clinical expertise relevant to PPH, especially among individuals who represent diverse perspectives and experiences within academic and community-based settings, and underserved areas. We propose a bold yet achievable agenda that will affect a sustainable decline in PPH-related mortality and morbidity and disparities."
10908642,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 1
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects up to one-third of people during pregnancy, with Black and Hispanic/Latina
people experiencing the highest rates. IDA is a condition of too little iron in the body, resulting in too few
healthy red blood cells, which puts pregnant people at risk for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH; excessive
bleeding after childbirth) and related severe maternal morbidity (SMM). IDA is preventable, but current
approaches to prevention and treatment are not working. The incidence of IDA during pregnancy is increasing,
the disparities are worsening, and patient perspectives are lacking. Rates of IDA at birth admission, the time of
greatest maternal risk, are up to 3-4x higher among Black pregnant people compared to White pregnant
people and 1.5-2x higher among Latinx pregnant people. The goal of this project is to increase hemoglobin
(i.e., resolve anemia) at birth admission for all pregnant people, thereby reducing the racial/ethnic disparities in
IDA and reducing anemia-related SMM from PPH. The objective of this project is to create a novel Anemia
Prevention Toolkit (i.e., a set of patient- and community-centered guidelines and implementation strategies)
and then implement and disseminate it at scale using collaborative quality improvement methods. The
rationale underlying this work is that both clinicians, represented by the Clinical Collaborative Leadership
Group, and community partners and people with lived experience of IDA, represented by the Anemia
Community Leadership Group, desire the education and guidance of such a toolkit and are dedicated to
working together to create, optimize, and implement it. We will achieve our goal by pursuing the following three
Specific Aims: 1) develop an Anemia Prevention Toolkit that aligns evidence-based practice with patient-
centered care, incorporating patients’ lived experience, community assets, and clinical/hospital workflows; 2)
optimize the Toolkit to increase hemoglobin at birth admission by piloting it at 8 hospitals, and examine its
acceptability and practicality; and 3) implement and disseminate the modified Toolkit across a network of more
than 300 hospitals in CA, OR, and WA to reduce anemia and SMM from PPH. To pursue these aims, we will
utilize a rigorous implementation science framework that combines patient-centered community perspectives
with structured, evidence-based clinical care and education for anemia in pregnancy. Guided by the Pathways
to Racial and Ethnic Disparities in SMM and Mortality Model, the project’s outcomes will prioritize patient and
community experiences and input. Clinical and health system stakeholders and frontline staff will work together
in alignment with the Public Health Critical Race Praxis, employing an iterative methodology to ensure
attentiveness to equity throughout the project. This innovative approach holds the research team accountable
to the patients and communities impacted by the significant problem of IDA during pregnancy—establishing
community partners as project co-leads, adopting methods that require ongoing check-in with the community,
and recognizing bias and structural racism as a factor that contributes to health disparities in IDA."

Almost 1 in 3 births in the United States involves cesarean delivery. A lifesaving intervention when appropriate,
cesarean is associated with significant risks that include severe postpartum hemorrhage and severe maternal
morbidity (SMM). Compared to vaginal delivery, women undergoing cesarean delivery incur the highest risk of
postpartum hemorrhage and hemorrhage-related morbidity. In the last 30 years, significant disparities in rates
of cesarean birth have developed for Black women, disparities that elevate their risks of morbidity from
hemorrhage and mortality. Reducing cesarean rates is therefore essential for reducing postpartum hemorrhage
and postpartum-related SMM. Eliminating disparities in cesarean delivery requires multifaceted, multilevel
interventions that can be deployed at scale. We will build on our expertise in achieving population-level
improvements in maternal outcomes (including hemorrhage and cesarean delivery) and long-standing
collaborative partnerships with patients, communities, and public health agencies to identify and implement
strategies to reduce disparities in cesarean birth and hemorrhage. Our state-wide quality improvement network
with a sophisticated real-time data center will enable us to support complex equity interventions and track
improvement. Capitalizing on our collaborative network of 218 hospitals covering 99% of births in CA, we will
realize the following Specific Aims: (1) Use mixed method approaches to identify strategies to reduce
disparities in rates of cesarean birth and cesarean-associated hemorrhages. (2) Center patient voices in the
validation and continuous curation of action tools and resources that will be integrated into a Maternal Equity
Guide, a toolkit of resources to drive equity change within hospitals. (3) Expand implementation of the Maternal
Equity Guide in state-wide efforts to reduce disparities. (4) Assess effectiveness of the Maternal Equity Guide
tools/resources and implementation strategies. We collect real-time patient-level data for all California births
including patient-identified race and ethnicity allowing us to measure changes in multiple maternal health
outcomes at state, hospital, and even provider levels. Combined with qualitative methods, this will provide a
particularly robust analysis of effectiveness of our interventions. Results will establish a national roadmap for
effectively integrating equity into large-scale quality improvement to address disparities in rates of cesarean
births with potential application to other aspects of obstetric care."
10908646,"Project Summary
The goal of the Community Engagement and Partnership component (CEP) is to ensure
that patients and key stakeholders are integrated into all phases of PRIHSM’s research to
promote maternal health equity. PRIHSM focuses on postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which is
one of the most common causes of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and maternal mortality.
PRIHSM prioritizes groups that bear the disproportionate burden of PPH, which includes Asian,
Black, Latinx and Native American individuals, those in mother-mother partnerships, and people
with limited resources and access to care. While engagement of patients and communities in
biomedical research is increasingly recognized as a best practice for promoting health equity,
there is a dearth of engagement in setting research priorities for SMM and limited understanding
of patients’ lived experiences after an obstetric complication. These limitations are even more
stark when considering issues such as severe PPH and its short and long term physical and
mental health outcomes, which are the focus of PRIHSM’s research projects. Strong,
bidirectional patient and community partnerships and effective engagement strategies are
essential for identifying and implementing the most promising interventions to reduce disparities
in SMM and maternal mortality due to PPH. Thus, CEP will create bidirectional partnerships with
patients, key stakeholders, and community-based organizations that represent people most
affected by the study outcomes through these Specific Aims: Aim 1. Build, strengthen, and
sustain bidirectional community-university partnerships focused on improving maternal health
equity; Aim 2. Integrate perspectives of patients, providers, and healthcare leadership into
PRIHSM’s research, using tailored, innovative engagement strategies such as data storytelling
and research prioritization activities to promote partner-driven solutions to improve patient-
centered outcomes. Aim 3. Develop and implement strategies to disseminate PRIHSM’s
findings to a broad audience and translate them into clinical policy and practice to promote
health equity, using innovative approaches such as mini-grants to community partners, digital
storytelling of study findings, and in-person community gatherings to facilitate maximum
engagement and uptake of key health information. Each of these aims is synergistically aligned
with our research projects and training objectives. Successful completion of these Aims will
result in strong, sustainable community-university partnerships dedicated to improving maternal
health equity and create a blueprint of best practices for successful community-engaged
research focused on maternal health."
10908649,"Project Summary – Training Component
The goals of the Training Component are to: (1) develop a training program that cultivates a community of
trainees focused on maternal health; (2) build content knowledge and expertise relevant to conducting multi-
disciplinary research in prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and related maternal
morbidities and mortality; and (3) equip clinicians with skills important for the treatment of PPH. These goals
will be accomplished by developing a diverse, multi-disciplinary team of trainees and mentors, implementing
specific activities tailored to meet the needs of trainees with a wide variety of experiences and interests, and
leveraging existing programs within Stanford. Postpartum hemorrhage is the thematic focus of PRIHSM and
will be a unifying thread throughout training activities, which will also extend to the additional focus areas of our
projects: severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and mortality, antepartum anemia, cesarean birth, and postpartum
mental health. We will work with trainees at varied stages of training (e.g., undergraduate to early-stage
investigator) and representing varied disciplines (e.g., clinical medicine, psychology, epidemiology,
implementation science, and community-engaged research), with specific emphasis on recruiting trainees that
qualify as under-represented minorities (URM) per NIH. Training and mentoring opportunities will also be
available to community partners to ensure bi-directional learning and community engagement. Our clinical
training program will focus on regions with limited maternal health care resources. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Build content knowledge necessary for conducting maternal health research, related to: a) the maternal
health crisis in the U.S.; b) foundations of community-engaged, equity-focused maternal health research; c)
research design and methods; d) logistics of the research process. Trainees will have access to didactics to
cover these topics, and a PRIHSM trainee discussion forum will enhance these learnings and build community.
Aim 2: Enhance and evaluate mentored research experiences conducting rigorous, actionable, equity-focused
maternal health research, by developing personalized plans and mentor teams tailored to the needs and
interests of individual trainees. Trainees will work on specific PRIHSM Research Projects and have
opportunities to work with community partners and other ongoing projects related to maternal health. Aim 3:
Train clinicians in under-resourced settings on best practices for prevention, treatment, and management of
PPH. We will work with Stanford’s GO MOMs program, which provides simulation-based training to optimize
team performance in obstetric emergencies. In sum, through this Training Component, we will increase the
pipeline and diversity of maternal health researchers, build competence in maternal health research and
clinical care, and enhance community partnerships that will all contribute to our stated goals and enhance
PRIHSM’s research projects. Together, accomplishment of these goals will lead toward a future of safety and
equity for all birthing people in the U.S."
10756104,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of my research program is to understand how transcription factors (TFs) direct the regulatory
programs that underlie cell fate decisions. My lab currently focuses on a fundamental step in TF regulatory
activity: how do newly induced TFs establish their DNA binding patterns? TFs should have binding affinity for
millions of sites along the typical vertebrate genome, yet only a small fraction appears to be bound in a given
cell type. Moreover, the cohort that are bound changes across cell types and developmental timepoints. We
have developed pioneering machine learning approaches for characterizing regulatory genomic events and
understanding TF binding specificity. We have collaboratively applied our computational approaches to
understand cell fate decisions in cell differentiation systems, finding new ways in which the binding of induced
TFs can be influenced by preexisting chromatin environments. This proposal aims to integrate algorithmic
development and applied analysis of regulatory systems to gain a comprehensive understanding of how
genome-wide TF binding patterns are predetermined by chromatin regulatory states.
 While many have cataloged the concurrent chromatin features that coexist with TF binding sites in a static
context, this proposal focuses on the dynamic settings that are typical of cell fate decisions. How does the
chromatin landscape in a given cell type shape where a newly induced TF will bind? Theme 1 will continue our
development of machine learning methods for studying dynamic TF binding activities. We will focus on novel
neural network architectures that can separate sequence and chromatin features to explain induced TF binding
patterns. Drawing on our unique expertise and methodologies, we will ask whether integrating 3D genome
organization or protein-DNA binding subtype modes (e.g., direct vs. indirect DNA binding) can explain why
certain sites become bound by induced TFs. We will further ask if DNA binding predeterminants are
transferrable: can we predict where a given TF will bind if introduced into a new cell type?
 Theme 2 will analyze how TFs interact with established chromatin environments during cell fate decisions.
We will ask how paralogous Forkhead box TFs recognize distinct binding targets, even when they have similar
DNA binding preferences and are expressed in the same chromatin environment. To understand how TF
binding sites and regulatory activities can change as cells proceed down differentiation trajectories, we will
continue long-standing collaborations that examine chromatin-dependent TF regulatory behaviors during
neuronal subtype specification and hematopoiesis. Complementary to these efforts, we will build integrative
regulatory models of temporal chromatin accessibility dynamics at the single cell level.
 The two themes will synergize to provide the computational tools and applied analyses that will enable a
more complete understanding of TF regulatory specificity during cell fate decisions."
10756106,"Project Summary: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet tea, sports and energy drinks,
fruit drinks) are the largest single food source of calories in the United States (US) diet and contributes
approximately 7% of total daily energy intake for US adults. Among Appalachian adults, SSB intake is
disproportionately high, averaging about 14% of total daily energy intake. There are strong and consistent data
documenting relationships among high SSB consumption and numerous health issues such obesity, diabetes,
some obesity-related cancers, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and dental decay. Further compounding
the SSB problem, the Appalachian region lacks access to providers, medical services, and evidence-based
behavioral prevention programs. There is also limited data on technology-based behavioral interventions in
Appalachia. However, given recent progress in shrinking the digital divide, the timing is optimal to evaluate
technology-based behavioral interventions in this region. The current proposal is designed to target this major
SSB dietary risk factor and public health challenge, as well as address notable gaps in the rural e/m-Health
literature. Importantly, this proposal builds on our team’s e/m-Health intervention expertise and decade of SSB
behavioral intervention research in rural Appalachia. iSIPsmarter is a technology-based behavioral and health
literacy intervention targeting SSB reduction and weight reduction/maintenance. It is comprised of six core
Internet-delivered modules, an integrated short message service (SMS) strategy to engage users in tracking
SSB behaviors, and a cellular enabled scale for in-home weight tracking. iSIPsmarter is a highly interactive,
structured, and self-guided program that uses strategies previously proven to promote behavior change.
iSIPsmarter also incorporates a stepped care approach to engage users who struggle to complete
components of the intervention. The proposed RCT is guided by the RE-AIM framework and targets 244 adults
from rural Appalachia. The overall goal is to examine the efficacy of iSIPsmarter in a 2 group [iSIPsmarter vs.
static Patient Education (PE) website] by 4 assessment (Pre, 3-, 6- and 18-month follow-up) design. It is
hypothesized that iSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at reducing SSB consumption than a PE website at
post assessment. Changes in secondary outcomes (e.g. overall dietary quality, weight, quality of life) and
maintenance of outcomes at 6- and 18-months post intervention will also be evaluated. Additional secondary
aims include to examine reach and representativeness, patterns of user engagement, and cost. Two tertiary
aims include exploratory mediation analyses and a systems-level, participatory process to understand context
for future organizational-level adoption of iSIPsmarter, and specifically to explore factors that would promote
or inhibit a sustainable SSB screening and referral process. The long-term goal of this line of this research is to
sustain an effective, scalable, and high reach behavioral intervention to improve SSB behaviors and weight
and to reduce SSB-related health inequities and chronic conditions in rural Appalachia and beyond."
10756110,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Actin-based protrusions endow cells with a vast variety of forms. Cells on the surface of mucosal epithelial
tissues, such as the cornea and mouth, often project elongated, wrinkle-like protrusions called microridges,
which are arranged on apical surfaces in maze-like patterns. Microridges help these cells retain mucus, thus
protecting vulnerable epithelial tissues from infection, abrasion and drying out. Until recently, almost nothing
was known about microridge morphogenesis. Since microridge morphologies are distinct from those of better-
studied protrusions, studying them could reveal fundamental new principles of protrusion morphogenesis.
In recent years, the Sagasti lab established larval zebrafish skin cells as a model for studying microridge
morphogenesis. This model enables powerful molecular manipulations and live imaging of morphogenesis.
The Sagasti lab’s initial studies revealed several new discoveries, including: 1) The dissection of microridge
morphogenesis into four molecularly separable steps, 2) the discovery that myosin contraction in the apical
cortex regulates surface tension to permit microridge formation, 3) the identification of Plakin cytolinkers as
master regulators of microridge length, 4) the discovery that keratin filaments are integral components of
microridges required for their stability and elongation (the first example of intermediate filaments directly
contributing to protrusion morphogenesis), and 5) the discovery that cortical myosin minifilaments orchestrate
an unusual microridge fission/fusion rearrangement process that facilitates the formation of regular, periodic
microridge arrangements on cell surfaces. Collectively, these discoveries have broad implications for how
cortical myosin, cytolinkers, and intermediate filaments contribute to protrusion morphogenesis.
Building on these achievements and new preliminary data, the Sagasti lab will pursue two future lines of
research. First, since cortical contractility creates the biomechanical conditions enabling microridge
morphogenesis, they will investigate how cross-linking proteins and cell junctions temporally and spatially tune
cortical contractility to promote microridge formation and patterning. Since cortical contractility controls many
cellular processes, these experiments will reveal regulatory mechanisms with wide relevance in cell biology.
Second, since Plakin cytolinkers are central regulators of microridge initiation and elongation, they will
investigate how the structure of Plakins relate to their functional roles in microridge morphogenesis, and use
Plakin proteins as handles for identifying new regulatory components of the cytoskeletal scaffold that creates
microridge protrusions."
10890873,"Child victimization and injury continue to be major public health challenges, jeopardizing the healthy development of
millions of American children every day. Post-pandemic, elementary schools are reporting significant delays in children’s
social and emotional development, as well as higher rates of harmful internal and externalizing behaviors. Child
victimization by peers is linked to psychosis by late childhood and adolescence, harming school outcomes due to higher
absenteeism, reduced classroom attentiveness, increased school drop-out, and greater risk for teen substance abuse,
delinquency, and violent behavior.
 Demand for an effective bullying, sexual abuse, child abduction/trafficking, and violence prevention program has
grown over the past two decades, with many states mandating school-based programs to help reverse violent and other
adverse behaviors among children in schools. Currently, only 25% of school-based prevention programs have been shown
to be somewhat effective in reducing peer victimization. Also, most successful bullying prevention programs do not align
with nationally recommended safety guidelines deemed essential for effectively protecting children from victimization
and violence. The radKIDS® Personal Empowerment and Safety Education Program is a school-based program developed
in response to these national recommendations. radKIDS® uses activity-based skill training to help elementary aged
children develop personal safety boundaries, critical thinking skills for responding to threats of danger, age-appropriate
coping strategies for dealing with current and past victimization, self-assertiveness and physical skills for self-defense,
communication skills for reporting incidences to parents/adults, and increasing child self-worth—the program’s
cornerstone for personal safety and healthy development for elementary students.
 Within Phase I, we showed that online training, with enhanced student curriculum, met all benchmarks in instructor
self-efficacy, knowledge gains, and program usability, acceptability, user satisfaction, consumer satisfaction, and fidelity
of implementation. Within Phase II, our goals are to: 1) Complete full adaptation of radKIDS® instructor training and
student instruction into a blended online/in-person instructor training and instructional delivery system that can be used
for broad-scale dissemination among low income, rural and minority serving elementary schools, and 2) Conduct a
clustered randomized trial with 40 elementary school, with one 4th grade classrooms per school, in the states of California,
Oregon, Utah and Texas. We will assess a) student growth in knowledge, safety skill self-efficacy, confidence in help-
seeking and in maintaining personal safety, and child self-esteem, and b) levels of instructor knowledge of student
personal safety domains, usability of program, acceptability of program, consumer satisfaction, and fidelity of
implementation. Exit interviews will be conducted with school administrators to assess program satisfaction and strategies
for adoption and full implementation in schools. If the modified program is effective and practical for use in schools,
wide-spread implementation as a result of effective marketing could have a large impact on public health by decreasing
incidents and risks of victimization and reducing child trauma due to preventable violence, abuse, and injury."

Bathrooms are extremely hazardous for older adults and wheelchair users. Bathroom injuries, many related to
toileting, occur at a rate of 266.6 per100,000 among persons aged ≥85 years and result in costly, injurious falls
and numerous cascading adverse health consequences. Transfer assisting technologies are important tools that
can be used to promote wellness, independence, community participation, and quality of life. New, easy-to-use
technologies that enable more efficient and safer toilet transfers for patients and caregivers are desperately
needed. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to refine and evaluate PPAL®, an assisted toileting device that
enables persons at risk for toileting-related falls to safely transfer with less physical assistance from a caregiver.
The proposed Phase II activities will refine and test theproof-of-concept prototype developed under an NIH
Phase I project by QUA, Inc. PPAL is a patented, motorized, height adjustable bedside commode with integrated
transfer boards. PPAL incorporates a transfer board that moves up and down as the Chair seat is raised or
lowered so that the user can always perform a downhill transfer. This innovation will allow individuals with limited
mobility who currently rely on caregiver assistance to transfer more independently. It will also decrease the risk
of falls and injuries for users and caregivers. Phase I results show that to improve manufacturability and
commercial potential, the initial prototype should offer more appropriate height levels for wheelchair users
(WCUs), added seating and positioning features, and a more maneuverable, sleeker base that can be kept at
bedside. The proposed Phase II study is organized around three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a pre-production
prototype that enables level and downhill transfers between a wheelchair or bed and the PPAL, is suitable for
institutional and home use, and is designed for manufacturability. This will be accomplished by conducting design
reviews with stakeholders, designing for manufacturability, conducting engineering testing in accordance with
standards, performing in lab evaluations with stakeholders, and revising the prototypes based on feedback
received. In Aim 2, we will assess the usability and utility of PPAL in real-world home settings and short-term
impact on fall/near fall incidence, level of toileting assistance, fear of falling and caregiver burden. The PPAL will
be placed in residences of WCUs and their formal or informal caregivers. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline
and at the conclusion of a 6-week device trial. Aim 3 will develop and validate clinical guidelines for PPAL use.
An interdisciplinary stakeholder group of expert clinicians and Safe Patient Handling and Movement (SPHM)
professionals will be convened to assist with identifying clinical parameters for the safe prescription of the PPAL.
The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a toileting solution that will increase user independence
and decrease both user and caregiver injury. The PPAL will be suitable for deployment in homes, skilled nursing
and rehabilitation facilities as well as hospitals."

bedside. The proposed Phase II study is organized around three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a pre-production
prototype that enables level and downhill transfers between a wheelchair or bed and the PPAL, is suitable for
institutional and home use, and is designed for manufacturability. This will be accomplished by conducting design
reviews with stakeholders, designing for manufacturability, conducting engineering testing in accordance with
standards, performing in lab evaluations with stakeholders, and revising the prototypes based on feedback
received. In Aim 2, we will assess the usability and utility of PPAL in real-world home settings and short-term
impact on fall/near fall incidence, level of toileting assistance, fear of falling and caregiver burden. The PPAL will
be placed in residences of WCUs and their formal or informal caregivers. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline
and at the conclusion of a 6-week device trial. Aim 3 will develop and validate clinical guidelines for PPAL use.
An interdisciplinary stakeholder group of expert clinicians and Safe Patient Handling and Movement (SPHM)
professionals will be convened to assist with identifying clinical parameters for the safe prescription of the PPAL.
The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a toileting solution that will increase user independence
and decrease both user and caregiver injury. The PPAL will be suitable for deployment in homes, skilled nursing
and rehabilitation facilities as well as hospitals."

Avian influenza A H7N9 causes severe respiratory illness with a high mortality rate, and its zoonotic capacity
has raised serious concerns over the possibility of a pandemic. The value of vaccines for pandemic-potential
viruses has been demonstrated by the devastating effects of COVID-19 on human health and the economy.
Development of H7 Influenza vaccines has lagged, as pandemic influenza vaccines have generally been
developed with traditional technologies, and low immunogenicity for H7 products in humans has been reported.
The high threat presented by this strain represents a substantial market gap for newer technologies to fill. The
COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the potential of RNA vaccines as a rapid-response platform, but also
demonstrated their limitations. Current generation vaccines relying on lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery are
known to elicit unwanted acute inflammatory responses and require ultra-low temperatures for long-term
storage and stable refrigeration at the point-of-care, highlighting the need for new delivery approaches. In
Phase I studies, Tiba Biotech established Proof-of-Principle that an intramuscular immunization of BALB/cJ
mice with a novel, less inflammatory formulation containing a proprietary delivery molecule and highly
immunogenic RNA replicons encoding the H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA) and Nucleoprotein
(NP) at a 1:1:1 mass ratio induced immune responses against all antigens. This approach is expected to
increase the immunogenicity and heterotypic protective potential of the vaccine, and the RNABL platform that
is utilized maximizes the safely delivered RNA mass content, protects RNA from degradation, and enables
efficient uptake by cells in vivo. In Phase II, Tiba Biotech plans to further develop the prototype H7N9 vaccine
by evaluating different ratios of RNAs and delivery materials from Tiba’s enhanced RNABL library, developing
manufacturing, scale up and quality control processes for the RNA components of the vaccine, determining
optimal dosing in a mouse model, establishing protective efficacy in a highly relevant ferret challenge model,
and performing preliminary safety assessments and biodistribution studies in rats. These studies will enable a
request for a pre-IND meeting, and this meeting will be used to inform further experiments prior to IND filing
and clinical trials. Ultimately, this vaccine product will have the potential for commercialization and use in
vaccine stockpiling, enabling preparedness in the case of a H7N9 influenza pandemic. In addition, the
prototype composition developed here will serve as a platform into which any outbreak antigen sequences
could be rapidly implemented."
10923931,"Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the strongest known risk factor for, and obligate precursor of, esophageal high-
grade dysplasia (HGD) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, determining future neoplastic progression risk
is quite challenging in BE patients: current risk estimation is based solely on highly variable, subjective,
observer-dependent histopathologic diagnoses (i.e., non-dysplastic (ND), Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD),
Indeterminate for Dysplasia (IFD), or High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD). Our ENVISAGE assay is a validated
(CLIA # 21D2256153) laboratory-developed test (LDT) based on a 4-gene-plus-patient age DNA
methylation-based PCR assay that was developed at Capsulomics built on foundational studies performed
at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Our preliminary studies yielded a ready-to-launch 1st-generation assay
that accurately predicts the risk of future neoplastic progression in BE patients based on levels of molecular
biomarkers. This prognostic assay risk-stratifies patients to vastly improve clinical decision-making, with a
sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 90%, outperforming any other clinically available tests.
Notwithstanding this early success, we have identified a need for further improvement as well as a robust
commercialization pathway. With funding of this direct-to-phase II proposal, we will make significant
improvements to generate a more sensitive, more robustly validated second-generation product, while
building a foundation for strategic commercialization and market adoption of both the current and future
assays. Aim 1 will address assay sensitivity challenges due to using limited-quantity, low-quality fragmented
DNA from biopsy specimens by engineering a new assay based on multiplex PCR. This advancement will
also improve throughput, efficiency, cost, and processing speed. Aims 2 and 3 will augment our study
population while incorporating the new multiplex protocol from Aim 1, retain and refine our algorithm to
produce a 2nd-generation ENVISAGE assay, and more sharply delineate which patients will fall into the
“Intermediate” risk category for improved clinical management. Aim 4 will establish early commercialization
of the 1st-generation assay as an LDT while developing a platform for the future launch of our 2nd-generation
product. Thus, this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal will expand, refine, and validate the ENVISAGE assay,
a novel LDT for stratifying future neoplastic progression risk in BE patients, thereby improving clinical
decision-making."
10932227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will improve the care of patients suffering from Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS). Catheter-based
thrombectomy has been established as the standard treatment for AIS. Still, substantial limitations remain: <50%
of patients achieve first-pass clot clearance, the best predictor of good neurological outcome, largely due to
shortcomings in the approach (transfemoral access [TFA]) and the current catheters used to aspirate clots.
Given the advanced age of many or most thrombectomy candidates, highly tortuous vessels are frequently
encountered when traversing from the femoral to carotid territories. It has been shown that substantial
tortuosity leads to worse outcomes in TFA procedures. Thus, many leading interventionalists have proposed
transradial access (TRA) in place of transfemoral access. TRA is already the preferred access site for the vast
majority of interventional cardiology procedures, given low rates of bleeding complications and ready access to
the coronary circulation. The radial site also provides ready access to the cerebral vasculature, bypassing
tortuosity along the aortic arch, descending aorta, and ilio-femoral system. However, neurointerventionalists
who use TRA are stuck employing femoral guide sheaths (such as the Ballast or Neuron Max), which are not
designed for the radial-to-intracranial navigation and which have safety concerns due to the vasospasm or
radial artery occlusion that can result from their imperfect adaptation to TRA.
A parallel advancement in neurointervention is that of SuperBore Distal Access Catheters (DACs) used to
efficiently pull out clots from arteries of patients suffering from AIS. These SuperBore DACs provide large
lumens (increasing suction by >30% over conventional DACs), but struggle with navigation challenges in
tortuous anatomies, with nearly half of procedures resulting in failure to navigate to the clot face. While they
provide a major advance in DAC sizing, SuperBores have not been considered for TRA approaches due to
their thick walls and stiff tips, precluding the ability to achieve optimized navigation or suction power from the
radial approach. Our team discovered this pressing need after achieving acquisition by Medtronic of our
previous SBIR-funded program via intensive interviews of 50+ physicians.
In our successful Phase I project, we developed and tested our novel SuperBore thrombectomy system
appropriate for TRA. Specifically, our “Wrist-to-Brain” thrombectomy system provides the distinct advantages
of: (1) combining guide catheter and SuperBore DAC in a single catheter, (2) hyperthin walls enabled by our
novel, proprietary liner, and (3) a highly trackable and kink resistant shaft that still fits within the radial artery in
most patients. In this Phase II SBIR program, we propose a full, formal validation program guided by FDA
testing criteria (Aim 1), followed by extensive benchtop, GLP animal, and cadaveric testing (Aim 2). This grant
will enable us to complete all testing needed to submit for FDA clearance and begin marketing our novel and
impactful Wrist-to-Brain thrombectomy system in order to improve the care of patients suffering from LVO AIS."
10922782,"In 2022 WHO called for highly efficacious vaccines against malaria that prevent Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf) infection in > 90% of recipients. Alone among malaria vaccines, Sanaria® PfSPZ (Pf
sporozoite (SPZ)) vaccines have shown > 90% vaccine efficacy (VE) against controlled human
malaria infection and VE against intense field transmission of malaria to pregnant women for two
transmission years without boosting. Our goals are to further increase potency, increase efficiency
and consistency of manufacture and reduce cost of goods (COGS) to be able to use a PfSPZ vaccine
for elimination of malaria. PfSPZ vaccines are manufactured using stage V Pf gametocytes fed to
mosquitoes, a process that includes tight coordination between culture of gametocytes and mosquito
rearing. Most importantly, Sanaria has developed methods for producing PfSPZ without mosquitoes
in bioreactors (Nature, 2022). Transitioning to bioreactor production would increase efficiency of
manufacture by at least 10-fold, reduce COGS by >90%, and allow for PfSPZ vaccine production
worldwide. This proposal is intended to provide mass-produced, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved
ookinetes that can be used to increase efficiency of production of mosquito- and bioreactor-produced
PfSPZ vaccines. We will optimize production, purification, cryopreservation, QC release, and use in
manufacturing of ookinetes. The early steps in manufacturing that end with ookinetes can then be de-
linked from the later steps that commence with ookinetes, allowing both to proceed separately,
unconstrained by timing or physical location. The work will be addressed in 4 Specific Aims. 1:
Optimize ookinete production. Media and culture conditions for stage V gametocytes will be optimized
for conversion to ookinetes. Readouts will include female:male ratio, macrogametocyte density, and
stage specific antigen expression. Our target is a method that consistently results in 25% conversion
of stage V gametocytes to ookinetes. 2: Develop and optimize methods for ookinete purification. We
will test multiple methods, selecting those that can be scaled. Our target is Pf ookinetes that are
100% free of RBCs with a yield of 80% using a method that can be adapted to large scale
manufacturing. 3: Develop a protocol for ookinete cryopreservation. Sanaria routinely cryopreserves
PfSPZ with consistent, excellent results. Ookinetes are similar to PfSPZ. Both are motile, have a
multimembrane pellicular complex, express a dominant membrane protein, and are similar in size. A
range of cryoprotectant additives (CPA), cooling and warming rates, and CPA dilution methods will be
tested. Our target is a survival rate of at least 50%. 4: Develop assays for ookinete viability and
potency. 4 approaches will be tested: a) Membrane integrity, b) Motility, c) Infectivity to mosquitoes to
produce PfSPZ, and d) In vitro conversion of ookinetes to 3- and 8-day oocysts and iPfSPZ."
10758204,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) are two of the most prevalent
psychiatric conditions and are highly comorbid. The social and financial burden that results from a lack of
effective treatments for these disorders is enormous. Therefore, there is a clear and urgent need to gain a greater
understanding of the pathophysiological basis of PTSD and AUD comorbidity. Current evidence suggests the
neurocircuitry of PTSD and AUD significantly overlap, which includes dysfunctional control of behavior by the
prefrontal cortex (PFC). Thus, alterations in prefrontal mediated cognitive processes that regulate behavior may
contribute to the high comorbidity of the disorders. There is a strong correlation between the age of onset of
alcohol use during adolescence and the likelihood of developing an AUD later in life. In addition, adolescence is
a critical period of continued development, and accumulating evidence indicates that the abuse of alcohol during
adolescence can have long-term consequences on brain and behavior. Considering the high prevalence of
adolescent alcohol abuse, it is therefore surprising that little research has focused on understanding its impact
on an individual’s ability to cope with a traumatic stress event in adulthood. The overarching hypothesis of this
proposal is that adults with a history of adolescent alcohol abuse who experience a traumatic stress event have
reduced stress resiliency and are at a significantly higher risk of developing PTSD and AUD. This experimental
approach takes advantage of a binge ethanol model consisting of repeated cycles of Adolescent Intermittent
Ethanol (AIE) exposure by vapor inhalation and a Single Prolonged Stress (SPS) procedure that is thought to
model a traumatic stress event in humans. Following AIE and SPS exposure in early adulthood, rats will then be
tested for alterations in fear behavior and ethanol self-administration. The following three specific aims are
designed to test the overarching hypothesis: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that exposure to AIE-SPS results in
pharmacologically reversible alterations in fear-related behaviors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that exposure to
AIE-SPS increases alcohol consumption and relapse-like behavior induced by exposure to fear conditioned
cues. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that AIE-SPS induced alterations of fear behaviors reflect alterations in
prelimbic and infralimbic communication with core regions of the fear neurocircuitry. Findings from these novel
and innovative studies will significantly advance our understanding of the behavioral deficits and neural
mechanisms underlying the complex interactions between AUD and PTSD, and whether a history of adolescent
alcohol abuse may represent a pre-existing risk factor that increases susceptibility of developing not only PTSD
associated with a traumatic event but also AUD."

Azoles are antifungal agents widely-used in clinical applications and agriculture. Despite evident exposures in
humans, the developmental health risks associated with azole exposures during pregnancy remains undefined.
In vertebrate models, azoles cause developmental toxicity, including a spectrum of congenital malformations.
While the mechanisms are unresolved, azoles induce changes in the embryo that resemble excess
bioavailability of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) due to similarities in adverse morphological and molecular
phenotypes. In a spatiotemporal-dependent manner, RA regulates the transcription of hundreds of genes,
several with known essential functions for embryonic development. Many environmental chemicals are
suspected to cause developmental toxicity by disrupting RA signaling at different points in the pathway. As we
transition towards alternative, animal-free approaches for developmental toxicity testing, delineating
toxicological mechanisms associated with perturbations in key signaling pathways such as RA is warranted to
establish appropriate in vitro and in silico testing models for identifying chemical hazards. In this project, we
propose to leverage alternative models for developmental toxicity testing: rat whole embryo culture (WEC; Aim
1), zebrafish (Zf; Aim 2) embryo, and human embryonic stem cell (hESC; Aim 3) models and innovative
molecular tools (e.g., single-cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9), to investigate mechanisms linked with
azole-induced developmental toxicity during a predefined susceptible window in embryogenesis (early
organogenesis). We will determine conserved molecular, cellular, and morphological changes due to azole
exposure and functional targets with roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and patterning. Results will be
used to delineate an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) of azole-induced developmental toxicity. Finally, our
study will be one of the first investigations to implement single-cell transcriptomics and multi-gene editing to
link chemical exposures to adverse developmental outcomes on molecular, cellular and organism levels."

Inflammation is a necessary biological response to injury, infection, and environmental exposures, and a well-
orchestrated physiological process, which if unchecked produces undesirable toxicity. Unresolved inflammation
contributes to the development of chronic diseases exacerbated by environmental exposures. The molecular
mechanisms and players of resolution of inflammation are not well understood. In this application, we will
examine two novel pathways that we hypothesize to play a critical role in the resolution of inflammation. 1. We
previously reported that diesel exhaust particle extracts and associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inhibit
COX2-dependent eicosanoid synthesis in murine macrophages. While COX2 is commonly thought to be pro-
inflammatory, Cox2 macrophage-specific knock-out (Cox2MKO) mice develop intestinal inflammation when fed
a high fat diet. Macrophage COX2 thus appears to provide an inhibitory molecular check on chronic inflammation
mediated by dietary and environmental exposures. In preliminary experiments, we show that loss of COX2
impaired efferocytosis in mouse primary macrophages and COX2 modulated the production of efferocytosis-
dependent lipid inflammatory mediators that not only affect secondary efferocytosis but also induce a tissue
repair phenotype in intestinal epithelial organoids. Under specific aim 1, based on published and recent
preliminary results, we will test the hypothesis that macrophage COX2-dependent eicosanoids play a critical role
in chronic inflammatory diseases exacerbated by environmental pollutants. 2. Our laboratory pioneered the
development of amphipathic peptides that mimic the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of
apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I mimetic peptides (4F) inhibit the development of inflammatory diseases that
are exacerbated by dietary and environmental exposures including atherosclerosis and intestinal inflammation.
We demonstrated that 4F attenuates ambient ultrafine particle (UFP)-mediated oxidative stress, lipid metabolism,
atherosclerosis and intestinal inflammation. A common mechanism of protective action of 4F in all these disease
models is by tilting the net balance of lipid mediators of inflammation to an anti-inflammatory state, in the
circulation and tissues. In preliminary results, we demonstrated that apoA-I mimetic peptides enhance
transintestinal lipid transport (TILT) ex vivo and in vivo. Under specific aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that
TILT is a key mediator of resolution of inflammation and plays an important role in the development of chronic
inflammatory diseases exacerbated by environmental exposures. Successful completion of the studies proposed
in this new R01 application will not only advance our understanding of the biology and molecular mechanisms
underlying the effects of environmental exposures on the resolution of inflammation but also provide novel
therapeutic strategies in our fight against chronic inflammatory diseases exacerbated by air pollution."
10763377,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A key question in neurobiology is how individual neurons precisely connect with each
other to form functional circuits during development. Understanding the mechanisms of
neural circuit assembly in the mammalian brain may provide insights into the etiology of
human brain disorders. In the mammalian brain, each neuron on average forms
connection with thousands of other neurons. The assembly of these complex circuits
depends on cell-cell communication during many steps of neural development.
In the previous three cycles of this grant, we have developed methods such as MADM
(Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers) and viral-genetic manipulations in mice that
allowed us to label and genetically manipulate specific neuron cell types, down to
individual neurons, and study genes that play key roles in dendrite morphogenesis and
target selection of axons. Specifically, we have recently identified two cell-surface
proteins, Teneurin-3 (Ten3) and Latrophilin-2 (Lphn2), that are expressed in
complementary patterns in the interconnected nodes of hippocampal network, following
a “Ten3→Ten3, Lphn2→Lphn2” connectivity rule . We have shown that Lphn2 acts as a
heterophilic repulsive ligand and Ten3 acts as a homophilic attractive ligand to direct
Ten3+ proximal CA1 axons to selectively target to distal subiculum; at the same time,
Ten3 acts as a repulsive ligand to direct Lphn2+ axons to proximal subiculum. We have
also developed a method that allows us to profile cell-surface proteomes with exquisite
sensitivity and spatiotemporal control.
In this proposal, we will expand on both of these recent advances. Specifically, we will
investigate whether Ten3 and Lphn2 instruct wiring specificity in multiple nodes of the
extended hippocampal network and in other brain regions, how Ten3-Lphn2 interaction
leads to axon repulsion, and whether G protein signaling is essential for Lphn2’s action
as a receptor or a ligand. Complementary to the in-depth studies of Ten3 and Lphn2, we
will use our cell-surface proteomic profiling methods to broadly survey changes of cell-
surface proteomes from developing to mature neurons, and to identify new cell-surface
proteins that regulate dendrite morphogenesis and neural circuit assembly."

 Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, reducing everyday mobility and communication skills in
more than half of survivors. Acute rehabilitation through early interventions is a mainstay for recovery and
improving physical function in stroke patients. Unfortunately, patients recovering from acute stroke are at risk for
poor, non-restorative sleep, when sleep is critical for recovery and participation in intense physical rehabilitation.
During acute rehabilitation, stroke patients face two sleep-related challenges: (1) uncoordinated and often
unnecessary nocturnal interruptions (vitals, medications, etc.) due to medical or nursing care; and (2) a high risk
of undiagnosed sleep disordered breathing.
 Given the critical role of sleep in enhancing neural recovery, motor learning, neuroprotection, and
neuroplasticity, interventions to enhance sleep that target these two areas could improve recovery and
rehabilitation outcomes for stroke patients. In this proposal, a multidisciplinary group of researchers with
expertise in rehabilitation medicine, sleep medicine, nursing, physical therapy, wearable technologies, and
implementation science will adapt, implement and evaluate a state-of-the-art intervention to promote sleep for
stroke patients undergoing acute rehabilitation. SIESTA-Rehab, adapted from our previous unit-based
intervention, bundles two sleep-promoting interventions to address the unique sleep challenges stroke patients
face during acute rehabilitation: (1) nursing education and empowerment to reduce unnecessary disruptions; (2)
a systematic protocol to screen, diagnose, and treat sleep-disordered breathing if present during acute stroke
rehabilitation. This work will take place at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab (SRALab), the first-ever translational
research hospital that brings clinicians and researchers together to make breakthrough discoveries in
rehabilitation. Researchers at their Center for Bionic Medicine have pioneered the development and validation
of a high-resolution wearable sensor platform to monitor stroke recovery via continuous biometric and
movement-based sensor data for clinical symptoms (e.g., movement, sleep, heart rate variability, speech &
swallowing, and gait quality). These sensors have been tested during performance of validated clinical tests and
inpatient activities (e.g., therapy, down-time, sleeping).
 We aim to study the effectiveness of SIESTA-Rehab on improving sleep and rehabilitation outcomes during
acute rehabilitation for stroke and after discharge home. Because there are two stroke floors at SRALab and
patients are admitted in a quasi-random allocation, we can implement SIESTA-Rehab in one unit while the other
unit receives Usual Care (routine night nursing care and clinician judgment to order sleep study). This natural
experiment enables a difference-in-differences approach, controlling for relevant covariates, to compare short
and long-term sleep and rehabilitation outcomes between patients in the SIESTA-Rehab and Usual Care units."

Chronic pain during childhood and adolescence is a significant personal and societal burden, affecting 20–25%
of youth. Unfortunately, treatment is difficult and long-term outcomes are poor, in part due to the limited
understanding of how chronic pain manifests across the first two decades of life. Chronic widespread pain is
common in adults, and often occurs in absence or not in proportion to tissue damage or inflammation. In
adults, widespread pain is associated with altered processing in the central nervous system (CNS), is more
common in females, and is accompanied by a cluster of co-occurring centrally-mediated somatic symptoms,
including fatigue, sleep disturbances, memory difficulties and depression/anxiety. The alterations in CNS
processing typically fall into two broad categories: increased pronociceptive and decreased antinociceptive
activity and functional connectivity. While there is strong evidence that adults with conditions characterized by
widespread pain, such as fibromyalgia, can trace their pain back to childhood and adolescence, the lack of
information about the development of widespread pain in children has made it impossible to tell whether these
co-occurring symptoms and CNS changes precede, correlate with, or are consequences of pain. The
Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a large prospective cohort study of childhood
development, provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore the early genesis and trajectory of widespread
pain in adolescence. Our overarching hypothesis is that CNS factors and clinical outcomes shown to be
associated with widespread pain in adults, are also present in children who are at risk for developing
widespread pain early in life. Moreover, we hypothesize that there is a sex-related divergence in these factors
during pubertal development which leads to an increase in pain sensitivity and vulnerability in females and a
decrease in males. To test these hypotheses, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1: Examine clinical and
neurobiological differences in children with widespread pain. We will compare symptoms, resting state brain
connectivity and gray matter structure in children (ages 11/12) who report widespread pain versus pain-free
controls. Aim 2: In a new cohort of pain-free children, determine clinical and neurobiological risk factors for
developing widespread pain two years later. We will compare commonly co-occurring non-painful symptoms,
brain structure and connectivity from pain-free children (ages 11/12) who develop new widespread pain at
ages 13/14, versus children who do not develop pain. Aim 3: Explore clinical and neurobiological sex
differences in the trajectories of widespread pain as youth transition through puberty. The proposed study will
be the first appropriately powered longitudinal study to examine newly incident widespread pain in children and
examine both clinical and neuroimaging predictors. This knowledge could help identify children at high-risk for
chronic widespread pain in adulthood and provide a window of opportunity for early interventional strategies."

Heterozygous germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L have recently been described as a new class of MDS
predisposing lesions and are present in approximately 10-20% of pediatric MDS cases. We and others have
shown in published reports that MDS-associated germline mutations in SAMD9/9L increase the antiproliferative
activity of the encoded protein and lead to hypocellular bone marrow with decreased myeloid cell numbers. In
addition, we have shown that the development of a myeloid disease is associated with partial or full loss of
chromosome 7 that results from the non-random loss of the pathologic mutation. Interestingly, somatic revertant
mutations including in cis single nucleotide changes and conversion of the mutant allele to the wild-type through
uniparental disomy occur in some cases which leads to hematopoietic recovery. Remarkably, some patients
with monosomy 7, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of MDS, also achieve hematopoietic recovery through
spontaneous disappearance of the monosomy 7 clone. These data lead to the hypothesis that gain-of-
function (GoF) SAMD9/9L proteins are cytotoxic and cause strong selective pressure for cells lacking
the mutant allele. The molecular mechanisms through which SAMD9/9L GoF mutations inhibit myelopoiesis,
and the spectrum of secondary mutations leading to either MDS, MDS/AML (e.g. SETBP1), or spontaneous
recovery is unknown. The proposed studies will investigate these questions through two specific aims: 1.) to
determine the molecular and functional impact of mutant SAMD9 and SAMD9L expression during myeloid
differentiation using and iPSC model system of pediatric MDS, and 2.) to determine the clonal architecture of
cells expressing mutant SAMD9 and SAMD9L using serial patient samples and single cell genomics.
A Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) will provide the candidate with the
amount of protected time needed to achieve his career goal of independence as a physician scientist and focus
on improving the clinical outcomes of pediatric MDS patients through understanding the mechanisms of their
disease pathogenesis. A strong career development plan including an experienced and successful faculty
advisory committee, clear plans for progress assessments, and attendance at numerous courses, lectures, and
workshops to increase proficiency in technical and management skills will accompany these research goals to
ensure success as an independent physician scientist. This award will be completed at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital (St. Jude), one of the world’s leading academic institutions focused on the research and
treatment of pediatric catastrophic diseases, making it an exemplary location for an early career physician
scientist to develop his career. In addition to the strong institutional support, St. Jude offers unmatched research
support with facilities including the Genome Sequencing Facility at the Hartwell Center, a Flow Cytometry and
Cell Sorting Shared Resource, and the Center for Advanced Genome Engineering (CAGE)."

 In this Emerging Global Leader Award application, Dr. Sitara Ajjampur plans to study the effect of
community-wide deworming on hookworm modulated immune responses to bystander antigens and vaccines
in Southern India. This research will be built onto an ongoing community-based cluster randomized trial
(Deworm3 study). This study has potential ramifications for 2 public health concerns in India: community-
wide deworming and improving response to vaccination in young children. The long-term goal of this
application is to establish an independent research program on helminth and parasitic infections in India.
This is in keeping with the objective of the K43 award to launch and support independent research careers
in LMIC in fields that align with public health priorities.
 Dr Ajjampur plans to build on prior experience in the conduct of epidemiological and laboratory-based
studies with guidance from highly eminent mentors. The protected time made available on this award, will
allow her to have a broad-based focus with hands-on laboratory training in immunoassays as well as flow
cytometry and laboratory aspects of vaccinology. She will also have training in study design, quantitative
research methods in infectious disease epidemiology, statistical analysis including regression analysis and
meta-analysis. She will work with her mentors on systematic reviews to further develop manuscript and data
visualization skills to publish in top-tier journals. She plans to train in qualitative research methods and
implementation science to understand the efficacy of intervention strategies, as applied to neglected parasitic
infections and translate research findings to policy change.
 Previous work has described the role of anti-helminthic therapy in reversing the immunomodulatory
effects of hookworm infection on protective responses to other bacterial or viral pathogens as well as vaccine
responses. In India, a combination of an excellent field site and staff following up the Deworm3 study cohort
population where a predominance of hookworm infection has been found; and a strong research facility with
mentorship from eminent leader in the field, from Christian Medical College, Vellore and the NIH, provides a
tremendous opportunity to comprehensively dissect the immunological effects of community-wide deworming
in these populations and determine whether these effects are sustained in the post-deworming period.
Specific indicators will include studying the effect of community-wide deworming on 1) immune homeostasis
in adults 2) immune response to unrelated but common bystander antigens (M. tuberculosis) in adults and
3) vaccine response to Diphtheria, Pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae b in children. The study duration
will be 5 years with an initial run-in period followed by recruitment and testing samples from hookworm-
infected and uninfected adults. In addition, a cohort of children recruited in the post-natal period (under 6
weeks) will be followed up to the age of 3 years to assess the longitudinal immune response to vaccines ."

 Chronic pain impacts a large proportion of the US population with estimates ranging from 10-40% of adults.
Opioids and related medications are among the most frequently prescribed medications for treating chronic pain,
albeit with considerable risks due to overdose, constipation, addiction and other serious side-effects. Over the
past decades our understanding of the neural circuitry responsible for nociception and anti-nociceptive therapies
has revealed several molecular targets that are potential therapeutic targets for non-opioid pain relieving
medication. Among these are the Mas-related G protein coupled receptors (MRGPRs). The first MRGPR was
discovered in 1986 and since then they have been found to encompass an ~40-member family of GPCRs that
are highly localized to primary sensory ganglia. MRGPRs are divided into 9 major families (viz. MRGPRA
through MRGPRH and MRGPRX) and, of these, the MRGPRX-family of receptors has been highlighted as a
‘primate-exclusive’ group enriched in human sensory neurons.
 We have recently shown that MRGPRX2 likely mediates the mast-cell dependent hypersensitivity responses
caused by prescription opioids and related medications. We have also with collaborators reported that a
polymorphism in MRGPRX4 mediates the preference for mentholated cigarettes among individuals with African
ancestry. The mechanism(s) by which opioids and other drugs interact with MRGPR-receptors is unknown and
here we will elucidate their mechanism(s) by structural biological investigation of these enigmatic receptors.
Using these structures we will discover and optimize chemical tools with which to modulate their function. These
studies will lead to an enhanced understanding of MRGPR-receptor structure and function. The findings may
accelerate the search for medications devoid of MRGPR-mediated side effects and which may function as
therapies for diseases linked to MRGPR-receptor dysfunction."

10763782,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important human pathogen that can cause severe liver diseases. There are
approximately 250 million people in the world that are chronically infected by this virus, resulting in nearly 1
million deaths every year. The current therapies for HBV patients do not generate sustained response in the
great majority of HBV patients. Thus, there is an urgent need of better treatments for HBV patients. This, however,
will require a better understanding of the life cycle of HBV for the identification of new therapeutic targets.
Autophagy is a catabolic process that is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent studies indicated
that HBV could induce autophagy to enhance its replication. By using cell cultures and transgenic mice that
carried the entire HBV genome, we previously demonstrated that autophagy was required for HBV DNA
replication both in vitro and in vivo. In our preliminary studies, we further discovered the association of DNA
replication-competent capsid particles with autophagosomes in hepatoma cells transfected with the HBV
genomic DNA. Interestingly, this association was not detected if the HBV core protein, which forms the viral
capsid, was expressed by itself. Our further analysis indicated that the HBV capsid particles were also associated
with phagophores, the membrane precursor of autophagosomes, regardless of whether the core protein was
expressed from the viral genome or by itself. These results, together with the previous reports that genes
essential for the formation of phagophores were required for the assembly of HBV capsid particles, indicated an
important role of autophagic membranes in HBV capsid particle assembly, maturation and trafficking. During this
grant period, we will continue these novel findings to further investigate the role of autophagy in the HBV life
cycle. Specifically, we will study the biological significance of the autophagosome-associated HBV nucleocapsids
and their possible role in the morphogenesis and egress of HBV particles, the role of phagophores in the
assembly of HBV capsid particles, and the mechanism that regulates the association of HBV nucleocapsids with
autophagosomes. These studies will provide important information for us to further understand the role of
autophagy in the HBV life cycle and facilitate the development of better treatments for HBV patients."

 The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate at the molecular and cellular levels how chemosensory
systems function and evolve so as to generate new behaviors that are adaptive to new environments. It focuses
on one of the most ancient and fundamental problems in biology: how sensory systems adapt to allow an
organism to exploit a new environment.
 Drosophila suzukii provides an excellent opportunity to decipher chemosensory mechanisms that have
contributed to its unique oviposition behavior. Whereas other species of Drosophila lay eggs in fermenting fruit
of no value, D. suzukii lays eggs in ripe fruit, ruining crops. The oviposition preferences of flies are based largely
on taste. This proposal takes advantage of the wealth of knowledge about the mechanisms of taste in D.
melanogaster. We aim to elucidate how these mechanisms have changed in D. suzukii to produce a preference
for ripe, as opposed to overripe, fruits.
 The first aim will provide a rigorous analysis of the expression and functional requirements of candidate
genes in the oviposition shift of D. suzukii. The experimental plan is designed to test hypotheses as to molecular
mechanisms underlying the oviposition shift of D. suzukii.
 The second aim will provide a rigorous analysis of the role of candidate genes in oviposition preference
for individual candidate oviposition cues. The proposed experiments are designed to identify key oviposition
cues, to test them behaviorally, and to examine the role of candidate genes in the oviposition preference to them.
 The third aim takes advantage of a recent advance in electrophysiology that allows an unprecedented
view of how a taste system has evolved at the cellular level. It will elucidate the cellular basis of a major shift in
oviposition behavior that has immense economic implications. It may decipher the molecular logic of taste coding
of a complex natural stimulus.
 Advances in understanding how the chemosensory systems function and evolve may lead to new means
of controlling agricultural pests and insect vectors of human diseases, which afflict hundreds of millions of people
each year."

Antibody-mediated mechanisms leading to acute and chronic renal allograft injury and loss remain poorly
understood. Investigation into these mechanisms is hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models to study
the development of allograft injury as the donor-specific antibody (DSA) response is initiated and progresses.
We have developed a novel model of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) of kidney allografts in CCR5-/-
recipients where DSA elicited in response to complete MHC-mismatched renal allografts are >50-fold higher
than the titers elicited in wild-type recipients. The allografts are acutely rejected by the DSA in CCR5-/- recipients
between days 17 and 22 with features that are virtually identical to those during acute ABMR of clinical kidney
grafts, including identical histopathology and gene expression signatures indicating NK cell activation. We have
recently demonstrated NK cell activation within the kidney allografts that is required for acute ABMR. In the
absence of NK cell activation, however, the high DSA titers induced in CCR5-/- kidney allograft recipients are
incapable of mediating acute ABMR but slowly induce development of tubular fibrosis and chronic glomerular
injury that leads to eventual graft failure similar to that observed during late failure of clinical kidney transplants.
Our preliminary results further indicate marked changes in the phenotype and functional transcriptome of graft
infiltrating monocytes and macrophages during chronic vs. acute ABMR. Development of the chronic ABMR is
also accompanied by the appearance of antibodies to several autoantigens that is not observed during acute
AMR. These results suggest the generation of altered myeloid cells and autoantibodies as key mechanisms
underlying the development of this chronic pathology and have led us to hypothesize that DSA binding to kidney
allograft endothelium in the absence of NK cell activation stimulates production of myeloid cell recruitment and
differentiation factors that skew their function to promote autoantibody production and development of chronic
antibody-mediated graft injury. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will
test mechanisms of DSA-induced kidney allograft endothelial production of factors directing myeloid cell
recruitment and function during development of chronic ABMR. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the role and
functions of graft infiltrating myeloid cells that promote development of antibody-mediated allograft injury. In
Specific Aim 3 we will test the production and role of auto-antibodies in the development of chronic ABMR. The
proposed experiments will utilize novel and clinically relevant models of kidney allograft chronic ABMR to directly
identify the inflammatory components and their mechanisms mediating chronic injury of the kidney grafts late
after transplant. We anticipate that our studies will continue to reveal novel mechanisms critical to the
development of kidney graft chronic ABMR and to identify new therapeutic targets to inhibit or attenuate this
pathology and improve kidney graft function and survival."
10763798,"The purpose of this K99/R00 application is to (1) provide me with necessary training in research and
career development for my transition to a successful independent researcher; (2) study the role of
pyroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, in the rupture of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).
AAA is a progressive pathological dilation and weakening of the aorta. AAA is associated with extreme
rates of death (up to 80%) in the event of aortic rupture. There has no medical therapy to prevent or treat
aortic rupture, which is largely attributed to that mechanisms underlying AAA rupture have not been
defined. AAA is characterized by inflammation and frequent presence of thrombus. Inflammatory lesions
often contain dead cells. Until recently, programmed cell death was thought to occur only in one form,
called “apoptosis”. In 2015 and 2016, four Nature publications from three groups revealed gasdermin D
(GSDMD)-dependent mechanisms of pyroptosis. GSDMD forms pores on cell surface and ruptures cell
membrane. In ruptured cell membrane, phosphatidylserine, which is exclusively located in the inner
monolayer in living cells, freely flip into outer monolayer and forms a procoagulant surface for tissue
factor by facilitating the assembly of proteins of clotting cascade. We recently discovered that
macrophage pyroptosis caused septic death through tissue factor release, which triggered disseminated
intravascular coagulation in mice. My preliminary data show that genetic deficiency of GSDMD protects
against AAA rupture in angiotensin II-infused mice. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that
macrophage pyroptosis promotes AAA rupture through tissue factor-dependent thrombus propagation.
Two aims will be addressed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, I will profile macrophage pyroptosis in
angiotensin II-induced AAA rupture using caspase-1 and Caspase-11 deficient mice (K99 PHASE). In
Aim 2, I will determine how macrophage pyroptosis, through tissue factor-mediated mechanisms,
contributes to AAA rupture (R00 PHASE). Together I will examine the causal relationship between
thrombus and AAA rupture and test the concept of a feedforward loop between macrophage pyroptosis
and tissue factor/thrombus until AAA rupture. This project is important because GSDMD and pyroptosis
may represent a therapeutic target. This project is innovative because it defines a novel procoagulant
mechanism in AAA. I will also examine macrophage biology and pyroptosis in human aortic aneurysm
tissues available in Dr. LeMaire’s Aortic Disease Biobank at Baylor College of Medicine to enhance the
translational aspects of my proposed research."

 In a seminal paper, Sarwal et al.1 reported that the presence of a B cell gene signature and dense clusters
of B cells in the renal biopsies was strongly associated with glucocorticoid-resistant T cell-mediated graft
rejection (TCMR) and kidney allograft loss. They proposed a hypothesis that, despite standard of care
immunosuppression, infiltrating B cells play a pivotal role in a subset of acute cellular rejection of kidney
allografts in the clinic. While some subsequent studies supported this hypothesis, others reported opposite
outcomes. As a result, the role of intrarenal B cells in clinical TCMR is currently unclear, and an understanding
of their role is urgently required to allow clinicians to rationally decide if B cell depletion might be useful for
reversing steroid-resistant TCMR. We hypothesize that the identification of additional features of intrarenal B
cells or of the rejecting biopsy are required to more accurately predict poor graft outcome and the need for B
cell depletion to treat TCMR. These features include an understanding the specificity of intrarenal B cells and
their functional properties, as well as the inflammation architecture of the biopsy. To this end, we have
developed two innovative approaches to understand in situ adaptive T and B cell immunity in human biopsies
from rejecting kidney allografts. First, we are able to pair the transcriptional state in single B cells with the
antigenic specificity of the antibody they secrete. Sorted B cells from renal biopsies are subjected to single cell
(sc) RNA-Seq, and the immunoglobulin variable regions are cloned from these same cells and expressed
corresponding antibodies. Second, we have developed a novel approach to characterize the spatial
architecture between different immune cell populations in human tissue and identify functional relationships2,3.
Using a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), coupled to a tuned neural network (TNN), we can
accurately capture T cell shape change upon recognition of antigen presented by dendritic cells (DCs) in
multicolor confocal micrographs. Therefore, this analytic pipeline (Cell Distance Mapping, CDM) can identify
and quantify antigen presentation in fixed tissue samples from both mice and humans. We will use CDM to
study T cell interactions with B cells or dendritic cells (DCs) in rejecting kidney biopsies. Third, we developed a
mouse model of kidney transplantation to address mechanistic questions raised by observations made from
the human renal biopsies. We will apply these three approaches to test our project hypothesis in two Aims:
 Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that the different transcriptional and functional states of intrarenal B cells during
rejection are associated with B cell receptor (BCR) specificity and rejection type.
 Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the type of cellular rejection (T cell mediated rejection vs. mixed T cell- and
antibody-mediated rejection) is defined by characteristic in situ cellular interactions between T cells and B cells
or DCs that are amenable to specific therapeutic intervention."

Understanding Cross-National Health Differences at Older Ages and Their Causes
This project aims to foster understanding of cross-national differences in health and their causes, especially
evaluating differences in health care systems, coverage and quality, health behaviors, life styles, income and
wealth distributions and historical life circumstances. Understanding differences and causes requires
comparable measurements of health which do not suffer from cross-national differences in data collection and
reporting styles. In this respect, analyses of blood samples are a gold standard of objective health measurement.
The project will extend earlier blood-based health comparisons between the US (based on the Health and
Retirement Study, HRS) and the UK (based on the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, ELSA) to Continental
Europe (based on the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe, SHARE). SHARE is a large
population-representative panel study modelled after the HRS and ELSA. Health variables strictly harmonized
across the three studies include self-reported health, ADLs and IADLs, physical measurements such as grip
strength, peak flow and chair stand, and a large battery of tests for cognition and mental health. SHARE has
obtained very rich data on health care systems and life styles, on economic, work and social circumstances over
the life course, and individual histories of health behaviors and health care interventions.
SHARE has also collected dried blood spot samples (DBSS) from about 27.000 respondents aged 50 and older
in 13 Continental European countries. HRS has also collected DBSS in recent waves. While DBSS are not perfect
substitutes for the venous blood (VB) samples obtained by ELSA and currently by HRS, much progress has
recently been made in understanding how values obtained from DBSS correspond to VB values. We have
performed extensive validations which show a tight alignment between DBSS and VB values after correcting for
systematic factors that occur during the laboratory and field processes.
The project has four specific aims:
1. Capitalize upon the expertise of the laboratory at the University of Washington by having the full set of
 DBSS collected in SHARE wave 6 assayed for the lipid panel and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
 biomarkers relevant to general health and cognitive decline.
2. Link the laboratory analyses with the SHARE functional and subjective health, demographic, social, and
 economic data, create a user-friendly database and archive it.
3. Harmonize the data obtained from the assays of SHARE DBS, ELSA VB and HRS DBS and VB.
4. Use these data to perform statistical analyses on the relationships between cross-national differences in
 health, economic, work and social circumstances, health behaviors and health care interventions."

Advances in B cell biology and molecular virology have enabled the discovery, characterization, and commercial
development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). They are a promising immunotherapy that can be
incorporated in many strategies for the treatment and/or cure of HIV-1. Antibodies have many effector functions
beyond neutralization and their most important mechanism of action for treatment/cure may be their ability to
opsonize infected cells, tagging them for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP)
by immune effector cells. It is not clear that bNAbs are mediating clearance of infected cells in clinical trials when
they are passively infused into chronically infected people living with HIV (PLWH). An obvious reason for this
lack of efficacy of bNAbs may be a lack of Env protein expression while on suppressive ART. Our lack of
knowledge about the level of Env expression during HIV latency and latency reversal prevents effective use of
bNAbs as therapeutics. To address this gap, the ability to detect low level Env protein expression in cells infected
with different subtypes of HIV-1 is needed. The Bosque lab has published an ultrasensitive method to detect p24
Gag protein down to the fg/ml level and has preliminary data for a newly developed Env assay. Here we propose
to use these assays to detect low levels of Env and Gag protein in a well-described model of latency and compare
the data to Env surface expression as measured by flow cytometry (Aim 1). Within these assays, we have the
flexibility to test Env detection using bNAbs targeting different epitopes to probe for Env conformation (i.e., trimer,
monomer, etc) and extend these analyses to diverse HIV isolates from different subtypes to measure differences
in Env expression and latency attributable to genetically diverse virus (Aim 2). Knowing these crucial factors
about Env and Gag expression in a carefully controlled model of latency will allow us to further investigate HIV
protein translation in future studies using cohorts of PLWH. These studies will improve the ability of therapeutics
using Env-targeting strategies to target latently infected cells."
10763803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Factor XIa (fXIa), the protease form of the plasma protein factor XI (fXI), contributes to thrombin generation
primarily by catalyzing activation of factor IX (fIX). This appears to reflect an ancillary role in the host
hemostatic response to injury, as fXI deficiency causes, at most, a relatively mild bleeding disorder. Despite its
limited role in hemostasis, mounting evidence from human population studies and animal models support the
premise that fXI contributes substantively to venous and arterial thrombosis. This has lead to considerable
interest in therapeutic inhibition of fXIa, with the hope that such a strategy will produce a useful antithrombotic
effect, with a smaller impact on hemostasis than currently used anticoagulants such as heparin, warfarin and
newer direct oral anticoagulants. FXI is structurally distinct from the vitamin K-dependent coagulation
proteases that form the core of the thrombin generation mechanism. Indeed, fXI arose from a duplication of the
gene for prekallikrein (PK), the precursor of the protease -kallikrein. PK, along with factor XII (fXII) and high
molecular weight kininogen (HK) form the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), a component of the innate immune
response that generates proinflammatory peptides in response to injury. As a homolog of PK, fXI retains
activities of the parent molecule. However, fXI has acquired unique features that facilitate its interactions with
the thrombin generation mechanism. Our current working model is that fXI functions as a bi-directional
interface between thrombin generation and the KKS, and that this places it in a position to influence the effects
of both systems on thrombotic and inflammatory processes. Work in our laboratory is directed at establishing a
better understanding of the biochemistry, molecular biology and pathophysiology of fXI, and its relationships
with thrombin generation and the KKS. We take a broad approach to this problem, which is reflected in the
three Focus Areas described in this application. Focus Area 1 investigates important structure-function
relationships in the fXI molecule that are relevant to its activity in flowing blood. Focus Area 2 will investigate
the contributions of fXI, fXII, PK and HK to thrombus formation and sepsis in mouse models. We will also
investigate the role of fXI in modulating bleeding tendency in mice lacking factor IX (a model of hemophilia B),
and pursue a recent observation that the majority of fXI in the vasculature forms a non-circulating pool
associated with the blood vessel wall. Finally, work in Focus Area 3 is directed at a better understanding of
fXII, the precursor of a protease (fXIIa), that activates fXI and PK, and that contributes to thrombo-inflammatory
processes. We strongly feel that the expertise in our laboratory at Vanderbilt University, and the stellar group of
collaborators in academia and industry that have worked with us for over a decade, place us in a unique
position to make important contributions to the field of thrombosis research, with the goal of better informing
efforts to develop novel antithrombotic therapies."
10775805,"There is an urgent clinical need to develop new therapeutics to promote healing of bone. While most
bone injuries heal, many do not, particularly large defects. Understanding cellular signaling mechanisms that
regulate normal healing, can lead us to new therapeutic targets. Notch signaling regulates the expansion and
differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC) and regulates vascularization of many tissues,
including bone. Our studies, and published studies from other investigators, show that Notch signaling is a
key regulatory pathway during bone healing. Indeed, our preliminary and published results show that
increasing Notch signaling in MPCs improves bone regeneration, and that global inhibition of Notch using
various models, deleteriously impacts healing. To sufficiently advance our understanding of Notch signaling
in bone healing, and translate these mechanistic observations, will require robust experimentation, including
preclinical studies in relevant injury models. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically relevant approach
to increase Notch signaling that enhances bone healing.
 We hypothesize that Notch signaling promotes expansion of MPCs and callus vascularization, leading
to enhanced bone formation. We will interrogate the Notch signaling pathway during bone healing to reveal a
deeper understanding of ligands and receptors that are at play during healing, and the cell-type specific
expression of these signaling components. This work will be completed in two specific Aims, using state of
the art mouse models. In the first Aim, we will study the role of Notch ligands. Our work has previously
demonstrated that Jagged1 is the dominant Notch ligand expressed in MPCs and the osteochondrogenic
lineage. We will disrupt Jag1 specifically in MPCs, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and osteocytes in the callus
during fracture healing. Additionally, as Jag1 and Dll4 produced by endothelial cells regulate vascularization,
we will determine which is the dominant ligand regulating vascularization using conditional deletion of both
ligands from endothelial cells using Cdh5-CreER. A spectrum of fracture healing outcomes, including
vascularization, as well as effects on endothelial cell and MPC proliferation and MPC differentiation will be
determined in vivo. We will capitalize on our extensive experience using inducible Cre mice to ensure normal
development thereby by-passing developmental effects of ligand disruption. These studies will be
complemented with a translational study in which Jag1 protein, alone or in combination with an existing
therapy, BMP2, will be delivered during healing of critical sized femoral defects. In the second Aim, we will
examine the role of Notch receptors on MPC and endothelial cells using Notch1 or Notch2 floxed mice. We
will determine whether these receptors are critical for defect healing driven by BMP2 or Jag1. This study will
significantly advance the field by clarifying the cell-specific role of ligand and receptor during bone healing,
and provide the preclinical relevance for local activation Notch signaling to increase bone defect healing."

The pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of Amyloid (Aβ) plaques
and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). While the presence of both plaques (A+) and tangles (T+) are essential to
the biological definition of AD as recently codified in the ATN research classification framework, tau (T) is thought
to be the primary driver of downstream neurodegeneration (N) and the resulting cognitive impairment. However,
there is substantial variability in the T-N relationship – manifested in higher or lower atrophy than expected for
the level of tau in a given brain region, even in carefully curated research cohorts. What does this variability
represent? In this study, we explore the idea that a quantitative measure of the variability in the canonical
relationship between T and N is itself a “mismatch metric” that can help characterize different underlying
phenotypes and modulatory factors. We will examine this by modeling region-wise measures of T vs. N obtained
from in-vivo imaging in a cohort A+ symptomatic individuals. SUVR from tau-PET imaging and cortical thickness
from structural MRI will serve as regional measures of T and N respectively. We will then use data-driven
clustering for phenotype discovery based on the model residuals. Region-wise model residuals capture spatial
variation in the T-N relationship, conceptually extending the ATN framework from the dichotomous T/N +/-
designations to a richer description that may reflect differing spatial topography of underlying co-pathologies.
 The concept of the T-N mismatch metric and its ability to identify underlying phenotypes will be evaluated
in multiple publicly available and institutional datasets, each of which will provide a diverse collection of
phenotypes. We will also perform evaluation in a dataset of ex-vivo specimens of A+ individuals. We will obtain
quantitative measures of N from ex-vivo MRI as a semi-automated cortical thickness estimate, and of T using
digital histopathology techniques, in multiple brain regions. Gold standard histopathology measures (e.g. TDP-
43, alpha-synuclein, non-AD tau, vascular disease) obtained in these samples will help evaluate whether T-N
mismatch metric can help identify phenotypes with non-AD co-pathology. Finally, we will evaluate if the T-N
mismatch metric is predictive of future cognitive decline as well as rates of longitudinal neurodegenerative
changes in the brain."

 There is currently a crisis in physician led research in academic medicine. The 2021 NIDDK Strategic Plan
for Research specifically recommended that there be an effort to “Bolster workforce development and training
to increase and diversify the pipeline of clinical investigators.” The report further emphasized the critical
importance of “Addressing the workforce pipeline at earlier career stages”. We believe that Medical Students
are at the peak of their formative transition, and thus engaging them in GI and liver disease research is highly
responsive to the NIDDK call for action. Training scientists in biomedical research requires specific scientific
expertise, including a firm understanding of topic matter and the ability to generate novel and relevant research
hypotheses. Through our expertise and experience, we are in an ideal position to provide the training
necessary for Student's long term success.
 Further, current evidence suggests that mentorship is one of the most critical requirements for successful
engagement of trainees at all levels, particularly in formative years of training, such in medical school. Multiple
scientific organizations have called for quality mentoring opportunities for trainees. A needs assessment of
MUSC Medical Students has identified 2 major areas of need related to GI and liver disease research on the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) campus. First, access to skilled and successful researchers is
required. Secondly, a structure around training and development of projects, embedded in a matrix of quality
mentorship, is required. Therefore, the overall objective of the MUSC Gastroenterology (GI) and
Hepatology Medical Student (MUSC-GIHMS) Training Program is to enable Medical Students to participate
in high quality research during their medical school training. Our vision is to provide access to quality
research projects, and while doing so, engage, inspire, and excite a diverse group of medical Students in the
field of GI and hepatology.
 In an effort to be highly responsive to the NIDDK Funding Opportunity announcement, PAR-21-034, the
Specific Aims of this application propose to (1) provide both a focused research experience during the spring
semester of second year for MUSC Medical Students, (2) to provide advanced curricular course work in
digestive and liver disease research for Students, and (3) to continuously evaluate and improve the program so
that it is sustainable over time. The current proposal will provide Students with an ideal setting to participate in
GI and liver disease research and ultimately through recruitment of these committed and diverse Medical
Students, will expand the pool of researchers engaged in GI and liver disease research."

Project-specific training opportunities for biostatisticians and data scientists are often not available outside of
certain advanced graduate (or occasionally undergraduate) degree programs. Lacking these opportunities, the
effectiveness of the biomedical workforce suffers due to shortages in qualified biostatisticians and data
scientists who can design efficient and robust studies that can be analyzed to produce reliable and
generalizable results and thus applied to the most important problems in health research. For this project, we
will focus on pairing undergraduates with biostatistics and translational mentors in areas of interest to the
NHLBI and NIAID to work on specific research projects. We propose to establish a Summer Institute in
Biostatistics and Data Science at the University of Texas Medical Branch to provide trainees with these
opportunities for direct, hands-on training. The objective of this project is to develop this training opportunity to
expose students to statistical design and analysis problems from real research, while providing them with the
conceptual and technical tools to address these problems. As such, students should be able 1) to assess study
designs for strengths and weaknesses in addressing specific biomedical questions, 2) to use the tools of
statistical modeling, data science, and hypothesis testing along with state-of-the-art statistical software to work
on problems as well as produce results and conclusions for these problems, and 3) to understand how
developing these skills can lead to a wide variety of career opportunities both inside and outside of academia.
The specific aims of this project are to develop an opportunity for students 1) to receive training in basic
biostatistics and data science methods in the context of compelling scientific questions and research data,
based on 2) the implementation of innovative educational approaches in describing analytic and computational
skills necessary to execute biostatistical research on projects relevant to the missions of the NHLBI and NIAID,
as well as 3) be provided with a program faculty-mentored independent research opportunity and 4) be
provided career guidance and development opportunities to trainees, and 5) to recruit a diverse group of
participants The application of this training will be guided by case studies stemming from projects in heart and
lung diseases as well as studies in infectious disease prevention, emerging infections, and immune-mediated
studies. This project is innovative in how it ties together active training in state-of-the-art statistical and data
science techniques using effective educational platforms tied with specific case study applications as well as
opportunities for career development. Our project is significant because developing a workforce knowledgeable
in biostatistical and data science applications of heart and lung diseases as well as studies in infectious
disease prevention, emerging infections, and immune-mediated studies research has been increasingly in
demand to improve the efficiency and reliability of biomedical innovation; this project represents an important
step in meeting this need."

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapy for a variety of blood disorders, but its use is limited by a high
rate of serious side eﬀects, including the development of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). The gut microbiome, or the
composition of microorganisms populating the digestive tract, plays a key role in triggering this inﬂammatory response,
and there is an urgent need to analyze patient microbiome proﬁles to both predict and mitigate risk of GVHD. However,
microbiome data pose a number of statistical challenges not addressed by existing methods due to high dimensionality,
heterogeneity across subjects, and complex phylogenetic relationships. In this proposal, we develop new data science
approaches to make sense of microbiome data, providing insight that can guide the development of future interventions
aimed at reducing GVHD incidence. We will develop accurate and eﬃcient methods for microbiome data analysis and
make them available in user-friendly formats. We focus on the development of novel methods for visualization and
prediction using microbiome data, as detailed in the following speciﬁc aims:
Speciﬁc Aim 1: To develop and evaluate advanced tools for visualization of microbiome data. The high
dimensionality and unique structure of microbiome data present challenges to eﬀective data visualization. In this aim,
we will develop approaches for both unsupervised and supervised visualization of microbiome data, along with an RShiny
app and QIIME2 plug-in that will make these tools accessible to both clinicians and bioinformaticians. The methods and
software resulting from this aim will provide robust approaches to enable researchers to better visualize global microbiome
heterogeneity across their study population, enhancing data exploration and identiﬁcation of potential confounding factors
or outliers.
Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop predictive modeling approaches for binary and survival outcomes. In this aim, we
will focus on selection of predictive microbiome features in the context of regression. We will carry out key advances
enabling the eﬀective application of sparse modeling to predict GVHD risk: novel statistical approaches to handle binary
and time-to-event outcomes, including those with competing risks, and computationally eﬃcient implementations, to be
made freely available as both an R package and RShiny application.
Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop methods for understanding the impact of rare features. Current microbiome proﬁling
methods allow for very ﬁne resolution of the strains present in each sample. In this aim, we propose two methods to
understand the impact of rare features. We will ﬁrst develop a method to provide insight into kernel association results, by
obtaining estimated eﬀect sizes for individual microbiome features. We will then develop an approach for nonparametric
clustering of the regression coeﬃcients, which allows ﬂexible aggregation of the observed rare features.
Successful completion of this work will result in new statistical and computational approaches to provide insights into
microbiome data, generating hypotheses that can guide the development of future strategies to predict and mitigate
GVHD. These methods will be disseminated through easy-to-use and eﬃcient cloud-based software implementations."

 Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has become a pillar of clinical MRI with its uniqueness to probe tissue
properties well beyond the conventional MRI can achieve with its millimetric resolution. Most DWI applications
rely on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) which has been associated with tissue cellularity1,2. However, the
comprehensive properties of tissue cannot be adequately revealed by a single measurement3. Recent
publications indicated these hidden properties can be probed using specific portions of the b-value “spectrum”
in DWI4. For example, intravoxel incoherent motion model5–7 with low-b-values can characterize micro-
vascularity without contrast agent, presenting a potential for complementing dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
(DCE-MRI)8. High-b-value non-Gaussian models9–24 can probe microstructures as in the case with continuous-
time random walk model17,19,21,25,26 which can reflect tissue micro-structural heterogeneity, thus enable studying
microstructures beyond cellularity and vascularity. Recognizing the complexity of the breast tissue, the breast
imaging community has shown an increasing interest in incorporating advanced DWI into their breast MRI
protocols27. However, expansion of advanced DWI to the breast has not been fully achieved28,29 due to two major
challenges. Firstly, commercial single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI) is prone to image distortion, which is
exacerbated in the breast due to off-center setting30–37. Secondly, an integrated approach with multiple MRI-
based metrics has not been established for breast tissue characterization38,39. The main goal of this project is
to develop two imaging tools to enable a comprehensive characterization of breast tissue: (1) a novel, distortion-
resilient, and time-efficient DWI acquisition technique, and (2) an integrated multi-modal MRI analysis framework.
Our overarching motivation is to bring the advancements in multi-high-b-value DWI to the breast.
 The hypothesis is that breast neoplasm can be evaluated by characterizing tissue cellularity, vascularity,
and heterogeneity collectively; and these properties can be comprehensively probed by utilizing a set of DWI
parameters from the entire spectrum of b-values together with DCE-MRI metrics. The specific aims are:
1. To develop a novel, distortion-resilient, and time-efficient pulse sequence, Steer-PROP for breast DWI –
 SPREAD – that will enable DWI with a full spectrum of b-values from 0 to 3000 s/mm2.
2. To establish MRI-based metrics for characterizing tissue cellularity, vascularity, and heterogeneity; and to
 develop an integrated multi-modal MRI analysis framework – TERMINAL – for the breast.
3. To demonstrate a potential application of SPREAD and TERMINAL in the context of predicting response to
 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer.
 This project will provide novel tools to enable DWI acquisition with a full b-value spectrum and DWI
analysis for assessing malignancy and evaluating treatment response in breast cancer. Successful completion
of the project will serve as a prototype for the expansion of advanced DWI into breast imaging."

Women are at greater life-time risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One potential factor contributing to greater life-
time risk of AD is the midlife menopausal endocrine aging transition when multiple AD risk conditions can emerge
and which are consistent with prodromal / preclinical features of the disease. While estrogen or hormone therapy
administered when menopausal women are symptomatic could reduce risk of AD, the fear of breast cancer leads
many women to forego this approach. An innovative alternative to estrogen therapy is to target estrogen action
in brain while avoiding estrogen-associated proliferation in breast tissue. To achieve that goal, we propose Phase
2 clinical development of “PhytoSERM”, a selective estrogen receptor beta (ERß) modulator that promotes
estrogenic action through ERß in brain while inhibitory in reproductive tissue. PhytoSERM is a rationally designed
formulation of 3 phytoestrogens (each are Generally Recognized as Safe by the FDA). Our earlier NIA supported
PhytoSERM Phase 1b/2a clinical trial determined that PhytoSERM was safe and well-tolerated, exhibited
predictive pharmacokinetics in peri- and postmenopausal women and identified responder phenotype
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01723917). Proposed herein is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial to determine efficacy of PhytoSERM in symptomatic peri- and
post-menopausal women. Primary objectives are to determine safety and efficacy of PhytoSERM to sustain brain
glucose metabolism as determined by 18F-FDG- PET because the menopausal transition is accompanied by
reduction in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, which correlates with menopausal symptoms and progression of
AD biomarkers later in life. Secondary objectives will determine efficacy of PhytoSERM on: 1) cognitive function,
2) frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms and 3) changes in sleep quality and mood symptoms. Tertiary
objectives are to determine impact of PhytoSERM on exploratory MRI outcomes including 1) gray matter volume
in AD-vulnerable regions, 2) white matter fiber integrity by diffusion tensor imaging, (3) intrinsic connectivity
measured by resting state functional MRI, 4) cerebral blood flow determined by arterial spin labeling (ASL) and
5) blood-based biomarkers relevant to AD risk. The Phase 2 PhytoSERM clinical trial addresses multiple strategic
directions of the National Institutes on Aging’s 2020-2025: Aging Well in the 21st Century ref Specifically, Goal
C-3 to: “Develop effective interventions to maintain health, well-being, and function and prevent or reduce the
burden of age-related diseases” and “Conduct clinical studies / translation of new interventions to the clinical
setting.” Goal D-4: Translate basic discovery into effective treatment and/or prevention strategies for AD/ADRD
and” Goal F-4: Support research on women’s health.” PhytoSERM clinical trial also contributes to achieving the
National Alzheimer’s Disease Project Act (NAPA) to effectively prevent and treat AD by 2025 Goal 1B.
PhytoSERM addresses a critical unmet need in women’s health to reduce risk of Alzheimer’s in later life."
10778642,"The focus of this proposal is on ORMDL3 a gene on chromosome 17q21, which has been highly linked to
human asthma in several genome wide association studies. As ORMDL3 is highly expressed in CD4+
cells, in this proposal we seek to determine how ORMDL3 influences CD4+ cell function, allergic
inflammation, and asthma. Although the linkage of chromosome 17q21 to asthma is very well established,
the biologic mechanism(s) underpinning this association in lung cells pertinent to the pathogenesis of
asthma is not as well understood and is the focus of this proposal. In addition as there are at least 9 genes
located in this region on chromosome 17q21 understanding the biology of each of these genes individually
is important to understanding how this region influences the development of asthma. As the SNP linking
ORMDL3 to asthma is associated with increased levels of ORMDL3 expression, we generated universal
ORMDL3 transgenic (TG) mice that express increased levels of human ORMDL3 (hORMDL3) and
demonstrated that they spontaneously (in the absence of allergen exposure) develop significantly
increased ASM and increased AHR, major features of asthma. In addition to this important baseline effect
of ORMDL3 in ASM on AHR, ORMDL3 also plays a significant role in enhancing Th2 responses and AHR
as demonstrated in our studies of allergen challenged universal hORMDL3 TG mice. Thus, the focus of
this proposal is to increase our understanding of how ORMDL3 expressed in CD4+ T lymphocytes
enhances Th2 responses to allergen challenge. In this grant proposal we propose to demonstrate that
CD4+ cells (mouse and human) expressing increased levels of ORMDL3 have enhanced Th2 responses
in vitro and in vivo to house dust mite (HDM) allergen, and using proteomic and RNAseq approaches plan
to identify downstream pathways in HDM tetramer positive CD4+ cells that mediate this ORMDL3 effect.
Targeted knockdown or overexpression of pathways identified to be downstream of ORMDL3 will
demonstrate their contribution to the function of CD4 cells. Finally, we are using single base editing to edit
SNPs linked to ORMDL3 to determine which SNPs functionally regulate levels of ORMDL3, Th2
cytokines, and downstream pathways of ORMDL3."

Social behavioral impairments are common and highly disabling symptoms in many psychiatric disorders,
including depression and anxiety disorders that emerge in adolescence and young adulthood. The intrinsic
complexity of social behavioral outcomes have made understanding their underlying neural correlates difficult.
In particular, the molecular mechanisms regulating the development and function of social behavioral circuits
remain largely unknown. In this context, one potential candidate molecule is brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), a key regulator of neuronal synaptic plasticity that has been implicated in depression and anxiety
disorders, and is also highly expressed in brain regions implicated in social behaviors. Our central hypothesis is
that BDNF is required for the proper development during a peri-adolescent timeframe of a key orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC)-to-amygdala circuit that supports social approach behavior. Multiple studies in rodents, non-human
primates, and humans indicate that the OFC supports cost-benefit decision making, and encodes and updates
representations of the expected value of future outcomes, suggesting that the OFC may play a role in motivating
social approach behavior. Our extensive preliminary data in loss-of-function BDNF mouse lines support the
premise of the requirement of BDNF in the peri-adolescent development of OFC-amygdala circuits related to
social function. We propose to assess the impact of BDNF on the structural and functional development of this
OFC-to-amygdala circuit during the peri-adolescent period. We will use a live calcium imaging technique (fiber
photometry) to record the activity of this circuit during a repertoire of social behaviors. In addition, we will use
chemogenetic tools to bi-directionally modulate the activity of these neurons and to delineate more precisely
what aspects of social behavior are mediated by these OFC projections. Finally, we will utilize newly developed
viral reagents for circuit-specific and developmentally-timed manipulations of BDNF signaling. Our studies are
designed identify a new role for BDNF during peri-adolescence to establish optimal function of cortico-amygdala
circuits related to social behaviors."
10762976,"While the development of an HIV vaccine that can induce neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)
remains a top priority, nearly 3 decades of research in this arena has proven that this is a
daunting task. However, recent results from the modestly protective RV144 vaccine trial argue
that protection from infection can be achieved in the absence of nAbs and cytotoxic T cell
responses, and this protection and may be linked to the induction of functional antibodies (Abs)
that target specific epitopes on the viral V2 loop. Likewise, more than 3 decades of research
have pointed to a role for non-neutralizing, innate immune–recruiting Abs in antiviral control and
slower disease progression. Interestingly, over the last R01 funding period, it has become clear
that in both the setting of vaccine-induced immunity and natural infection, the most functional
antibody (Ab) responses are driven by HIV-specific IgG3 Abs. However, what these IgG3
antibodies target, how these IgG3 responses are induced, and most critically how they persist in
some patients has yet to be defined. Here, we hypothesize that the rules of long-lived IgG3
selection can be learned from both vaccination and natural infection, with the hope that
the induction of these potent humoral effector molecules prior to exposure to HIV may
lead to durable protection from infection. Therefore, in this application, we propose to
specifically dissect the specificity and functional profile of the HIV-specific IgG3 responses in
both infection and vaccination. Based on these results, we will isolate antigen-specific IgG3 B
cells to begin to learn the “rules” by which these B cells select a particular antibody subclass as
well as how these responses may be artificially skewed towards IgG3 with adjuvants, T cell
help, and/or cytokines. Together, these studies, linking antibody function to B cell programming
will provide a first-in-class composite picture of the evolution of protective functional Abs and
define the mechanisms by which protective immunity may be elicited through vaccination to gain
enhanced control over the virus."

Vascular integrity is critical for the prevention of tissue edema, thrombosis, inflammation, and hemorrhage.
Identifying new factors that influence vascular integrity positively or negatively can provide important
therapeutic options for maintaining vascular health. Over the last decade, my lab has taken unbiased genetic
approaches in mice to generate vascular phenotypes and to discern their mechanistic causes, and we have
seen a powerful theme emerge from our work: excessive proteolysis is detrimental to endothelial cells and to
vascular integrity in vivo. Although proteases are well recognized for regulating sprouting angiogenesis in new
vessels, there is still a gap in knowledge about their impact on the endothelium of established vessels.
Therefore, the objective of this NHLBI Emerging Investigator Award is to define the contexts and the
mechanisms through which proteases damage blood and lymphatic vessel integrity. We will approach this
broad objective by expanding on two research areas that are supported by our published and preliminary data.
First, we will examine extracellular matrix degradation in the context of protease-mediated vascular damage.
We will exploit our multiple genetic models with elevated protease activity to reveal commonalities in matrix
composition and fragmentation near sites of vascular rupture, and we will seek to discern the relative
importance of matrix scaffolding versus matrix/endothelial cell signaling in maintaining vascular integrity in vivo.
Secondly, we will focus on protease-mediated endothelial cell necroptosis. Necroptosis is a newly-identified
form of cell death, and little is known about its causes or effects in the vasculature. Our preliminary data
indicate that proteases can directly trigger endothelial cell necroptosis during embryonic development. We will
examine the mechanism through which this occurs and will determine the contribution of protease-mediated
necroptosis to various postnatal vascular diseases. The proposed research is paradigm-shifting because it
considers new roles for proteases in the context of vascular integrity and because it could generate new
therapeutic targets for pathologies associated with high protease activity and vascular fragility."

Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience deteriorations in glycemic control that can persist into
adulthood. Although family-based interventions are empirically supported to offset this adolescent risk, such
behavioral health services are rarely included in diabetes care. This K23 proposal seeks to bridge this gap
between research and practice by optimizing family-based programs to provide the most efficacious, judicious,
and streamlined intervention possible to adolescents with T1D. The proposed study aims to 1) pilot and
evaluate specific family-based intervention components, and 2) identify the factors that explain and influence
intervention effects. First, the candidate will use qualitative methods to pilot 3 intervention modules to assess
feasibility and acceptability. Each module corresponds to one of 3 critical family processes: parental
monitoring, parental involvement, and parent-adolescent conflict, each of which are empirically linked to
adolescent diabetes management and glycemic control and are common family-based intervention targets.
Next, the candidate will conduct an experimental trial of the intervention modules to evaluate their relative
efficacy as well as combined impact on adolescent outcomes. Finally, the candidate will conduct advanced
statistical analyses to verify the specific family processes (including both general and diabetes-specific) that
explain (mediate) program effects as well as the contextual factors that influence (moderate) intervention
effects. This proposal will yield an optimized family-based intervention as well as provide critical empirical
information about the causal pathways between family functioning, mental health, and glycemic control among
adolescents with T1D. The K23 award offers the training, mentorship, protected time, and resources necessary
to complete the proposed study and support Dr. Wong’s progress toward becoming an independent research
scientist in pediatric diabetes."

Intestinal microbiota are known to promote absorption of dietary fat and to confer susceptibility to diet-induced
obesity. However, there exist fundamental gaps in our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. Our long-term
goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions and lipid metabolism in the intestine
and how they contribute to human physiology and disease. Our preliminary studies in gnotobiotic and
conventional mice and zebrafish reveal that microbiota specifically suppress mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
(FAO) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and identify potential upstream microbial and transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms. Our genetic analysis in conventional mice also establishes that blocking FAO specifically in IECs
promotes dietary fat absorption and modulates intestinal and systemic energy metabolism. The overall objectives
of this project are to understand how microbiota regulate FAO in IECs, and define the impact of intestinal FAO
on intestinal and systemic physiology. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that specific
bacterial products downregulate FAO in IECs by suppressing FAO gene transcription, which in turn modulates
IEC fuel selection and differentiation and promotes positive energy balance. Our rationale is that an improved
understanding of how microbes influence intestinal FAO, and how FAO contributes to intestinal physiology and
systemic energy metabolism could lead to new strategies for controlling fat metabolism and energy balance in
humans and other animals. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify the host and microbial mechanisms by which
microbiota suppress FAO in the intestinal epithelium. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the roles of intestinal FAO
in fuel selection and differentiation of IECs, and in mediating the influence of the gut microbiota on systemic
energy balance. The expected outcomes will vertically advance the field in several ways. First, they will establish
intestinal FAO as a major determinant of intestinal and systemic energy balance. Second, they will provide
definitive new evidence that intestinal epithelial FAO is a major target of microbial regulation. Third, they will
show that the striking resistance of germ-free mice to diet-induced obesity is mediated by intestinal FAO. Finally,
they will provide a novel bacteria-host signaling pathway governing intestinal FAO. These results are expected
to have a significant impact because they are likely to lead to new microbe- and host-targeted strategies to
control energy balance in the context of obesity and malnutrition by manipulating FAO and associated gene
expression networks and metabolic pathways in the gut."

In this SBIR grant proposal, “Ultra-low distortion and noise electronics to enable a clinical MPI imaging platform,”
we will develop the RF subsystem for a clinical magnetic particle imaging (MPI) platform to enable three classes
of MPI applications: cell tracking, functional imaging, and endogenous contrast imaging. Our overall approach is
to improve sensitivity and resolution by minimizing distortion, adding transmit/receive channels, decoupling,
improving preamplifiers, and developing new pulse sequences.
 MPI is an emerging molecular and tracer imaging technology that directly detects magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) with high sensitivity at mm-scale resolutions. MPI images are direct views of tracer distribution with no
signal arising from tissue, no perturbations from materials such as air, and image intensity directly linear with
tracer concentration. This “hot-spot” contrast provides spatial localization and quantification without ambiguity.
MPI’s contrast is similar to nuclear medicine but without the workflow, safety, and half-life limitations of a
radioactive tracer. MPI has many applications in the brain and body, as demonstrated by our customers in small
animals. Despite significant efforts by multiple institutions, the lack of a clinical MPI scanner remains a significant
limitation for the technique.
 In this Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal, we will advance the medical imaging field by building the world’s
first general-purpose clinical MPI scanner to serve the myriad applications our customers are testing on our
preclinical instrument. We will design and implement a new transmit/receive subsystem and install it in our
prototype scanner to achieve the performance necessary for clinical imaging applications. This new
transmit/receive subsystem includes the following innovations that push our sensitivity from our current rough
prototype to near the physics limit through the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. Drive transmit distortion and the noise floor to the physics limit for a one-channel Tx/Rx coil
 Aim 2. Design a clinical multi-channel transmit and receive subsystem
 Aim 3. Develop new acquisition pulse sequences to improve sensitivity, resolution, and speed"

 T cells are among the most diverse immunological cell types and are central to the pathology of
a broad range of human diseases. This diversity has largely been defined by their differential
expression of cell surface proteins and to a lesser extent, intracellular protein markers, using flow
cytometry. Although significant progress has been made, the field is unnecessarily limited by the lack
of available antibody reagents. Only 900 of the 20,000 known human proteins have validated flow
cytometry reagents, severely limiting the cellular phenotypes and responses that can be measured.
Indeed, recent studies using proteomics (mass spectrometry) and genomics (scRNAseq) have
identified hundreds of proteins that appear to be differentially expressed within T cell subsets,
suggesting that our current definition of T cells using flow cytometry is quite limited. However, other
antibody-based methods such as Western blot have antibodies available for more than half the
proteome. In our Phase I studies we developed the Exocells method that allows flow cytometry
samples to be processed using SDS and heat, similar to Western blot samples. This format makes the
flow cytometry samples amenable to staining with antibodies that are validated to work using Western
blots. This fundamental advance in flow cytometry sample processing promises to dramatically
increase the number of antibodies that can be used in flow cytometry to characterize T cell populations
and cell states. In the Phase II studies, we will further optimize the method and perform assay
qualification in primary cell samples. Using the optimized method, we will expand the existing repertoire
of T cell markers by more than 30%. Finally, using mass cytometry, which is capable of analyzing 40 or
more parameters per cell, we will create a T cell staining panel containing 25 known surface markers
and 15 of the newly discovered intracellular proteins. This panel will be a powerful tool for identification
of novel T cell subsets, for biomarker discovery in various T cell-mediated disease states, and for
analysis of immuno-oncology therapeutics. By significantly increasing the number of flow cytometry
reagents capable of differentially staining T cells, we seek to drive the discovery of the next generation
of T cell subsets and their role in human disease progression and therapeutic efficacy."
10762952,"Both environmental and genetic factors involved in the disturbance of cholesterol metabolism have been
suggested as risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulation of cholesterol has
been observed in affected brain areas from AD patients and animals, and it is associated with region-specific
loss of synapses. Elevated brain cholesterol causes cognitive deficits, amyloid-β (Aβ) production and
aggregation, and tau pathology. Despite these observations, the mechanisms that govern brain cholesterol
homeostasis and influence on neurons under AD-related pathological conditions remain elusive. In particular,
the field lacks knowledge on the factors that are involved in the signaling pathways of neuronal cholesterol
metabolism, related to the initiation and development of AD pathology. ATAD3A belongs to a new family of
eukaryotic mitochondrial AAA-ATPases. ATAD3A regulates cholesterol homeostasis and trafficking via an
unknown mechanism at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), a specialized subdomain of the
ER that has the features of a lipid raft and is rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin. Our recent work
demonstrated that ATAD3A, via pathological dimerization, showed a gain-of-function that caused
neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. We further observed an enhancement of ATAD3A oligomerization
in AD neuronal culture, in AD transgenic mouse brains and in AD patient postmortem hippocampus,
suggesting an aberrant activity of ATAD3A in the pathogenesis of AD. We developed a novel peptide inhibitor
DA1 that binds to ATAD3A to block ATAD3A dimerization. Notably, sustained treatment with DA1 reduced
APP level and amyloid load, attenuated neuro-inflammation and improved short-term spatial memory in 5XFAD
transgenic mice. Further, our proteomic analysis suggests that blocking ATAD3A oligomerization by DA1
treatment mainly influenced the cholesterol metabolic pathway in AD mouse brains. The treatment in AD
transgenic mice improved brain cholesterol turnover and did not affect brain phospholipids levels. Moreover,
we showed that DA1 treatment reduced cholesterol burden and oxidative stress in neuronal cells stably
expressing APP wt or mutant. These findings highlight ATAD3A oligomerization as a previously unidentified
mechanism underlying brain cholesterol disturbance and neurodegeneration in AD. Our central hypothesis is
that ATAD3A oligomerization mediates amyloid pathology, leading to neurodegeneration, by impairment of
brain cholesterol metabolism. The overall goal of this application is to understand ATAD3A aberrant
oligomerization-mediated neuropathology in AD, and to reveal a novel therapeutic target for AD. In Aim 1, we
will determine the impact of ATAD3A oligomerization on brain cholesterol homeostasis, AD pathology and
behavioral deficits in AD mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether haplosufficiency of ATAD3A in AD mice
restores brain cholesterol homeostasis and reduces AD pathology. In Aim 3, we will dissect the mechanistic
links between ATAD3A oligomerization and disturbance in brain cholesterol homeostasis in AD."

Background: The global burden of sepsis is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where epidemic HIV,
broad pathogen diversity, and limited critical care capacity challenge effective management of life-threatening
infections. In this context, where attempts to implement sepsis treatment protocols developed in high-income
countries (HICs) have failed to show benefit, data informing locally-relevant models of sepsis pathobiology are
scarce. As treatment responses likely depend, in part, on modifying complex host responses incited by an
array of pathogens, imprecise understanding of biological heterogeneity inherent to sepsis in SSA represents a
crucial barrier to development of effective management strategies. Research: The research component of this
proposal will utilize data and biological samples from NIAID- and foundation-funded prospective cohort studies
of sepsis in Uganda conducted through an established collaboration between Columbia University and Uganda
Virus Research Institute (UVRI). Within this framework, I will establish novel clinico-molecular sepsis subtypes
in Uganda using latent class analysis of clinical, microbiological, and host biomarker data (Aim 1); derive and
validate transcriptomic sepsis subtypes in Uganda by applying machine learning techniques to whole-blood
RNA sequencing data (Aim 2) and; determine innate and cell-mediated immune profiles associated with severe
organ failure and mortality in HIV-associated sepsis (Aim 3). Candidate: As outlined in this K23 Award
application, my career objective is to become an independent clinical and translational investigator focused on
sepsis and infection-related critical illness in resource-limited settings, with the goal to establish more precise,
biologically-informed clinical management strategies that can be tested in locally-relevant clinical trials. I am
well-qualified to undertake the scientific and training Aims proposed here, having spent much of the past
decade working to characterize the clinical and molecular epidemiology of emerging infections associated with
severe and critical illness in Uganda. Mentors/Environment: Under the primary mentorship of Dr. Max
O’Donnell, an R01-funded investigator at Columbia with >15 years of clinical research experience in SSA, I
have assembled a team of co-mentors and collaborators at Columbia (Dr. Ian Lipkin, Dr. Jason Che) and UVRI
(Dr. Barnabas Bakamutumaho) with expertise in patient-oriented and translational research in infectious
diseases and critical care, global health, molecular laboratory methods, and advanced biostatistics and
bioinformatics. Training: With guidance from my mentors and collaborators, I have crafted a rigorous five-year
career development plan that includes necessary training in: clinical study design, ethics, and conduct relevant
to resource-limited settings (Drs. O’Donnell, Bakamutumaho), high-throughput RNA sequencing and biomarker
measurement (Dr. Lipkin), advanced biostatistics and bioinformatics (Dr. Che), and research dissemination
and professional development (all mentors). Completion of the proposed training and related Aims will facilitate
my development as an independent clinical-translational investigator and leader in global sepsis research."

 Immunotherapies are revolutionizing oncology allowing many cancer patients with aggressive disease to
enjoy durable remissions with excellent quality of life. However, these therapies are generally not effective for
patients with ""cold"" solid tumors that have few infiltrating T cells and low levels of antigen presentation. IL-12 is
a highly inflammatory cytokine with the potential to transform cancer immunotherapy. It can make ""cold""
tumors ""hot"", drive elimination of tumors as a single agent and synergize with checkpoint inhibitors and
adoptive cellular therapy in multiple experimental models. Despite multiple clinical trials of IL-12, using direct
intravenous administration or a variety of formulations and vehicles, finding an optimal delivery method
remains a critical barrier to its widespread clinical use. Several intra-tumor (IT) IL-12 gene delivery vehicles are
currently being tested clinically; however each of these has major drawbacks that could prevent general
implementation. Our group has been collaborating with the Seattle-based biotechnology company, Immune
Design, to test two separate, novel and highly promising IL-12-producing vectors for gene delivery. One uses a
potent self-replicating RNA delivery system to delivery high levels of IL-12 production through out the tumor.
The other uses a lentivirus with an envelope that specifically targets dendritic cells.
 While both experimental vectors can eliminate tumors and prevent re-challenge in murine models, the
significant investment required for clinical-grade virus production has impaired their swift movement into the
clinic. Using a large animal model to demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy in a spontaneous cancer will catalyze the
production of a clinical-grade product, thus in this proposal we will test both these vectors in spontaneous high
grade soft tissue sarcomas in companion animals. If both vector approaches are efficacious, the analysis
described here will help identify which vector should move towards testing in humans (using a human IL-12-
containing construct). Furthermore, our comparison of these two agents will answer a fundamental question in
cancer immunology; i.e., can precise delivery of IL-12 to DCs achieve superior anti-tumor immunity despite
fewer transduced cells and a lower overall level of IL-12 production?"

 (1) Our work is directed towards understanding the structure, organization, and anatomy of human memory.
We study neurological patients who have circumscribed memory impairment as the result of brain injury or
disease that has damaged the hippocampus bilaterally. We also study healthy volunteers using the technique
of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work is continuing to reveal useful and important
information about the organization of memory and the brain systems that support memory. In this work, I
collaborate with Christine Smith, Ph.D. at the VA (Research Health Science Specialist), who in 2016 obtained
independent VA funding. I also collaborate with Robert Clark, Ph.D. (VA investigator) in his program of work on
memory in rodents.
 Memory is a precious mental faculty. Lost or diminished memory, as occurs in neurological disease,
leads to a loss of self, a loss of one’s life history, and a loss of the ability to have enduring contact with other
human beings. Memory problems are common in VA neurological and psychiatric patients. Modest difficulties
with memory are of course well-documented as a universal feature of normal aging, and more severe memory
problems are a prominent early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. Our work is intended to learn how memory is
affected by these conditions, how the brain accomplishes learning and memory, and what brain structures are
important. Our neuropsychological work has provided new tests, the possibility of better and earlier diagnosis,
improved understanding of the conditions that affect memory, and established a clearer path to the
development of interventions for treating and ultimately preventing diseases that affect memory.
 During the past 10 years, our work has been reported in 95 publications, (53 peer-reviewed journal
articles, 20 books or book chapters, 18 invited reviews, and four other pieces). We explored a number of
issues that are prominent in current discussions about the organization of memory. We investigated how eye
movements can be experience-dependent (e.g., different depending on whether a scene is novel or recently
presented); the key distinction between conscious and unconscious memory systems; the function of the
hippocampus with respect to the constructs of recollection and familiarity; the brain-based distinction between
short-term (working) memory and long-term memory; the role of the hippocampus and related medial temporal
lobe structures in recollecting the recent past, the remote past, and in imagining the future; the special status of
face recognition with respect to hippocampal function; the possible role of medial temporal lobe structures in
certain perceptual functions; and the role of these structures in navigation, scene construction, and spatial
cognition. Over my career, my work has been cited 48,000 times and continues to be cited about 2000
times/year. My h-index is 108.
 Current work proceeds on several fronts. First, we are carrying out a number of studies supported by
the VA to illuminate the ways that eye movements can reflect memory. For example, individuals scan a scene
differently depending on whether the scene is familiar or novel. They make fewer fixations and sample fewer
regions when viewing a familiar (as opposed to novel) scene. What kind of memory effects are these? Do
these eye movement effects simply provide another example of conscious, declarative memory? Or, are they
more automatic, and independent of awareness that a scene is novel or familiar? Are they hippocampus-
dependent or independent? Do they honor or contradict the dominant view that conscious memory is
hippocampus-dependent? In other NIH-supported work we are exploring memory and spatial cognition, and
autobiographical memory. We are attempting to reconcile two traditions of work that emphasize the role of the
hippocampus in memory vs. its role in the ability to mentally construct scenes and navigate.

Immune signals profoundly influence brain physiology, and immune dysregulation is implicated in
neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, schizophrenia, as well as in the remodeling responses engaged
after brain injury. As such, there is a critical need to define the cells and molecules that mediate brain-immune
communication. Microglia, a type of glial cell, are the dominant immune cell in the brain parenchyma and play
key roles in synaptogenesis and synapse refinement during periods of brain remodeling. However, recent
discoveries have identified a rich array of immune cells in the meninges and perivascular barrier regions of the
brain. This raises the question of how these ‘border’ immune cells in and around the blood brain barrier impact
brain remodeling, including during development and after injury. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that a
subtype of immune cell known as group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) expand and are activated in the
developing brain meninges and larger perivascular areas. They secrete their canonical effector cytokine
Interleukin-13 with a peak at postnatal days 5-12, which coincides with a robust period of synapse refinement.
During development, we show that genetic depletion of ILC2s impaired cortical inhibitory synapse function
consistent with defects in GABA receptor subunit composition. These mice had impacts in social recall memory
in adulthood. Importantly, global deletion of the IL-4/IL-13 receptor phenocopied these synaptic defects, whereas
exogenous IL-13 had the opposite effects. Aim 1 will determine the cellular targets and impacts of IL-13 signaling
that mediate these synaptic and behavioral effects in development, based on preliminary data showing that
microglia and border associated macrophages express high levels of the IL-13 receptor, and have transcriptional
and morphologic responses to IL-13. In preliminary data to Aim 2, we identify a stromal fibroblast niche where
ILC2s reside within the developing meninges and use single cell sequencing to define stromal ‘adventitial
fibroblasts’ that produce ILC2-supporting signals. We demonstrate that these fibroblasts are sufficient to support
ILC2 expansion in vitro, and that they produce the ILC2-regulating signals Interleukin-33. Aim 2 will determine
how the meningeal stromal niche supports ILC2 expansion and IL-13 production in vivo, including testing the
role of meningeal derived IL-33. In preliminary data to Aim 3, we find that meningeal ILC2s become reactivated
and expand after photothrombotic brain injury, limiting post-injury hyperexcitability and damage and promoting
the expansion of protective microglial subsets. Aim 3 will determine the impact of ILC2s, IL-13, and their
downstream targets in inhibitory synapse remodeling during injury recovery. We will test the alterations in the
meninges that sustain this ILC2 expansion and test the hypothesis that IL-33 signaling during damage is required
for these changes. Together, these studies will help to define how immune cells in the brain borders impact the
developing brain and how these may drive both beneficial and pathologic responses during development and
neuroinflammation."
10754289,"Tourette Syndrome (TS) is characterized by multiple, persistent motor and vocal tics and affects approximately
1% of children worldwide. There is no cure for TS and efforts to develop novel treatments are hampered by our
limited understanding of the underlying neurobiology and brain structural and functional deficits. Although tics
represent the hallmark feature of TS, up to 90% of patients present with additional neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD up to 50% of TS patients), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD up to 54.3%), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD up to 20%), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD
up to 26%), and Anxiety Disorders (AXD up to 36%). These comorbidities contribute to decreased quality of life
and introduce etiological and phenotypic heterogeneity that further hampers efforts to elucidate the TS
neurobiology. Here, we are proposing to investigate TS-related brain structure and function at a large scale but
also to identify those factors that lead to high comorbidity with other disorders. Motivated by international
collaborative studies on the genetics and neuroimaging of TS led by the PI, we bring together all major worldwide
collaborative efforts on neuroimaging and genetics for TS and aim to integrate with equivalently large and already
existing studies of highly comorbid OCD, ADHD, ASD, MDD, and AXD. We take advantage of access to data,
resources and standardized pipelines from the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-
Analysis) consortium and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). First, we will establish the ENIGMA-TS
working group, for which PI Paschou has already laid the groundwork, with 17 sites from nine countries having
agreed to contribute existing neuroimaging and clinical data from 1,930 cases and controls. We will pool together
T1 structural imaging data as well as rsfMRI and DTI data. Second, we will pursue the largest neuroimaging
studies for TS to date aiming to understand the pathophysiology of the disorder. Pursuing cross-disorder
analysis, we will also integrate our TS neuroimaging data with existing ENIGMA data for the most frequently
comorbid disorders in TS (OCD, ADHD, ASD, MDD, and AXD). Third, we will aim to uncover brain regions that
correlate to genetic background in TS and related disorders. To do this we will analyze TS genomewide
association studies (GWAS) but also pursue cross-disorder GWAS for TS and comorbid disorders. We will
leverage our findings from the first large-scale cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis for TS, OCD, ADHD, ASD
(led by the PI), as well as access to data from ENIGMA GWAS on brain structure from more than 50,000
individuals and the UK Biobank on additional 10,000 individuals. Importantly, we will also leverage access to
population-based cohorts (ABCD and Generation R), with longitudinal brain imaging, clinical but also genetic
information in order to replicate our findings to diverse populations and explore correlations to behavioural
profiles moving beyond strict diagnostic categories. Ultimately, our findings will help elucidate brain structure and
function in TS but also disentangle relationships with comorbid OCD, ADHD, ASD, MDD, and AXD."

Apicomplexa parasites contribute significantly to human disease burden, including ~1/3 of human populations
permanently infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Existing treatments are limited and often toxic to the most affected
population of immunocompromised patients. We need a profound knowledge of parasite biology to develop
efficient anti-parasitic drugs. Our group focuses on the studies of cell cycle mechanisms that are central to
parasite survival and offer a wealth of druggable targets. The cell cycle program orchestrates cell division and
ensures the inheritance of the genetic material. Apicomplexan cell cycles are strikingly different from the cell
cycles of their hosts. Although T. gondii tachyzoite divides by endodyogeny that resembles a binary division of
the conventional eukaryotes, there are substantial differences in cell cycle organization and regulation. It includes
the atypical S-phase of Toxoplasma endodyogeny, which is a primary focus of our study. The need for
appropriate tools to examine the intricacy of the apicomplexan cell cycle and unconventional regulators
significantly impedes the related studies. To fill a major gap in our knowledge of the essential biology of
apicomplexan parasites and boost the Toxoplasma cell cycle studies, we engineered a new Fluorescent
Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) probe.
In the Aim 1 experiments, we will test the hypothesis that Toxoplasma endodyogenic cell cycle includes a
composite S/M/C phase that runs for nearly half of the division cycle. Using our new ToxoFUCCI probes, we
will determine how the intertwined S/M/C phase is organized. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism of
the S-phase regulation. Designed experiments will test the hypothesis that, contrary to conventional S-phase
cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk), controlled release of the sequestrated Cdk-related kinase TgCrk5 regulates DNA
replication in the tachyzoites. Using the conditional expression model of TgCrk5, we will determine the functions
of the sequestered and the nuclear TgCrk5 and identify the TgCrk5 substrates. Given that T. gondii lacks
conventional S-Cdk substrates, we expect to discover a novel TgCrk5 network. The project will advance our
knowledge of the fundamental process of parasite survival and have a high potential to discover future efficient
drug targets."

 Cell fates are decided as an organism develops. In human development, pluripotent stem cells
differentiate into the three layers of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These classes of tissue further
differentiate into specific cell types with specific functions including neurons, immune cells, and skin cells. These
identities are stable; once a cell differentiates into its final state, it will not revert back to a stem cell state, nor will
it transform into another cell type. A skin cell will not spontaneously become a neuron, even if the neuron is
damaged. However, Takahashi and Yamanaka demonstrated that cells have the potential to revert back to a
stem cell fate when they reprogrammed mouse fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by forced
overexpression of stem cell-specifying transcription factors. In 2010, Vierbuchen and colleagues demonstrated
that fibroblasts could be reprogrammed directly to neurons using neuron-specific transcription factors, bypassing
the need for an iPSC-intermediate. However, reprogramming efficiencies in each of these systems was low; very
few cells are actually capable of changing their cellular identity.
 In 2019, Babos and Galloway greatly improve reprogramming efficiencies in direct motor neuron
reprogramming, demonstrating improved reprogramming yields 100 times greater than the original process.
They drew upon factors that enhanced another cell fate transition: cancer. Genes that promote a healthy cell’s
transition to cancer also improved the ability of a cell to change its cell type. Thus, reprogramming can serve as
a model of cancer initiation. By understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these oncogenes promote
reprogramming, we can understand how oncogenes evade cellular barriers to cancer and establish tumors.
In the F99-phase of the proposed research, I will investigate the role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in
oncogene-mediated reprogramming. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Rather than p53
expression being lost in cancer, it is most often mutated to create a protein unable to perform its designated
functions and accumulates to abnormally high levels. As a synthetic biologist, I will design synthetic gene circuits
that track and report p53 levels during reprogramming. I will isolate cells that accumulate p53 and investigate
their ability to reprogram.
 In the K00-phase of the proposed research, I will extend my investigations of p53 to three-dimensional
models of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at late stages, after the cancer has metastasized,
leading to poor patient outcomes. 3D models of tumor initiation can shed light on the early stages of ovarian
cancer and enable clinicians to catch the cancer early, when the disease is most easily treated. By inducing
cancer initiation in 3D models of ovarian cancer and tracking cancer progression using p53-sensors, I will identify
the drivers of tumor establishment and factors associated with early-stage disease."

 It is estimated that over 10 million Americans have peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Left untreated
PAD will lead to critical limb ischemia and eventual amputation. PAD symptoms often progress requiring one of
the following interventions: balloon angioplasty, stent placement, or vascular bypass. Balloon angioplasty and
drug eluting stents radially expand stenosed arteries -- a mechanical insult that damages the vessel leading to
restenosis and device failure. This failure mechanism leads to a two-year patency rate of 50% and 60% for
angioplasty and drug eluting balloons, respectively. 80 to 90% of patients with advanced PAD present with
disease in the femoral and popliteal arteries – where tortuosity and complex joint motion is common. These
complex bending forces exacerbate treatment challenges and often lead to stent fracture and increased rates
of restenosis. The gold standard treatment of PAD is surgical bypass, which itself displays a primary 2 year
patency rate of up to 67% for anatomically complex lesions. The unacceptable failure rates of all PAD
treatments clearly demonstrate the critical need for a more durable and successful treatment of PAD.
 Our team has developed the Biocarpet – a fully biodegradable electrospun sheet that takes the shape
of the patient’s vascular anatomy following deployment. Our approach not only imposes significantly reduces
vascular wall stress during deployment, but also allows the Biocarpet’s zero stress state to be that of the host
artery – which is often tortuous or anatomically complex. This is hypothesized to further reduce vascular injury
in response to intraluminal pulsation and joint flexion – a common occurrence in the stenotic vessels of the
lower limb peripheral vasculature.
 The overall goal of this Catalyze proposal is to finalize the Biocarpet design and prototype, establish
its deliverability and improved performance in-vivo, and make significant progress toward the clinical
translation of our technology. This goal will be met by completing the following objectives. The R61 phase of
this proposal has three Objectives: R61.1: Finalize the Biocarpet design, fabricate a device prototype, and
quantify its in-vitro deliverability and performance; R61.2: Establish the in-vivo deliverability of our device into
the bending joint of an atherosclerotic pig; R61.3: Generate a Regulatory Path document that details the
specific milestones that are required prior to a future FDA submission. The R33 phase of this proposal has two
objectives: R33.1: Demonstrate the improved in-vivo performance of our device compared to a gold standard
endovascular stent; R33.2: Generate a formal Business Model document detailing timeline to market, required
future investment, market analysis, and financial risk profile. Funding of this Catalyze award further integrate

10802437,"One-in-three children (ages 2-4 years), and one-in-two children living in poverty, do not get adequate 
sleep. These concerning sleep disparities elevate children’s risk for chronic diseases, particularly 
among children from under-resourced populations. While behavioral sleep interventions have been 
effective at elongating children’s sleep, existing studies are limited because they rarely include lowincome 
families and typically focus more on the treatment of diagnosed sleep conditions. Insufficient 
attention to diversity perpetuates sleep disparities by not providing cogent support to families who 
may benefit most. Thus, interventions aimed at prevention need to address salient challenges 
experienced by low-income populations and incorporate modifiable strategies to improve unique 
barriers and needs. The goal of this project is to contribute to improvements in children’s sleep by 
pilot testing and strengthening “Sleep Tight” – a behavioral sleep intervention aimed at meeting the 
needs of families experiencing economic disadvantage. This project uses a community-engaged 
approach with parents and key stakeholders to understand and address modifiable barriers to 
creating optimal child sleep habits. Intervention content is designed to capitalize on community 
strengths and overcome distinct barriers to ensure maximum relevance. Using a pilot randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) design, families (N=60) are randomized to the intervention (n=30) or wait-list 
control (n=30) group. Intervention content is delivered by an interventionist via virtual, one-on-one 
sessions with each primary caregiver. Both groups are assessed at pre- and post-, and then the 
intervention group is also assessed at follow-up, while the wait-list control group can participate in the 
Sleep Tight intervention. The primary focus of the pilot RCT is to assess intervention feasibility via 
recruitment, retention, attendance, and acceptability metrics. The secondary goal is to assess the 
preliminary efficacy on intervention changes in children’s nighttime sleep duration using actigraphy to 
inform a future large-scale RCT. Furthermore, given links between child sleep, social-emotional 
functioning (e.g., problem behaviors), and obesity-related behaviors (e.g., diet, screen time, physical 
activity), interventions to improve child sleep have the potential to improve physical and socialemotional 
well-being, without directly intervening on these domains (i.e., cascading effects). As such, 
this project includes an exploratory aim to assess potential cascading effects on children’s socialemotional 
well-being and obesogenic behaviors as indicators on changes in these domains. Results 
of this study will contribute to the long-term goal of producing a behavioral sleep intervention that 
improves child sleep and impacts obesogenic behaviors and social-emotional well-being. Ultimately, 
this work seeks to reduce child sleep disparities for families with low-income, to promote both 
physical health and social-emotional development."

The goal of this project is to understand how two virulence factors from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), CpsA
and phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), impair immunity by undermining both classical and non-classical
autophagy. Mtb is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), the leading cause of death worldwide from a bacterial
infection. The main cellular niche for Mtb is macrophages and neutrophils, the very immune cells that are meant
to clear infection. How Mtb survives the innate immune response to establish infection is not well understood. In
the previous project period, we discovered that an exported protein, CpsA, is critically important for Mtb virulence.
We showed that CpsA inhibits phagosomal recruitment of the NADPH oxidase. The NADPH oxidase makes
reactive oxygen species (ROS), an important mediator of the innate immune response. In addition to its direct
antimicrobial activity, ROS is required for a lysosomal trafficking pathway called LC3-associated phagocytosis
(LAP), a non-classical form of autophagy. Thus, by inhibiting ROS, CpsA also inhibits LAP. We showed both in
macrophages and mice that CpsA protects Mtb from the NADPH oxidase and LAP. Interestingly, CpsA physically
interacts NDP52 and TAX1BP1, autophagy adaptors that function in a form of classical autophagy (xenophagy),
suggesting that CpsA may also impair xenophagy. Moreover, we found that the Mtb virulence lipid, PDIM, also
inhibits the NADPH oxidase. Previous studies proposed an array of roles for PDIM and showed that it protects
Mtb from a poorly defined innate killing mechanism. Our data suggest that an unappreciated virulence property
of PDIM is blocking the NADPH oxidase and LAP. Thus, we hypothesize that CpsA inhibits xenophagy and
works in concert with PDIM to inhibit the NADPH oxidase and LAP. Further, we propose that the infectious dose
of Mtb depends upon its ability to evade these innate defenses in myeloid cells that are recruited to the lungs
during initial infection. Here, we will define how CpsA inhibits the NADPH oxidase and investigate whether it also
impairs xenophagy by blocking NDP52 and TAX1BP1 function. We will determine whether PDIM also impairs
recruitment of the NADPH oxidase to mycobacterial phagosomes and evaluate the contribution that PDIM plays
towards subverting the NADPH oxidase and LAP in vivo. To determine whether CpsA promotes the
establishment of infection, we will use an ultra-low dose infection model in mice. Using conditional knockout
(cKO) mice, we will determine in which cells CpsA functions to inhibit the NADPH oxidase and LAP during acute
and chronic infection. Our findings will provide mechanistic insight into how two key virulence factors in Mtb
collaborate to undermine immunity. Our studies will reveal a cell type-specific virulence strategy of the bacilli,
delineate the cell types that participate in LAP in vivo, and define host-pathogen interactions that govern the
establishment of infection. Our studies will provide detailed mechanistic insight into the immune evasion
strategies of one of the world's most formidable pathogens. By elucidating the mechanism of action of two crucial
virulence factors in Mtb, we will advance innovative approaches to prevent and treat TB."

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition affecting >10% of the adult population and 2-3%
of children in the USA. OSA is considered as an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
and lung disorders but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. In particular, the role of
intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHC, the integral components of OSA) in inducing or promoting
cardiovascular conditions remains obscure. Recent advances in sequencing technology and microbial and
metabolomic bioinformatics have shed light on an important relation between the gut microbiome and
cardiovascular diseases. Since OSA is a critical risk factor for these disorders, and our preliminary studies
have demonstrated that IHC alters the ecology of gut microbiome and have a strong impact on metabolism, we
hypothesize that IHC induces specific alterations in the gut microbiome and microbial-derived metabolites, and
these changes causally promote atherosclerosis. Indeed, we have obtained strong candidate microbial families
and metabolites that can affect vascular integrity under IHC. For example, we have found that a) IHC
accelerates the formation of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice; b) IHC changes the gut microbiome ecology of
families such as Verrucomicrobiaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae; and c) IHC alters
microbial-derived metabolites (such as bile salts (BAs)). In the current application, we focus on these
microbiota and metabolite candidates to investigate their role in atherosclerosis. First, we will isolate specific
gut microbial strains that were altered by IHC treatment and determine the role of these specific microbial
strain(s) in the development of cardiovascular disease in vivo using germ-free ApoE-/- mice that were currently
created and established in our laboratory. Second, we will delineate the role of the major bile acid receptors
(i.e., FXR and TGR5) in mediating the effect of candidate bile acids in IHC-induced cardiovascular disease in
vivo using ApoE-/-/FXR-/- and ApoE-/-/TGR5-/- double knockout mice strains as well as the mice strains carrying
cell specific conditional deletion of FXR and TGR5 on ApoE-/- background. And third, we will dissect the
mechanisms underlying the role of specific IHC-altered bile acids (i.e., TβMCA and UDCA) in IHC-induced
macrophage foam cell formation in vitro using primary cell cultures that are derived from mice with ApoE-/-
/FXR-/- and ApoE-/-/TGR5-/- double deletion. This project will delineate novel mechanisms regulating OSA-
induced cardiovascular disease and provide potential novel targets and strategies to improve treatment or
prevent disease."

quantified marginal bone loss (MBL) around dental implants and risk of implant failure.” The primary outcome of
this study is quantification of the prognostic ability of inflammatory markers in saliva for marginal bone loss

This proposal builds on decades of evidence supporting a crucial role for mitochondrial dysfunction and
inflammation in neurodegenerative disease. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the potential of mitochondrial
stress signals as predictive biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. Our working hypothesis is that
collective pressure from genetic and environmental risk factors impinges on mitochondrial homeostasis, inducing
the release of immunogenic stress signals that drive the aging brain into a pro-inflammatory state. If these stress
signals are not resolved, at-risk subjects will have a persistent elevation of oxidative stress that is above the
threshold for neurodegeneration, ultimately leading to the clinical manifestation of PD. To date, the earliest and
most established mitochondrial stress signal in PD is reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. One of the key
signaling functions of mitochondrial ROS is to alert the cellular environment of impending bioenergetic stress.
Mitochondrial ROS directly activate microglia, and boost the immunogenicity of other mitochondrial damage
associated patterns (mtDAMPs) and α-synuclein in the at-risk PD brain. The primary ROS produced by stressed
mitochondria and activated microglia is superoxide (O2*-). Thus, O2*- provides a signal of mitochondrial and
immune (mito-immune) stress. We will determine if this mito-immune signal is a critical driver of PD using the
first blood-brain barrier permeant, O2*- selective PET probe to track PD progression in vivo from the key
prodromal features to the end stages in distinct animal models. Our preliminary results support the hypothesis
that at-risk PD subjects have increased basal levels of oxidative stress that are 1) detectable by [18F]ROStrace,
2) correlate with PD progression, and 3) sensitize transgenic animals to toxins associated with PD. We now
propose to validate these findings in established PD mouse models with prodromal features specifically related
to mito-immune stress and α-synuclein pathology. The progression of the prodromal features will be monitored
by changes in dopaminergic signaling via PET/MRI, sleep-wake dynamics, and behavioral tests of mood,
olfaction, cognition, and autonomic function, prior to motor impairment caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons.
This approach will allow us to investigate the role of mito-immune signaling in conditions mimicking the
complexity of PD pathogenesis in the majority of late-onset patients. Our multi-tiered, highly translatable strategy
is designed to ensure direct application of this research to the clinic."

Attacks of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD) can render a patient blind,
paralyzed or comatose and distinguishing it from other demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS)
and aquaporin-4(AQP4)-IgG positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is crucial given the
major differences in clinical course, treatment and prognosis. Major knowledge gaps in MOGAD are hindering
patient care and a barrier to understanding its pathogenesis. The absence of MOGAD incidence and
prevalence data and limited knowledge on its epidemiology worldwide directly impacts decisions on when to
order MOG-IgG, healthcare planning, clinical trial design and identification of risk factors. The lack of
prospective USA data regarding the prognostic value of MOG-IgG titer and persistence impacts treatment
decisions. MOG-IgG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is used by clinicians to diagnose MOGAD, yet data on its
diagnostic utility is limited compared to the established utility of serum MOG-IgG. The limited data on MRI
evolution and immuno-pathology hinders our understanding of MOGAD pathogenesis. The long-term goal is to
better diagnose, treat, and understand MOGAD. The objective of this proposal is to determine the incidence
and prevalence of MOGAD, the prognostic value of MOG-IgG testing, the diagnostic utility of CSF MOG-IgG,
the evolution of MRI lesions and the immunopathology. The central hypotheses (supported by the applicants
preliminary data) is that MOGAD epidemiology is similar to AQP4-IgG in the USA but varies by region, that
serum MOG-IgG persistence and high titer predict relapse, that CSF MOG-IgG lacks diagnostic utility, that
MOGAD MRI lesions resolve more often than MS and that immuno-pathological characteristics of MOGAD can
be defined. The rationale is that these findings will directly impact patient care, facilitate clinical trial readiness,
enhance understanding of pathogenesis, and lead to development of novel treatments. The hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To determine the population-based incidence, prevalence and
frequency of MOGAD versus AQP4-IgG and MS across multiple world regions; 2) To identify the prognostic
value of MOG-IgG titer and persistence, assess the utility of CSF MOG-IgG and compare MRI evolution to MS
and AQP4-IgG NMOSD; 3) To define the immuno-pathology of MOGAD and compare it to MS and AQP4-IgG
NMOSD. To do this we will utilize the largest clinical, sero-epidemiologic and pathologic biobank of
demyelinating disease in the world. The approach is innovative because it uses a novel live-cell flow cytometry
based MOG-IgG assay developed by the team of applicants. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to guide resource allocation, directly impact patient care by providing guidance on diagnostics and
therapeutics and give insight into pathogenesis. Ultimately, the knowledge of immunopathology may lead to
the development of novel treatments similar to how complement deposition in AQP4-IgG NMOSD pathology
led to phase 2 and 3 trials showing efficacy and safety of eculizumab (a complement inhibitor)."

timely identification of at-risk infants and specific pathologic IH patterns for future trials of targeted intervention.
Extremely premature birth and various postnatal factors can negatively affect outcome. In a significant proportion
of extremely premature infants the sequelae persist beyond infancy with relatively high rates of asthma and sleep
disordered breathing (SDB) in childhood and worrisome prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI).
This multicenter proposal will systematically and innovatively examine the interaction between IH during neonatal
intensive care and these sequelae by means of detailed clinical phenotyping and advanced analytics. The
proposed investigation will provide personalized prognosis and identification of infants at risk of poor long-term
outcome that could transform clinical care and uncover targets for preventive or therapeutic strategies.
The main goal of this proposal is to build prognostic models of asthma, SDB, and NDI at pre-school age in former
extremely premature infants based on physiologic waveforms and clinical characteristics in the neonatal

10908742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to identify high-efficacy and actionable strategies to improve perinatal healthcare utilization
and perinatal healthcare quality (perinatal care utilization and quality; PCUQ) and reduce maternal morbidity (MM) rates
and disparities experienced by for American Indian (AI) and low socioeconomic status women within a Northern Plains
area. High rates of MM and disproportionate burden of MM experienced by marginalized groups has resulted in a wide
range of recommendations to improve maternal health. Many recommendations focus on reducing barriers and
enhancing facilitators (B/F) that will increase utilization of perinatal care or will improve the quality of perinatal care
provided. However, there is little understanding of which B/F have the strongest impact on PCUQ and are therefore the
most effective targets to improve PCUQ across the spectrum of person/patient, provider/health system and policy
levels. This understanding is critical for actions that will reduce MM, as the association between PCUQ and MM is still
unclear. Recommendations also rarely account the unique contexts of both cultural strengths as facilitators and
systemic/structural racism as barriers experienced by AI communities, or contexts that impact the feasibility and success
of implementing specific changes. To address these issues, this project involves building a community-based system
dynamics simulation model that will detail the PCUQ B/F on person/patient, provider/health system and policy levels
driving low PCUQ rates and disparities for AI and low socioeconomic status women (Aim 1). Models will be developed
using a community-based participatory approach in collaboration with stakeholders who have personal and professional
experience in the multiple components of PCUQ. This model will be simulated, and community-informed hypotheses will
be tested to identify which B/F should be targeted as the best strategies for improving PCUQ and reducing disparity.
Simulation models will be created in part with survey data from 380 women (65% AI) who live within the target
communities and have had recent pregnancy and/or childbirth experience. This data will also be used to estimate path
models that will evaluate PCUQ B/F as indirect effects on MM (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop qualitative community-
based system dynamics models detailing the process of mechanisms that drive decision making and implementing
actions for changes to perinatal healthcare practice and policy and the role of research during these processes (Aim 3).
Models will be developed in collaboration with a sample of health system and policy decisionmakers and stakeholders,
and with a sample of grassroots advocates for AI health and health equity to further evaluate equity or inequity within
decision making and change processes. Key mechanisms for change and equity will be identified through network-based
analysis of the qualitative model. The three studies detailed within this project will cumulatively critical information to
improve maternal health and health equity for AI and low socioeconomic status women in a high need region, as well as
a clear pathway for how this information should be utilized to implement the action plan that will be developed using
project findings in collaboration with community stakeholders and collaborators."

Ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure are the leading causes of combined morbidity and mortality in
humans. Herein, sarcomere dysfunction has a central role in disease pathogenesis. The sarcomere is the
essential functional unit of cardiac muscle, directly responsible for the pumping action of the heart. The cardiac
sarcomere is a multimeric contractile apparatus consisting of a thin myofilament-based allosteric regulatory
complex together with the myosin-based thick myofilament that generates force. Interlacing myofilaments
operate in synchrony to regulate and generate the forces necessary for heart performance. Beat-to-beat control
of cardiac sarcomere activation refers to the status of the thin filament regulatory system in controlling the degree
to which contraction is turned on and off during a twitch. Disruption in sarcomere function underlies the basis for
numerous forms of acquired and inherited heart diseases affecting millions of people in this country. Thus, focus
here on mechanistic insights into sarcomere regulation underscores the major health relevance of this proposal.
Recently, emerging results have come to the fore positing synergistic inter-myofilament regulatory signaling
mechanisms, including a new role of myosin cross-bridge ON/OFF states in controlling muscle contraction.
Building on our sarcomere activation innovations featuring single unloaded cardiac myocytes, we have made a
breakthrough methodological advance, permitting real-time recordings of sarcomere activation in intact cardiac
muscle under physiological load. This system is capable of detecting, by intramolecular FRET, multiple
myofilament activating ligands during the physiological time course of a single twitch contraction in intact cardiac
muscle under load. Guiding hypothesis: During physiologically relevant twitch contractions under load, thin
filament activation is controlled dynamically by multiple synergistic inter-myofilament regulatory inputs, including
TnC bound Ca2+, TnI switch domain-TnC interaction, OFF to ON state myosin cross-bridges, and MyBP-C in live
cardiac muscle. This proposal aims to investigate inter-myofilament signaling by altering the TnI molecular switch
mechanism during the physiological time-course of a single cardiac twitch in live cardiac muscles under load; to
investigate the mechanism of inter-myofilament signaling during the cardiac twitch contraction in live intact
cardiac muscles by modification in myosin cross-bridges; and to investigate the role MyBP-C in inter-myofilament
signaling during physiological twitch contractions in intact cardiac muscles. Enabled by our innovative approach,
the new insights into inter-myofilament signaling mechanisms gained here will significantly impact our
understanding of cardiac function. In turn, this provides the essential foundation to guide new therapeutic
discovery for the diseased heart by leveraging the sarcomere as an excellent target for developing new
treatments and therapies for the diseased heart."

between TUKSoD, CPH and the Medical School for faculty and student training, and overall research support
for the execution of Component 4 of this proposal. Our proposed project was collaboratively developed by
individuals with backgrounds in Periodontology, General and Oral Epidemiology, Oral Microbiome, Health
Informatics, Biostatistics and Public Health, and Physicians who will assist in extracting medical metrics relevant
to management of periodontal diseases (PD) from real-time medical records in the Pennsylvania Health Share

faculty-student mentoring partnerships to conduct small-scale research projects. Finally, in Component 4, we
will develop longitudinal predictive models of PD incidence and progression using machine learning approaches
and microbiome/metagenomic sequencing strategies. This component has the following aims: Aim1 seeks to
develop clinical decision tools that utilize matched medical-dental patient datasets from TUKSoD and the PA
HSX EHR records. Aim1a will focus on developing a Medical Continuity of Care Record (CCR) that will provide
patients' up-to-date medical health metrics that can be used in the provision of care at the dental school. Using
dental patient's matched records, Aim1b will build an AI Empowered Prediction Model for PD. Aim2 will build
on findings from Aim1b to assess the potential of the subgingival and salivary microbiomes as additional
predictors of PD incidence and progression. Aim 2a will validate a dysbiosis index, applied to both subgingival
plaque and saliva samples, as a predictor of PD in a cohort study, while Aim2b will identify potential high
resolution, salivary/plaque metagenomic biomarkers of PD progression via a nested case-control study. The
proposed application builds on prior research conducted at TUKSoD and is directed towards increasing
participation of clinically-oriented faculty and pre/postdoctoral dental students in the school's research activities,
coupled with training in Applied Clinical Research including health informatics, opening a new pathway to further
research in dental education as well as promote faculty professional development, expand the research
academic workforce, and provide opportunities to conduct student-mentored practice-based research."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a major cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide and HIV+ individuals are particularly susceptible. The only licensed TB vaccine is the live
attenuated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) that is given intradermally to infants. While BCG provides substantial
protection against non-pulmonary TB in childhood, it has little impact on pulmonary TB rates in adults. Recent
studies in macaques have elicited striking protection from TB by instead delivering BCG intravenously or
mucosally. However, BCG can cause disease in immunosuppressed recipients, including HIV+ children.
Recently, a more attenuated BCG strain, BCG𝚫1419c, has been shown to be safe in athymic mice,
immunogenic in both mice and guinea pigs, and more efficacious than BCG in both murine and guinea pigs
models of TB. In this proposal, we will use our pediatric Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model of TB to
test both BCG and BCG𝚫1419c when given by the more clinically translatable mucosal route. Using MCM 1-2
years of age more closely resembles the pediatric population currently targeted for BCG vaccination. We will
characterize the immunogenicity of BCG and BCG𝚫1419c in these young MCM using a suite of powerful assays,
including multiparameter flow cytometry, single cell RNAseq, serology, and epigenetic analysis. We will
determine the protective efficacy of these vaccines by challenging the animals with virulent Mtb and then
assessing protection using our well-established and quantitative PET/CT imaging, pathology, and Mtb burden
measures. In Aim 2, we will use a similar approach to define the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy
of both BCG and BCG𝚫1419c in SIV+ juvenile MCM, modeling HIV+ children who could most benefit from an
improved TB vaccine.
We will test our hypothesis that this more attenuated BCG𝚫1419c will be safe, immunogenic, and protect from
Mtb when administered mucosally to juvenile MCM with and without pre-existing SIV infection. This multi-PI
proposal assembles a team of three established scientists with complimentary expertise in the fields of TB, HIV
and SIV, immunology, and pediatric infectious diseases. Furthermore, we already have an established
productive and collaborative relationship, ensuring successful completion of this important project."

The goal of the Baylor College of Medicine Short-Term Research Education Program to Enhance
Diversity in Health-Related Research (BCM STREPED) is to mentor undergraduate students
underrepresented in science and medicine (UR) in research-intensive biomedical training in mission
areas of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The BCM Graduate School of
Biomedical Sciences is supportive and proud of all the accomplishments of the BCM STREPED alumni
since the initial NHLBI funding by a T35 (Pl, Dr. Gayle Slaughter) in 1995 and in 2011 by this R25 (PD,
Gayle Slaughter, and Co-I, Aladin Boriek). These NHLBl-funded programs have trained 199
undergraduates, with 86 percent of the alumni still involved in academia or careers in NHLBI mission-related
fields. They are contributing to the diversity of the US biomedical workforce to decrease
morbidity, mortality, and improving the health of the diverse US population. This BCM STREPED R25
grant renewal proposes to recruit, mentor, and train 60 (12/year) UR undergraduates, chosen from a
nationwide pool of more than 500 applicants annually, who will spend 9-weeks in the BCM Summer
Undergraduate Research Training (SMART) program performing NHLBI mission area research. The
curriculum and training include mentored, original NHLBl-mission research, attendance at daily
research seminars led by diverse faculty, development of science writing and oral presentation skills,
evaluation of the scientific and medical literature, developing critical thinking and evaluation, receiving
responsible conduct of research training, and the principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility. BCM
STREPED trainees will build knowledge and questions in foundational science and clinical and
translational research in the NHLBl-mission areas. Other activities include mentorship and training in
communication skills, fostering confidence and independence, learning about Ph.D., MD, MD/Ph.D.,
and health professional programs, participation at a BCM School Night to interact with medical, health
professions, and graduate schools' leadership and students, discussions with UR physicians/scientists,
and volunteering at Baylor-affiliated hospitals. Students will receive personalized career counseling and
how to serve as role models for UR colleagues and help educate the broader communities about NHLBI

To improve patient outcomes, BioAesthetics is developing a drug-eluting acellular dermal graft for
 single-stage reconstruction of full-thickness burns.
Nearly half a million Americans are affected each year by burns requiring medical treatment, with nearly 40,000
patients needing to be hospitalized. The annual medical cost of burns is $1.5 billion. Burn wounds have a long-
lasting impact on health-related quality of life and affect both physical and mental health. Infections are the most
frequent wound healing complication, with up to a third of patients with burns developing infections, and are the
leading cause of death.
Our innovation lies in creating a transformative acellular biologic graft (ABG) that enables sustained, local release
of therapeutic agents at the burn site. Our novel approach simultaneously provides a native dermal scaffold for
patient-mediated tissue regeneration, while countering the onset of complications due to infection during the
course of wound healing. Donor tissue processed with BioAesthetics’ patent-pending method to remove cells
and immunogens (i.e., ABGs) have been show to support host-mediated tissue recellularization. To create ABGs
that enable therapeutic agent release, BioAesthetics has developed a patent-pending polymer impregnation
technique that generates hydrogel-based drug delivery systems within ABGs.
In our Phase I project, BioAesthetics assessed the feasibility of this innovative product for treating third-degree
burns and demonstrated that the ABGs are efficacious in porcine third-degree burn wound healing and infection
barrier models. In this Phase II project, we propose further product development, related to clinical manufacturing
of the graft, including evaluating donor tissue variability and terminal sterilization effects, and expansion of the
preclinical testing to include porcine third-degree burn infected and uninfected wound healing and barrier function
models. Following completion of these studies, the product will be poised for FDA regulatory filings. Ultimately,
our goal is to improve clinical outcomes for patients by reducing complications that arise from burn wounds."

 There are approximately 43.5 million informal (unpaid) caregivers in the U.S., of which 5.6 million are
African American.1 Almost one third of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) report receiving care from
informal caregivers, typically friends and family.2 Informal caregivers often provide a variety of support to
PLWHA, including emotional and instrumental, financial assistance, and health advice.3-5 African American
caregivers of PLWHA have unique needs because they are more likely to experience stressors related to
intersecting sources of stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS and race18,19 and a lack of access to
culturally sensitive health care providers and services,20-22 placing them at higher risk for burnout and adverse
health outcomes for themselves and their care recipients.23 Thus, while informal caregivers play a critical role
in supporting PLWHA, such caregiving can take a tremendous toll. Preventing or reducing caregiver stress is
especially important in order to sustain informal caregiving and its myriad benefits for patients’ quality of life
and health outcomes.
 Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is one type of intervention that has shown promise in helping
caregivers manage stress while subsequently enhancing their mental health and well-being.9 MBSR consists
of psychoeducation focused on stress reduction and the development of an accepting and non-judgmental
attitude toward daily stressors of living.11 MBSR interventions can include activities such as guided meditations
and yoga exercises designed to help individuals build awareness of the present moment, and decrease
reactivity to stress.10-12,40
 Building upon prior research regarding MBSR interventions, during Phase I, we successfully developed a
prototype mobile application (app) for caregivers entitled Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for African
American Caregivers (MBSR-AAC). Based on the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework,24 components
of the app focus on decreasing stress associated with intersecting sources of stigma, discrimination, and
caregiving burdens specifically associated with caregiving for PLWHA. In the present Phase II SBIR study, we
will build on Phase I findings to incorporate research-driven enhancements to the app, conduct a feasibility trial
of the enhanced app, and conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of the app in
reducing caregiver stress. If proven to be effective, the MBSR-AAC app could have a positive impact on the
well-being of African American caregivers that serve as a critical pillar of support for many PLWHA."

 The zebrafish is an invaluable tool for developing and screening human therapeutics and modeling human
diseases. This animal model is strikingly genetically similar to humans, sharing 70% of all human genes (by
comparison, mice have orthologs of ~80% of human genes), and 82-90% of human disease-associated genes.
 Currently, however, zebrafish facilities lack an affordable, precise way to monitor and track the health of
their fish stock in an automated way, and to correlate fish health with extrinsic factors that may affect it. As a
result, research using unhealthy fish may lead to irreproducibility in research and spurious conclusions,
ultimately wasting time, money, and scientific effort. We propose the creation of a zebrafish health monitoring
system, “FishCam,” which has the potential to automate wellness checks and track them along with
environmental data (e.g., water quality) and, thus, revolutionize fish husbandry in aquaculture and zebrafish
laboratories. In Phase 1 Aim 1, we will build a system that reliably captures images and video of a zebrafish
population. In Phase 1 Aim 2, we will develop software algorithms that extract parameters such as how many
fish are in each tank, their size and their activity levels over the previous 48 hours. In Phase 2 Aim 1, we will
extend the FishCam imaging and analysis system to be compatible with commercial zebrafish rack and tank
systems (“FishCam Smart Rack”). Finally, in Phase 2 Aim 2, we will perform beta testing of the FishCam Smart
Rack system, optimizing it for real-world installations at external sites in the United States.
 Achievement of these aims will produce an automated, standardized system for zebrafish health
monitoring which will reduce variability and help ensure scientific validity of zebrafish research. By advancing
zebrafish husbandry, the proposed project aims to facilitate greater insights into human diseases and
streamline the development of human therapeutics."

10914660,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) is experienced by about half of people living with HIV (PWH),
and presents as a spectrum of neurocognitive impairments. While the majority of PWH in the United States are
virally suppressed or undetectable, the overall proportion of PWH with HAND symptoms has remained
unchanged. One of the hallmarks of HAND is the atrophy of white matter, a pathology that persists in HAND
patients treated with ART. The duration of ART treatment in PWH has been shown to correlate to the observed
loss of white matter, leading to the concern that the drugs themselves are causing this pathology. The attenuation
of white matter is associated with a loss of myelin, which in the CNS is produced by oligodendrocytes (OLs).
Myelin is necessary for saltatory conduction and trophic support of axons and its loss may contribute to the
clinical changes seen in HAND. Previous work from our lab has demonstrated that select ART drugs prevent the
maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelination, though the mechanisms underlying these observations require
additional investigation. We have further shown that treating maturing OLs with select ART drugs, such as
Elvitegravir (EVG), activates the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), and inhibition of the ISR restores OL
differentiation in the presence of EVG. The ISR is an adaptive pathway used to restore homeostasis in eukaryotic
cells under stressful conditions, and is sometimes characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules
(SGs), membraneless organelles thought to aid in the global inhibition of translation. Stress granules have not
yet been extensively studied in oligodendrocytes, but research of other neurodegenerative diseases has found
that their presence in neurons may cause acceleration of neurodegeneration. During chronic stress, SGs can
become persistent, and the long-term aggregation of mRNAs and proteins can become pathological. There is
strong evidence associating chronic SG accumulation in neurons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
Alzheimer’s, and frontotemporal dementia. Our lab has also observed SGs in post-mortem white matter of HIV+
patients with neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, my preliminary data has shown that maturing OLs treated
with EVG not only activate the ISR, but also form SGs that disappear with ISR inhibition. I hypothesize that during
ARV drug treatment, stress granules sequester mRNAs needed for maturation of OLs via PERK activation of
the ISR, and that these granules form to prevent cell death. I will test this hypothesis via three specific aims. AIM
1: I will determine if ARV Drug induced stress granules in OLs form via the PERK activated ISR. AIM 2: I will
determine the contribution of SG formation to OL survival during ARV drug exposure. AIM 3: I will determine
whether ARV-induced SGs in OLs sequester mRNAs needed for maturation and myelination. Since stress
granules have not previously been characterized in oligodendrocytes, this work will not only provide insight into
improving outcomes of ART treated PWH, but will also benefit research of other neurological diseases
characterized by loss of white matter."
10763439,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults; however, much of this blindness
occurs in the later phases of the disease due to proliferative disease or macular edema. Recently, the role of
inflammation has become a focus of potential therapies targeted to treat earlier stages and/or prevent
progression of the disease. While it is clear that a large number of cytokines/chemokines are increased in the
diabetic retina, the role of innate immunity has only recently been investigated. Recent work has
demonstrated that toll-like receptors (TLRs) are altered in diabetes. Work has also shown that TLR4 is
increased in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic retina. Additionally, TLR4 may have actions in retinal
endothelial cells (REC), as both TLR2/4 pathways are active in these retinal cells. Our preliminary data has
expanded on those findings to demonstrate that β-adrenergic receptors can decrease TLR4 signaling in the
diabetic mouse retina, as well as in both REC and retinal Müller cells. Supporting our findings in retina,
studies in macrophages also demonstrate that β-adrenergic receptors can regulate TLR4. The response to
Compound 49b was blocked when Epac1 or PKA were knocked down by siRNA, suggesting these proteins act
as damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) regulating TLR4 signaling in the diabetic retina.
Our primary hypothesis for this proposal is that PKA and Epac1 can regulate TLR4 and may represent a key
pathway that controls retina damage in diabetes. Our overall goal is to better understand the role of
downstream mediators of β-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of TLR4 signaling in the diabetic retina,
with the intent of identifying key pathways in innate immunity that can be targeted for novel therapeutics.

10747298,"Parturition in humans is thought to be a uterus-intrinsic process since it occurs without a decline in the serum
progesterone (P4) levels. However, this process remains mysterious: not only is the nature of the “clock” that times gestation length completely obscure, but little is known about the sequence of cellular and molecular events initiated at term gestation that ultimately culminate in uterine contraction. Unfortunately, uterus-intrinsic parturition pathways have not been dissected mechanistically, as studies performed in mice and rats have instead addressed these species' superimposed, endocrine-mediated parturition pathway that involves shutdown of P4 synthesis by the ovary (i.e. luteolysis). This leaves a fundamental gap in knowledge with profound negative implications for human health since it precludes attempts to develop rational therapies for preterm birth, a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Here, we address how parturition is controlled by the IL-1 cytokine family member IL-33 and its key target cell type, the group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2). Strikingly, we have found that IL-33 deficient mice as well as Rag2-/- Il2rg-/- mice lacking all lymphocytes including ILC2s are unable to initiate parturition when they are supplemented with exogenous P4 to circumvent the impact of luteolysis. In contrast, P4-treated Rag2-/- mice lacking T and B cells but retaining innate lymphoid cells undergo parturition with comparable timing to B6 controls. We have also found that ILC2s expand in the myometrium with advancing gestation in an IL-33-dependent fashion, and that IL-33 is produced within the late gestation uterus primarily by its stromal constituents. Together, these results suggest that ILC2 activation within the myometrium, initiated in late gestation by IL-33 produced by uterine stromal cells, is a key component of the uterus-intrinsic pathway of parturition in mice. We propose to substantiate this hypothesis with the ultimate goal of understanding how the IL-33/ILC2 axis might be involved in normal human parturition and the pathophysiology of preterm birth. The proposal has three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use mice with various uterus- and cell type-specific defects in the IL-33/ST2 axis to delineate the exact cellular and temporal requirements for IL-33 and ILC2s in parturition. Aim 2 will then identify the effector mechanisms through which IL-33 promotes parturition by first evaluating known parturition components and potential candidate pathways suggested by our preliminary data, and then by taking unbiased approaches to reveal additional downstream candidates. Aim 3 will then evaluate whether the IL-33/ILC2 axis is involved in the pathophysiology of preterm parturition in mice and, by analyzing archived hysterectomy specimens, in term and preterm parturition in humans. Together, we expect these studies to provide clear cellular and molecular definition to a key, uterus-intrinsic regulatory circuit that drives parturition in mice. As such, they might open up new avenues for dissecting the mechanisms of human parturition and for determining how such mechanisms are dysregulated in disorders of human pregnancy."
10747310,"We propose to add the measurement of muscle mass to an already funded program project
grant. Rapid declines in physical functioning often occur after the diagnosis of cancer,
especially among older cancer survivors; however, a handful of diet and exercise interventions
have been found to ameliorate these losses. The contribution of muscle mass and changes in
muscle mass in older men and women, particularly those who have survived cancer is not well
characterized, partly due to the inability to directly and accurately quantify skeletal muscle mass
and reliance on assessments of lean mass as a surrogate. The Adapting MultiPLe behavior
Interventions that eFfectively Improve (AMPLIFI) Cancer Survivor Health (1P01CA22997)
is aimed at testing three distinct lifestyle interventions among 652 older, inactive, overweight or
obese cancer survivors, a large proportion of whom will be minority and rural. The interventions
include: 1) a 6-month dietary intervention aimed at improving diet quality and weight loss, as
well as preserving lean body mass; 2) a 6-month intervention that is aimed at promoting
aerobic physical activity; and 3) a 12-month diet and exercise intervention that combines both
diet and exercise simultaneously (and effects will be evaluated against the combination of
interventions 1 and 2 in sequence). Visiting nurses will assess physical function and perform
phlebotomy at home health assessments scheduled at baseline and every six months;
participants also will complete surveys that assess diet, physical activity and overall quality of
life. We propose to measure the effects of these interventions on muscle mass using
the novel D3-creatine (D3Cr) dilution method. We have demonstrated that this non-
invasive method can be implemented in a large cohort study (MrOS) and that D3Cr muscle
mass is strongly associated with functional capacity and risk of disability and that age-
associated decreases in muscle mass are associated with slower gait speed and decreased
strength. These associations were not observed using DXA derived lean mass. Subjects will
ingest a 60 mg capsule of D3Cr and produce a fasting urine sample 48 – 96 hours later for
the assessment of D3-Creatinine enrichment to determine creatine pool size and, because
98% of total body creatine is found in muscle, muscle mass. For the first time, the
relationship between changes in muscle mass resulting from exercise and weight loss and
functional capacity and physical activity will be assessed in this at-risk population of older
cancer survivors."
10747316,"Physical inactivity is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is now considered
the leading cause of premature death (Blair, 2009). Rates of physical inactivity continue to increase along with
health care costs to treat CVD. Despite these disturbing trends, the mechanisms by which a sedentary lifestyle
leads to CVD are not fully known. CVD is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and
overactivity of a brainstem region known as the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (Sved et al.,
2003;Guyenet, 2006). Sympathoexcitatory responses to direct activation of the RVLM are enhanced in
sedentary versus physically active animals (Mischel and Mueller, 2011) and are associated with changes in
dendritic branching (Mischel et al., 2014). These data suggest that a sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the
development of CVD by increased sensitivity of RVLM neurons. Our long term goal is to understand the central
sympathetic mechanisms by which physical inactivity contributes to the development of CVD. This is an
important clinical, economic and public health care problem. The overall objective of this application is to define
the mechanisms by which physical inactivity increases, and physical activity prevents over-activation of
presympathetic neurons in the RVLM. Our central hypothesis is that sedentary and hypertensive conditions
each enhance glutamatergic signaling, initiate BDNF-dependent mechanisms and further propagate enhanced
glutamatergic signaling; such that in combination, produce clinically relevant increases in sympathetic outflow
and blood pressure. This project is expected to shift current paradigms regarding the mechanisms by which
physical inactivity and pro-hypertensive stimuli combine to increase sympathetic activity and exaggerate the
hypertensive phenotype. We will test our central hypothesis in distinct but interrelated aims using our well-
established models of sedentary or active conditions and 2K-1C hypertension with sham-operated rats as
controls. Aim 1: Utilize in vivo gene targeting to determine the contribution of BDNF-TrkB signaling in sedentary
and 2K1C mediated neuroplasticity in the RVLM. Aim 2: Establish relationships between BDNF and synaptic
plasticity-associated mRNA and protein expression in the RVLM of sedentary versus active, normotensive and
2K1C rats using laser capture microdissection of presympathetic RVLM neurons and tract-tracing, triple-
immunofluorescent labeling. Aim 3: Quantify glutamatergic tone and neuronal activity in the RVLM of sedentary
versus active, normotensive or 2K1C rats using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the RVLM. Our studies combine state-of-the art techniques with conceptually
innovative hypotheses to fill significant knowledge gaps towards understanding two fundamentally important
and intertwined, yet unresolved health problems, i.e. physical inactivity and hypertension."
10747330,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Huntington’s disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutational
expansion in a CAG repeat tract in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, termed mHTT, is characterized by abnormal
involuntary movements, a severe mental decline, and emotional changes including irritability and depression.
The symptoms primarily occur during prime working years (ages of 30 to 50), and there is currently no
treatment to delay onset or progression. Resilience to HD, a phenomenon whereby motor and cognitive
functioning is better than predicted based on genotype, is due in part to as-yet-unidentified genetic factors.
These factors may provide key targets for treatment and prevention of HD and other age-related
neurodegenerative diseases. However, significant barriers limit discovery of the mechanisms of resilience
using human genetic methods alone because highly resilient individuals are rare, and asymptomatic carriers
may escape attention or be misclassified by neurologists. Further, it is not possible to conduct longitudinal
molecular analyses on human brain tissues. Animal models of HD provide a more tractable opportunity for
discovery and characterization of resilience mechanisms, but they do not on their own allow us to identify the
specific genes and variants that govern resilience in humans. These limitations create a critical need for
innovative approaches to synergize the power of animal HD models with the wealth of medically relevant
human data. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify drivers of resilience to HD motor, cognitive and
survival traits by applying system genetics approaches that integrate high-dimensional molecular data from
individual strains resilient to mHTT with cognitive and pathologic data collected in the same strains
longitudinally to provide candidate genes that are then tested for disease modification in human HD. To this
end, a novel mouse panel that incorporates a mHTT heterozygous knock-in allele expressing full-length mutant
huntingtin at endogenous levels, on a segregated background of genetic diversity (BXD panel) will be
generated to identify modifiers that contribute to HD resilience in a ‘humanized’ mouse population (Aim 1).
Network approaches will be used to integrate these novel data with existing human HD data to identify
modifiers of human HD resilience (Aim 2). Finally, these modifiers will be validated by performing in-depth
neurobiological and behavioral phenotyping on new precision HD models (Aim 3). These studies will enable
the discovery and validation of novel targets for promoting healthy brain aging overall and resilience to HD in
particular."
10747333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the tumor
microenvironment that govern hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, with a special focus on the role of
hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) as central players in this process. While it is clear that activation of non-parenchymal
cells is a key contributor to liver tumorigenesis, unfortunately, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
whereby key stromal and immune cell populations regulated HCC initiation and progression still is fragmentary.
Activated HSCs are key contributors to liver fibrosis and inflammation. The present proposal is based on our
previously published results demonstrating that the autophagy and signaling adaptor p62 is reduced in HSCs
from HCC patients and that its inactivation in mice, either globally or HSC-specific, promoted HCC due to the
hyperactivation of the inflammatory and fibrotic activities of HSCs. Our new unpublished preliminary results
demonstrate that the genetic ablation of NBR1, either globally or selectively in HSCs, completely reverts the pro-
tumorigenic role of p62 deficiency in HSCs. However, this unexpected effect of NBR1 deficiency does not revert
the pro-fibrotic, TGFb-driven effect of p62 loss and did not affect autophagy but resulted in the hyperactivation
of the interferon (IFN) cascade that renders CD8+ T cells more active, increasing anti-tumor immunosurveillance.
Our preliminary data also suggest that this hyperactivation of the IFN pathways is due to impaired chaperone-
mediated autophagy (CMA). Therefore, in this proposal we intend to unravel the mechanisms whereby NBR1
promotes CMA to restrain IFN activation. We will also establish how reduced CMA due to the inactivation of
NBR1 in HSCs results in the reprograming of the tumor microenvironment to repress tumorigenesis. To that end,
we will build on our preliminary data to address the following critical questions: (Aim 1) Establish the molecular
mechanisms whereby NBR1 regulates the IFN response in HSCs by (Aim 1.1) determining the effect of NBR1
and p62 inactivation on CMA activity in HSCs; (Aim 1.2) determining the functional contribution of CMA to NBR1-
mediated IFN regulation in HSCs; and (Aim 1.3) determining the molecular mechanisms whereby NBR1
regulates CMA. We will also (Aim 2) establish the contribution of NBR1 to HSC activation and the creation of a
tumor-suppressive microenvironment by (Aim 2.1) determining the impact that NBR1 deletion in HSCs has in
the tumor microenvironment of HCC; (Aim 2.2) determining the functional contribution of the CMA-STING-IFN
axis in NBR1-deficient HSCs to HCC progression in vivo; and (Aim 2.3) determining the impact of NBR1 loss in
HSCs in therapy response and its relevance in human HCC. Results from these studies will serve to identify new
biomarkers as well as non-parenchymal new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of HCC."

Diabetes and other retinal vascular diseases are a major cause of vision loss. This work builds on our
measures of vascular remodeling in diabetes using adaptive optics (AO) retinal imaging. AO retinal imaging
provides highly accurate and reproducible measures of both structural changes to the vascular walls of
arterioles, and functional measures of blood flow and neurovascular coupling between visual stimulation and
blood flow. By taking advantage of the precision of AO imaging we can make highly reproducible and accurate
measurements of changes to retinal microvessels.
In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that using a unique index of vascular wall damage which is insensitive to
sampling biases can act as an index of diabetic damage. We will also generate a new measure of arteriole
damage based on variability in the thickness of the vessel walls, presumably arising from endothelial and
pericyte cell loss. We will then test whether these easily measured biomarkers are sensitive to local retinal
ischemia, and can be used to measure progression of DR. Improving measurements in early DR is important
as the clinical pathology is ultimately a consequence of these early changes. We will also test whether
impaired neurovascular coupling is associated with these vascular changes. In Aim 2 we will measure early
changes to the cone photoreceptors in diabetes, including both local areas of less reflective cones and regions
of disordered cones and relate these changes to vascular changes. By also measuring visual sensitivity in
areas with cone changes and those without we will test the hypothesis that imaging measurements can be
used to understand the sensitivity changes occurring in DR. In Aim 3 we will for the first time, measure
quantitative 3D flow maps of entire regions of the retinal vascular network. Flow maps include information as
to where blood is flowing, velocity, size and in which direction allowing network quantification. Because the
distribution of flow through a vascular network is sensitive to physical and biological constraints, flow maps will
change markedly as capillary occlusion occur.
By combining our state-of-the-art for retinal imaging of the vasculature with clinically available data we will
continue to better understand the anatomical and functional basis for clinically observable damage. This work
will advance our long term scientific goals of understanding the role that early vascular changes play in vision
loss, our clinical goal of developing new approaches to identify those individuals most at risk for damage, as
well as allow improved monitoring of future treatments on an individual basis."
10747354,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Prostate cancer lethality is mainly due to metastasis, which occurs most frequently in bone and is
associated with high morbidity. Despite recent progress, current treatments are not curative and therefore new
therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Given that both metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance
occur in the context of a whole organism and are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, one significant
challenge to our current understanding of metastatic progression is the paucity of models in which to study
metastasis in its physiological context, and especially models that recapitulate the bone tropism of human
prostate cancer.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how the molecular alterations present in lethal
prostate cancers contribute to disease outcome and how to use this knowledge to develop more effective
therapies. In particular, my preliminary data strongly suggests MYC as a driver of bone metastasis progression.
Given that MYC has traditionally been hard to target therapeutically, this proposal will leverage unique mouse
models of bone metastasis to address specific therapeutic vulnerabilities to target MYC signaling dependencies
in prostate cancer. Specifically, in Aim 1 I will study small molecule inhibition of the ATAD2-bromodomain as a
strategy to inhibit metastasis and therapy resistance. In Aim 2, I will use CRISPR screens to identify synthetic
lethal vulnerabilities of prostate tumors with high MYC activation. In Aim 3, I will exploit CRISPR technology to
somatically edit the genomes of mouse prostates in order to streamline the study of the phenotypic
consequences of genetic alterations for prostate cancer progression.
 The career development plan outlined in this award leverages my training at Columbia University and an
outstanding advisory committee into an innovative research plan to steer my career into specific precision
medicine approaches for the treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis. This proposal will provide the
conceptual groundwork, preliminary data and experimental tools for a competitive R01 submission, thus
launching my independent career.
 If successful, this award will provide proof-of-principle for a new class of targeted agents and uncover
new therapeutic vulnerabilities in metastatic prostate cancer as occurs in vivo. This proposal will advance the
field by potentially leading to novel clinically testable hypotheses that may guide clinical trials. Ultimately, these
results will impact patient care by reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with metastatic prostate
cancer."

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor is virtually always fatal. The primary modes of
therapy—surgery, radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide—have led to only marginal improvements in
survival. A hallmark of GBM is their high vascularity. Blood vessels within GBM, consisting of mostly
endothelial cells and pericytes, not only play the important role of providing nutrients and oxygen to the tumor,
but also provide direct trophic support to the tumor cells and serve as conduits for migration out of the tumor.
However, anti-angiogenic therapies directed against tumor vasculature have not been successful. A number of
studies have revealed that tumor pericytes and endothelial cells can be derived directly from tumor cells,
although tumor-derived endothelial cells are relatively rare occurrences in untreated tumors. The number of
tumor-derived endothelial cells is greatly increased in recurrent tumors, suggesting that glioma therapy, such
as radiation, could influence this process. Our preliminary studies show that radiation can induce the
production of endothelial-like and pericyte-like cells in vitro and in animal models in vivo. These reprogrammed
cells are important for the growth of the tumor following radiation in vivo and we have begun to define what
factors the reprogrammed vascular cells produce to support the growth of the remaining tumor cells following
radiation. Our preliminary data indicate that radiation induces altered chromatin states that allow for
reprogramming to occur; a process that is potentially therapeutically targetable through the inhibition of the
histone acetyltransferase (HAT), P300. The goals of the current studies are to understand the process of
vascular reprogramming (RIR) and to determine how it influences brain tumor biology. Our hypothesis is that
vascular reprogrammed cells provide critical trophic support to the remaining tumor cells under the harsh
conditions that occur following radiation. First, in Aim 1 we will determine whether therapeutically relevant
doses of radiation promote vascular RIR. We will then use cell ablation strategies to validate our preliminary
data indicating that radiation-induced reprogramming is important for the subsequent growth of the tumor
following radiation treatment using both xenotransplantation and immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models.
Next, we will explore the mechanisms by which radiation reprogrammed endothelial-like and pericyte-like cells
promote the growth of the remaining tumor, determining what specific factors they elaborate, and whether
these factors are responsible for tumor survival and growth following radiation. We will then test the hypothesis
that radiation induces the formation of vascular-like cells through modification of chromatin accessibility via
augmentation of histone acetylation through the P300 histone acetyltransferase, allowing for access of
vascular-specifying transcription factors. Finally, we will use pharmacologic agents to therapeutically target the
process of RIR through inhibition of the P300 HAT. These experiments can lead to a new understanding of
mechanisms underlying resistance to radiation therapy and open the door to new treatments."
10747376,"Diets high in fat have been linked to obesity, and a high fat diet (HFD) has been implicated in altering intestinal function, including inflammation; however, the contribution of specific HFDs and their predominant fatty acids (FAs) on key pathophysiologic processes is largely unknown. Studies with trans-fats, lard, olive oil, fish oil, plant- based fats (corn oil, soybean, etc.) have demonstrated that specific sources of FAs exert extremely diverse effects in disease, most commonly in cardiac and metabolic disease. Therefore, the long-term goal of this proposal is to dissect the complexity of components and effects of specific dietary FAs on gut pathobiology and determine the mechanisms involved. Specifically, we aim to define the specific roles of two ceramide-generating enzymes, ceramide synthases (CerS) 5 and 6, in the regulation of myristate-induced activation of inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and define their critical roles in intestinal homeostasis and pathophysiology. IRE1α is a critical branch in the unfolded protein response (UPR) or ER stress and is an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism to overcome stress in the ER, resulting in a pause of new protein synthesis and induction of chaperone proteins to restore normal ER function. Functionally, ER stress and IRE1αv have been linked to alterations in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Specifically, ER stress genes are upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from a murine experimental colitis model (IL10-deficient)1 and in IECs or biopsies from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients1,2. IRE1α, as well as other effectors of ER stress, can be initiated by several triggers including high fat diet (HFD) or treatment with saturated FAs, as well as exogenous and endogenous sphingolipids3-5. These important clues in the literature, together with our studies on bioactive sphingolipids in intestinal inflammation, led us to investigate the role of specific dietary FAs in sphingolipid metabolism and their role and mechanism(s) of action in intestinal ER stress. Our very novel observations demonstrate that the C14 saturated FA myristate (rich in milk based diets), but not palmitate (C16 saturated FA), increases ER stress, as well as inflammation in IECs in culture and in mouse intestinal tissues in vivo6. Mechanistically, ceramide synthases 5 and 6 (CerS 5 and 6) are required for the activation of IRE1α branch of the UPR, inducing splicing of XBP1 and expression of IL66. Importantly, these data now lead us to the hypothesis that CerS5/6 and the generation of C14 ceramide regulate IRE1α in the intestine and that this may mediate specific responses in intestinal pathobiology (specifically intestinal inflammation). To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Determine the role of CerS5/6 in the regulation of ER stress, specifically IRE1α, in intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal organoids. Specific Aim 2. Define the role of CerS5/6 in ER stress-mediated intestinal pathobiology in vivo."
10891730,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop innovative statistical methods for designing more effective
HIV treatment and prevention interventions, along with more effective implementation strategies to deliver them.
Due to HIV secondary transmission and social influence of preventive behaviors, the intervention received by
one individual can have an effect (or spill over) on the risk for HIV infection, risk behaviors, retention in care and
treatment adherence of other individuals. This mechanism, called ‘interference’ in causal inference, remains a
major challenge for the evaluation of HIV interventions.
 Statistical methods accounting for interference are necessary for valid estimation of the individual effect of an
intervention and of the overall population effect, as well as for understanding the extent to which social context
plays a role though spillover effects and how it can be leveraged. This proposal will develop innovative methods to
1) disentangle individual and spillover effects of time-varying package intervention components in cluster random-
ized trials with interference and non-compliance to the assigned components; 2) in network-based and cluster
randomized studies, correct for bias due to misspecification of the interference sets, that is, the sets of individuals
whose treatment affects the outcome of others. 3) identify individuals who are more likely to influence their peers
to adopt behavioral changes and evaluate the improved effectiveness of strategies that target these individuals.
This project will define novel causal estimands for the causal questions of interest, and extend marginal structural
modeling methodology to adjust for confounding and spillover and to evaluate hypothesized strategies leveraging
component-specific effects and influence heterogeneity. Bias correction for mismeasured transmission and social
influence networks will be based on a main study/validation study approach comparing the use of phylogenetic-
based clusters, social and sexual networks, and spatially-based networks and clusters. User-friendly software
implementing the proposed methods will be developed and made publicly available to facilitate their uptake. To
further facilitate dissemination, short courses about the new methods and software will be offered.
 The development of statistical methods will be motivated and applied to two large cluster randomized trials in
Botswana (BCPP) and South Africa (TasP) and three network-based peer education studies (HPTN 037, CHAT,
STEP), providing new insights into effective combinations of HIV interventions at the individual and community
level and into novel strategies to leverage spillover and strengthen the impact of these interventions. The methods
will be broadly applicable to many public health interventions for HIV and other infectious diseases.
 Our proposal fits within the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health - Division of AIDS Research, as
well as that of a recent NOSI (NOT-AI-21-054), to advance the development and testing of behavioral and biomed-
ical interventions by incorporating social context and behavioral science to understand and leverage transmission
networks and social influence, as well as their social determinants."
10763780,"Title: Structure and Function of TRPV channels
The long-term objective of this research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms of gating and
cellular function of the two physiologically important members of the TRPV subfamily: transient receptor potential
vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5). These channels belong to the same
subfamily of TRP channels, nevertheless they exhibit striking differences in their tissue distribution, physiological
function, cellular localization, ion permeation and selectivity, mechanisms of channel gating and pharmacology.
TRPV2 is broadly expressed Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel, which plays a vital role in neuronal
development, immunity, cardiovascular physiology, and cancer. TRPV5 is a highly selective Ca2+ channel, that
is only expressed on the apical membrane of kidney distal convoluted tubule epithelial cells and plays a critical
role in Ca2+ homeostasis in the human body. This proposal is built on the major advances achieved by my group
in understanding TRPV2 and TRPV5 channels structures, molecular details of gating and cellular function in the
last 10 years. The overall goal of this proposal is to further understand how TRPV2 and TRPV5 channels are
gated by endogenous and exogenous modulators at the atomic level; and to elucidate TRPV2 channel precise
molecular function in neuronal development and immunity. To answer these questions, we will employ cutting-
edge multidisciplinary approaches available to our laboratory, including membrane protein biochemistry and
biophysics, single-particle cryo-EM, peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labeling and mass spectrometry, cryoAPEX
for electron microscopy imaging, flow cytometry, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and functional
characterization by electrophysiological and cell biological methods. This information would be critical in our
understanding of TRPV channels physiological and pathophysiological roles."
10763812,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common inherited cause of death in infants
and young children. SMA is caused by the deletion or mutation in the survival of motor neuron 1
(SMN1) gene, leading to a deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein. Recent
approved therapies increase SMN protein and partially correct the motor neuron loss and
muscle degeneration that are hallmarks of the disease. However, SMA patients require critical
care as a result of cardiopulmonary impairment and opportunistic infections. This observation,
together with extensive new preliminary data, leads us to hypothesize that SMN-deficiency
impairs cardiomyocyte function, representing a previously unrecognized contribution of the
cardiovascular system on SMA disease pathology. To test this hypothesis, we will use primary
cardiomyocytes from a mouse model of the disease and human cardiomyocytes derived from
SMA patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to determine the consequences of SMN
deficiency on contractile function (Aim 1), the molecular mechanisms leading to impaired
contraction (Aim 2), and characterize cardiovascular deficiencies following SMN restoration in
SMA mice (Aim 3). The preliminary results using our unique approach are already providing
novel mechanistic insight into a poorly understood aspect of the SMA disease process which
could be critically important when designing strategies to manage the disease clinically."

Uptake of HIV and STI testing among gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the rural
southern US is low. However, HIV and STI testing is a fundamental gateway to preventive services, such as
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and treatment provision. Thus, it is critical that we identify methods to
increase uptake of HIV and STI testing among this population that experiences disproportionate HIV and STI
incidence. We have developed an app, Combine, that is an adaptation of HealthMindr, an app that has
demonstrated efficacy in increasing uptake of HIV testing among urban GBMSM. Combine was adapted using
input from GBMSM in rural areas to address issues specific to this population such as increased experiences
of stigma and reduced access to culturally competent care. We propose to conduct a Type 2 Hybrid
Effectiveness-Implementation randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of Combine to increase uptake of
HIV and STI testing over 24 months of follow-up and to examine the effect of different implementation
strategies among GBMSM in the rural South. Combine will include components for self-administered risk
assessments, developing and supporting a plan for frequent HIV and STI testing, information about PrEP, and
PrEP and HIV/STI testing provider locators. Previous trials of app-based HIV prevention have included the
ability to order free HIV and STI self-test kits. However, there is not a consensus among health officials around
whether at-home self-tests are an optimal solution for increasing HIV and STI testing. Additionally, despite the
availability of free HIV and STI self-test kits in previous studies, large proportions of men still do not complete
HIV tests and even fewer complete STI tests. Thus, we will evaluate the effect of two different intervention
components on HIV and STI uptake in a 2x2 factorial trial design: availability of HIV and STI self-test kits
ordered through the app and a motivational interview designed to enhance the existing app content, increase
self-efficacy to develop and follow through with a testing plan, and develop strategies to deal with experiences
of stigma. All participants will receive the Combine app, including a locator to identify nearby HIV and STI
testing centers. Men in the control arm (Arm 1) will not have the ability to order HIV and STI self-test kits and
will not receive a motivational interview; men in Arm 2 will not have the ability to order HIV and STI self-test kits
but will receive a motivational interview; men in Arm 3 will be able to order free HIV and STI self-test kits but
will not receive a motivational interview; and men in Arm 4 will have the ability to order HIV and STI self-test
kits and will receive a motivational interview. We will assess the main effects of the availability of HIV and STI
self-test kits and the motivational interview on HIV and STI testing uptake, PrEP initiation, and intervention
maintenance over 24 months of follow up. Our community-based partner, Engaging Arkansas Communities,
will work with us through all stages of the project to ensure that we are obtaining the necessary data to inform
future implementation."
10745319,"Lung adenocarcinoma accounts for about 40% of all lung cancers and is the most common form of lung
cancer found in women and in people under the age of forty-five. Strikingly, the 5-year survival rate for lung
cancer overall is only about 18 percent, and more than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of
diagnosis. This highlights the need for more effective treatment options and underscores the importance of
research focused on uncovering and understanding new molecular and cellular pathways that contribute to
lung cancer biology. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are subject to various posttranscriptional modifications
including N6-Methyladenosine (m6A). m6A is the most abundant mRNA modification and is emerging as an
important regulator of gene expression that can affect mRNA splicing, export, stability, and translation. m6A
is catalyzed the METTL3 methyltransferase complex, and occurs at a characteristic sequence motif at a
position close to the translation stop codon of a large subset of mRNAs. The goal of this proposal is to test
the central hypothesis that METTL3 is a novel oncogenic factor in lung cancer. The global m6A mRNA
`epitranscriptome' will be mapped and measured in a cohort of primary human lung tumor samples. Relative
levels of METTL3 in tumors will be measured by immunohistochemistry and correlated with the m6A levels
and transcriptome-wide distribution. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments will address the widespread
impact of METTL3 (and METTL3-interacting proteins) in controlling target mRNA expression, and will help
uncover the molecular and cellular role of METTL3, METTL3-interacting proteins, and a selection of
downstream targets mRNAs, in lung cancer cell biology. Finally, the effects of METTL3 manipulation in lung
tumor initiation and progression will be explored using a mouse lung cancer model, as well as a novel lung
organoid model and a panel of assays will be deployed to examine the underlying molecular mechanism.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will help establish METTL3 as a possible future therapeutic
target for lung adenocarcinoma and other cancers."
10906103,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are important respiratory viruses which
cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in pediatric, elderly and immunocompromised patients.
Sensitive molecular techniques show that patients with respiratory infections are frequently infected with more
than one viral pathogen. In the case of RSV and HMPV co-infections, while some studies found no or limited
impact of co-infection, other research strongly indicates that RSV-HMPV co-infection has a deleterious effect on
the course of disease and severity of symptoms. However, few studies have examined the molecular details of
co-infection by these two important pathogens. Thus, the impact of RSV/HMPV co-infections remains a critical
area for continued study, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which co-infections may affect
the steps of the viral lifecycle. Viral interference through triggering of innate immunity and also competition for
cellular resources have been studied for their roles in co-infection, and very recent work suggests that hybrid
viral particles can form between influenza and RSV. Our preliminary studies of HMPV/RSV co-infection
demonstrate that inclusion bodies (IBs), which are key regions for viral transcription and replication, can contain
both RSV and HMPV genomes in co-infected cells, indicating a shared replication compartment. Our overall
hypothesis is that HMPV/RSV co-infection affects both virus replication and virus spread. To test this, we will
pursue two Specific Aims, using a range of experimental approaches and the wealth of reagents we have created
for the examination of pneumovirus infection. First, we will dissect the effect of HMPV/RSV co-infection on IB
formation, dynamics and viral replication, including careful analysis of IBs over the course of infection and
analysis of viral transcription and replication at the global and single cell level. Second, we will determine the
effect of HMPV/RSV co-infection on potential formation of functional hybrid virus particles. In addition, we will
examine whether a unique pathway for cell-to-cell spread which we have characterized for HMPV is also utilized
by RSV during co-infection. These important experiments will elucidate new molecular consequences of viral co-
infection, providing insight that may inform studies of additional respiratory viruses and lead to new ways to
target respiratory virus infections."

states. In keeping with program objectives CoSIBS will continue to inspire the next generation of
biostatisticians and data scientists to pursue advanced study and research careers in the
biomedical, behavioral, and quantitative health sciences. We will recruit an enthusiastic and
diverse group of advanced undergraduate and early-stage graduate students who are interested
in exploring the frontiers of data sciences in the development and application of new methods for
using big data to guide the diagnosis, care, and prevention of disease. The proposal is structured
to provide innovative educational programs using the established research in biomedical data
sciences with NHLBI and NIAID-related research programs that cut across departments at
University of Colorado Denver and affiliated institutions. The proposal draws together a range of
faculty including faculty from the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, the Department of
Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, and faculty from other departments with research interests
in bioinformatics and data science. CoSIBS will be a 6-week resident summer institute for
approximately 20 advanced undergraduate students or recent graduates. The institute will consist
of approximately 4 hours per day of class and laboratory instruction. The didactic portion will be
at a standard that would be typical of a one-year course in basic statistics as often required in
undergraduate curricula. In addition, students will have mentored projects that are tied to ongoing
research groups at UCD and affiliated institutions. Projects will be co-mentored by faculty with
research interests in biostatistics, statistical genetics, or bioinformatics, and a companion
biomedical investigator from a leading NHLBI-related research group at UCD. The projects will
reinforce course content in study design, data analysis, software applications, and the preparation
of results for publication or presentation to biomedical researchers. An innovative mentored
summer fellowship opportunity will be launched with an institutionally supported stipend for
students from historically underrepresented populations to work with DBI faculty on collaborative
research projects during the weeks preceding and following the 6-week CoSIBS program."
10778540,"ABSTRACT
Demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, are characterized by loss of myelin-producing
oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and cause severe disability for millions of patients.
Existing therapies for MS exclusively modulate the immune system to prevent additional myelin loss;
no regenerative therapies are available that replenish lost oligodendrocytes and repair lost myelin.
Multiple researchers have used high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries to identify drugs
that increase the formation of oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in vitro
and enhance functional remyelination in vivo. One such molecule, the FDA-approved antihistamine
clemastine, was recently shown to enhance optic nerve conduction velocity in MS patients with optic
neuritis, providing the first clinical evidence that small molecule treatments can enhance remyelination
in the human CNS.
While this trial provides proof-of-concept for future remyelinating therapeutics, greater clarity around
the optimal pathways and targets controlling oligodendrocyte formation is critical to the success of
future translational efforts. Our multi-disciplinary team has leveraged synergistic expertise in glial
biology, chemical biology, and organic synthesis to provide compelling preliminary evidence, now
published in Nature and Cell Chemical Biology, that almost all promyelinating small molecules identified
by HTS enhance oligodendrocyte formation by inhibiting a small number of adjacent enzymes within
cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of these enzymes causes accumulation of specific, structurally-
related cholesterol precursors (8,9-unsaturated sterols) which are sufficient to enhance the formation
of oligodendrocytes from OPCs. Mass spectrometry-based sterol profiling has demonstrated more
than three dozen promyelinating small molecules function by this mechanism, including clemastine.
This application advances two parallel goals. First, we seek to understand how 8,9-unsaturated sterol
accumulation drives oligodendrocyte formation, including defining the optimal sterols and elucidating
their cellular target (Aims 1 and 2). Additionally, we aim to optimize the first selective and brain-
penetrant EBP inhibitor and to validate that this molecule promotes remyelination in vivo and human
myelin formation in vitro (Aim 3). Organic synthesis is a key technique throughout the application,
enabling the synthesis of novel 8,9-unsaturated sterols (Aim 1), photoaffinity pulldown reagents (Aim
2), and novel derivatives of our recently-published EBP-inhibiting lead molecules CW9009 and
CW9956. Together these studies will accelerate the emerging field of remyelinating therapeutics by
developing optimized small molecules for further drug development and identifying novel drug targets
that underlie the oligodendrocyte-enhancing effects of 8,9-unsaturated sterols."
10778542,"Project Summary
The ability to coordinate movements of the limbs is one of the main features of locomotion in mammals. Interlimb
coordination is essential for maintaining balance when navigating in complex and/or changing environments. It involves
complex dynamic interactions between neural circuits at different levels of the nervous system and biomechanical
properties of the musculoskeletal system to allow animals to adjust locomotor speed and gait for goal-oriented behaviors.
Interactions within the nervous system include those between the spinal circuits controlling each limb, supraspinal inputs
and sensory feedback from the limbs. Neurological disorders resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI) and other diseases
disrupt limb coordination in humans and animal models, thus impairing locomotion. Despite their obvious importance, the
mechanisms that control interlimb coordination and contribute to locomotor recovery following SCI and other
neurological disorders remain poorly understood.
 To address this gap in knowledge, we will integrate multiple experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the
neural and biomechanical mechanisms controlling interlimb coordination in a feline model before and after SCI disrupting
neural communication between the brain and spinal cord and/or between the circuits controlling fore- and hindlimb
movements. The project will be performed in close interactive collaboration between three groups of investigators with
strong and complementary expertise in the experimental study of cat locomotion, including SCI models (Alain Frigon,
Université de Sherbrooke), biomechanics of cat locomotion (Boris Prilutsky, Georgia Tech) and neural control of
locomotion (Ilya Rybak, Drexel University).
 The project has the following Specific Aims: (1) Characterize muscle synergies and limb kinematics in intact and
spinal cats during locomotion on regular and split-belt treadmills; (2) Extend and refine the current computational model
of neural circuits and spinal central pattern generators involved in the control of locomotion; (3) Develop an integrated
quadrupedal neuromechanical model of cat locomotion Develop an integrated quadrupedal neuromechanical model of cat
locomotion; (4) Investigate the neural and biomechanical control of interlimb coordination during locomotion using
interrelated and complementary experimental and modeling studies.
 Results obtained from these studies will have an important theoretical impact on our understanding of how the limbs
are coordinated during locomotion and how this coordination is altered and adjusted after disruption of spinal pathways
between left-right or cervical-lumbar circuits. The results will identify neural pathways and biomechanical mechanisms
that could be targeted to improve interlimb coordination in people with various movement disorders, such as SCI, stroke,
and Parkinson's disease."
10778645,"Abstract
When motor neurons degenerate, they lose their ability to communicate with their downstream muscle targets and, as a
result, muscles weaken, often leading to paralysis and death. This commonality is shared between rare diseases such as
Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and SMA with Respiratory Distress Type I (SMARD1).
Collectively “rare” disorders are strikingly common, afflicting ~30 million people in the United States alone. Understanding
commonalties between these different conditions not only leverages disease-specific research but also provides
opportunities to exploit shared biochemical pathways for therapeutic development. With this as a backdrop, this project
focuses on the IGHMBP2 gene, that when mutated results in a severe motor neuron degenerative disease, SMARD1;
mutations in IGHMBP2 are also found in a subset of CMT2 (Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type2) patients. IGHMBP2 is a
ubiquitously expressed protein with helicase function and proposed roles in RNA regulation or RNA metabolism.
SMARD1 is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease that primarily affects children, with a life expectancy of ~13
months. The prevalence of SMARD1 is ~1 percent of early onset SMA patients. SMARD1 is initially characterized by distal
lower limb muscle atrophy with proximal muscle weakness later. The first major SMARD1 clinical symptom, respiratory
complication, is due to diaphragmatic paralysis. We have recently generated four unpublished mouse models with mutations
in Ighmbp2 that correlate to mutations within the SMARD1 patient population. The objective of this project is to characterize
two of the new models with Ighmbp2 mutations C495X and D564N. C495X correlates to the patient C496X mutation that
is the most prevalent IGHMBP2 mutation identified in SMARD1 and is also found in some CMT2 patients. C495X is found
as a homozygous recessive mutation and as a compound heterozygous mutation in patients and presents with respiratory
distress and motor neuron defects as early as days and as late as years. D564N correlates to the patient D565N mutation and
has only been identified as a compound heterozygous mutation with clinical symptoms initiating as early as several months
of age. D565N protein binds nucleic acid, has ATPase activity, but lacks helicase activity.
Experiments in AIM I are designed to address: disease onset, disease severity, and the relationship between the type of
mutation and SMARD1 symptoms. In AIM II we will examine the molecular and cellular phenotypes, including RNA and
protein expression, motor neuron and muscle analyses, and respiratory function. These data will be compared to studies that
have examined the nmd mouse (the only SMARD1 model currently available) and SMA and ALS models. AIM III will
address translational approaches. These studies should provide significant information into the role of Ighmbp2 in cellular
processes and SMARD1 development. Additionally, these studies should provide a greater knowledge base to facilitate
therapeutic development and a better understanding of the similarities and differences between related neurological diseases
to more completely address therapeutic development."

The overall goal of the NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and to explore how these mechanisms are
harnessed in vivo (in yeast and animal cells) to control diverse actin-based processes such as cell motility,
endocytosis, intracellular transport, and cell morphogenesis. Genetic and biochemical research has been
rapidly producing a ‘molecular parts list’ for the actin cytoskeleton, and many of the components have been
characterized individually for their biochemical effects on actin filaments and their genetic effects on cellular
actin organization and function. However, it is becoming clear that most of these proteins do not function alone,
but rather in groups to perform their biological roles, and thus, new approaches are needed to define how they
work in concert to perform their cellular functions. Our lab is tackling this problem using advanced single
molecule TIRF microscopy to directly observe multi-component actin regulatory mechanisms in real time, and
testing these mechanisms using genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural approaches. Through this
approach, we have made fundamental new insights into actin regulation. For instance, we defined the first
collaborative actin nucleation mechanisms of formins (with Bud6 & APC). We discovered that formins and
Capping Protein can bind simultaneously at filament ends to accelerate each other’s dissociation. We showed
that Cofilin, AIP1, and Coronin work together via an ordered mechanism to sever and disassemble F-actin. We
discovered that Srv2/CAP works in conjunction with Cofilin and Twinfilin to depolymerize filament ends. In
parallel, we have combined genetics, cellular imaging, and separation-of-function mutants to dissect the
contributions of these mechanisms to actin-based processes in yeast and mammalian cells.
Moving forward, we will ask the following questions: what are the complete regulatory cycles of the two yeast
formins (Bni1 and Bnr1)? How is Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation balanced by its inhibitors (Coronin
and GMF) and activators (Las17/WASP and Abp1)? How is actin nucleation at the leading edge of motile cells
controlled by interactions among IQGAP1, APC and formins? How do interactions at filament ends between
Capping Protein and formins (and their in vivo binding partners) control actin network growth? How do the
filament severing and depolymerization mechanisms (Cofilin, AIP1, Coronin, Twinfilin, and Srv2/CAP) drive net
disassembly of actin under the assembly-promoting conditions of the cytosol? Are there actin-associated
proteins that accelerate the nucleotide state transition on F-actin to promote disassembly? In addition, we will
introduce new technologies and directions to our research, including in vitro reconstitution of cellular actin
structures, cryo-EM to study protein structure, cell-free extracts to genetically-biochemically dissect actin
mechanisms, and a systems-level approach to determine how genetic disruptions in individual actin regulators
affect the cellular levels, localization, and functions of the remaining actin-associated proteins."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases constitute a major healthcare burden at a cost of >$125
billion per year. Autoimmune disorders arise from a failure of immunoregulatory networks. Regulatory T (Treg)
cells expressing transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) are indispensable components of these
networks. Moreover, recent studies from several groups suggest that Treg cells also facilitate tissue repair, in
addition to exerting immunosuppression. During autoimmune diseases, Treg cells are activated in lymphoid
organs and home to non-lymphoid target tissues where they persist in specialized niches to limit inflammation
and facilitate tissue repair. Our overall goal is to determine how these Treg cell niches operate in the central
nervous system (CNS) to ameliorate autoimmune neuroinflammation at cellular and molecular levels. Direct
visualization of cell behavior often leads to surprises, new hypotheses, and follow-up experiments contributing to
a better understanding of the mammalian immune system, and how autoimmunity and infectious diseases can
be effectively treated. Building on our expertise in two-photon (2-P) imaging at the cellular level, and Ca2+
signaling at the molecular level, we will use the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model
of MS to: 1) elucidate the local cues that drive survival, functional organization in niches, and motility behaviors
of Treg cells in the spinal cord; 2) investigate how Treg cells selectively target processes that incite
neuroinflammation. Our experimental approach includes evaluation of the Piezo1 channels as promising
therapeutic targets to selectively expand Treg cells, an ideal strategy to curb ongoing autoinflammatory
responses while preserving the immune system’s ability to fight new infections. Although this proposal is targeted
specifically to MS, in a broader context our project will provide fundamental insights into how Treg cells fine-tune
tissue inflammation so that better Treg-modifying therapies can be developed for autoimmune disorders, organ
transplantation, cancer, and infectious diseases."

Early life adversity (ELA) is one of the strongest lifetime risk factors for depression, anxiety, suicide, and other
psychiatric disorders, particularly after facing additional stressful events later in life. ELA sensitizes individuals
to future stressors and doubles the likelihood that a stressor in adulthood will result in an episode of depression
or anxiety. However, the neurobiological basis of this stress sensitivity, or priming, remains almost entirely
unexplored. Clinical and preclinical studies demonstrate a role for the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in ELA-
attributable mood and anxiety disorders, and that ELA alters the course of VTA development and its function in
response to both stressors and rewards. Using a mouse model to investigate the neurobiological impact of ELA,
I previously found that ELA leads to lifelong transcriptomic changes in VTA including unique transcriptional
response to adult stressors, which parallels latent behavioral changes we have observed. Gene expression is
regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, and it was recently shown that the chromatin landscape continues to
mature postnatally during a time when ELA has the greatest impact on stress sensitivity. Chromatin dynamically
responds to developmental and environmental cues, acts as a substrate of molecular memory in cells, and
facilitates adaptive gene expression response to recurring stimuli, a phenomenon termed epigenetic priming. In
this Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Scientists (BRAINS) proposal, I will test the conceptually
innovative hypothesis that ELA alters maturation of the chromatin landscape, priming chromatin in a cell-type-
specific manner as a biological mechanism of heightened reactivity to future stimuli. In Aim 1 we will apply cutting-
edge sequencing approaches and computational analyses to understand how the chromatin landscape matures
across normal postnatal development with cellular specificity, how ELA alters these trajectories, and whether
such changes are engaged in enhanced response to future stressors. In Aim 2 we will develop novel epigenome
editing tools to prime targeted genomic locations, which we will test in vitro and apply in vivo to understand
mechanisms of sensitivity to future stimuli. While our CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenome priming approach entails
a degree of risky innovation, it is balanced by promising preliminary data and we provide alternative approaches
that would mitigate failure of this high-risk high-reward experiment. The proposed research will identify the
neuroepigenetic mechanisms through which developmental brain plasticity encodes adversity and confers
sensitivity to future stressors. This proposal is directly relevant to the NIMH Strategic Goal to examine mental
illness trajectories across the lifespan. Understanding how ELA alters the course of brain development at the
level of the epigenome has the potential to transform our understanding of the neurodevelopmental origins of
ELA-attributable mental illness and potential critical windows for intervention. The Advisory Council formed
through this BRAINS Award will optimally support the ultimate goal of translating our findings into development
of novel treatments to mitigate the impact of childhood adversity on adverse mental health outcomes."

The primary purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F30 application is to provide the framework that will
prepare the applicant for a successful career as a physician scientist. Much of the applicant’s career development
will come from work in electronic cigarette (eCig) inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction research, and
she will be provided the invaluable opportunity to carry out high quality research using a murine model of chronic
intermittent eCig vapor exposure. Cardiopulmonary diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide, and
cigarette smoking remains the most significant and preventable risk factor. While cigarette smoking prevalence
has steadily declined since 1950, there has been a recent drastic increase in the popularity of eCig or electronic
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Despite the perception that these products are “safer” alternatives to cigarette
smoking, recent cases of eCig or vaping product use-associated lung injury, denoted EVALI, demonstrate a
strong potential for harm. The impact of eCig on cardiopulmonary function has yet to be fully elucidated; however,
the applicant’s mentoring team demonstrated that chronic nicotine vapor inhalation alone induces activation of
the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice. Furthermore, preliminary data
for this proposal indicate nicotine induces vascular dysfunction. While the previous study demonstrates that
nicotine has detrimental cardiopulmonary impacts, it is unknown if the addition of other eCig components (e.g.
propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin) will produce the same or greater harmful effects. Thus, investigation into
the possible synergistic activity of eCig additives with nicotine is warranted. The OBJECTIVE of this proposal is
to evaluate the effects of chronic eCig vapor inhalation on cardiopulmonary function, which could contribute to
EVALI, in a murine model of chronic eCig vapor inhalation. The proposed HYPOTHESIS is that chronic eCig
vapor inhalation disrupts RAS homeostasis, leading to vascular dysfunction, PH, and right ventricular
(RV) remodeling. The proposed study will employ a wide variety of state-of-the-art tools and techniques to test
the hypothesis using two specific aims: (1) Chronic eCig vapor inhalation promotes vascular dysfunction, PH,
and RV remodeling, and (2) Mechanisms of chronic eCig vapor inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction
depend on RAS activation and angiotensin signaling mediated by the angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R). In
addition, this study will investigate if blocking angiotensin receptor signaling with Losartan will protect against
eCig vapor inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Findings from this study will advance our
understanding of the detrimental effects of eCig on the cardiopulmonary system and may identify novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of eCig related cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases (CVPD). With the
support of a strong multidisciplinary mentoring team, completion of the proposed training plan will ensure that
the applicant is ready to embark on a career in academic medicine."

High frequency of Myc gene amplification is found in many types of cancer, driving the oncogenic activity in
cancer progression. Here I have noticed that the gene encoding one component of the transcription machinery
mediator complex(MED) protein, MED30, is significantly co-amplified with Myc, and thus might complement the
effects of enhanced Myc transcription activity. This correlation suggests a potentially useful adjunct therapeutic
target in Myc-amplified cancer. MED contains thirty components and regulates gene expression by promoting
assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) and elongation. My preliminary data has revealed the
unequal structural and functional importance of individual component of MED, by which MED30, located in Tail
module, is required for assemble of at least the Tail and Middle MED modules, while, in contrast, another tail
protein MED15 is not required. Mechanistically, 1,6-hexanediol-disrupted phase separation play a critical role in
it. MED30 depletion leads to protein degradation of many other MED components, while MED15 does not. ChIP-
seq reveals MED is widely enriched in enhancer and active transcribed gene promoters, and regulates target
genes that represents a cancer-associated signature. MED works as a rapid transcription switch in response to
extracellular signals. Therefore, I propose to rigorously test the molecular basis for MED30 function as one of
the core components of MED, linked to cancer exhibiting Myc amplification, which will be the basis for
competitive binding-based drug targeting, and screening for small molecules that can interrupt mediator complex
by high affinity to MED30. I will further explore the molecular mechanism of MED involved transcription regulation
in synergistic with Myc, and investigate the in vivo effect of MED30 inhibition in many cancers, including
pancreatic cancer and a glioblastoma mouse model. This study will simultaneously extend our understanding of
the potential cooperative component of Myc-induced cancer, investigate the roles of phase separation in these
biological events, particularly on the aspect of protein stability regulation important for Mediator function, as well
as how the cells tune their transcriptional program through enhanced MED30 and Myc TF transcription activity.
I will focus on this overlooked and apparently common event in cancer biology, with the goal of providing new
insights into transcription inhibitory drug development and protein degradation-oriented drug targeting strategies."

The nature of the HIV-1 latent reservoir has recently been redefined. Our recent work has shown that a large
majority of the reservoir (on average 70%) is formed near, and presumably at, the time of therapy initiation. This
is a very different view of the reservoir from the historical one where the reservoir starts to be formed early after
infection and forms continuously. Suppression of viral replication changes the host environment to allow certain
cells, some of which are infected, to become long lived. We have also shown this is true for viral DNA even
though most of it is defective. Thus, the latent reservoir is marking a set of cells that transition to a long-lived
state with the initiation of therapy irrespective of their infection status. This new view of the latent reservoir begs
a number of key questions that are addressed in this application. First, if the reservoir is defined in a different
way does its formation have the same history? We will address this question by looking at two alternative
definitions of the latent reservoir: rebound virus during therapy discontinuation, and a putative ""deep"" reservoir
in both gut and lymph node tissue. Second, since our initial observations were made in a cohort of women, we
will ask the same question about the timing of reservoir formation in men. Third, since the initiation of therapy
determines when a majority of the reservoir is formed, we will examine whether the reservoir is disrupted and
reforms over a period of a drug holiday followed by therapy re-initiation. Fourth, we will determine the
differentiation state of the T cells harboring the subset of the reservoir that forms early prior to the initiation of
therapy. Fifth, we will follow the differentiation state of cells harboring the viruses that will form the long-lived
reservoir as therapy suppresses viral replication. Collectively these studies will complete our understanding of
when the reservoir forms, regardless of how one defines the reservoir, in both men and women. They will also
show the stability of the reservoir after reintroducing an inflammatory state that had previously largely prevented
the formation of the reservoir. Finally, they will start to explore the differentiation state of the T cells that form the
early reservoir and the cytokine environment present in the face of viral replication, then the differentiation state
these T cells transition to as part of the long-lived reservoir during suppressive therapy. These studies will provide
a conceptual framework for future new strategies to limit reservoir formation at the time of therapy initiation."
10764799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to determine the rules governing the activation of the receptors in the tumor
necrosis factor receptors super family (TNFRSF), for aiding the development of therapeutic antibodies
targeting these receptors. There are genuine needs for in-depth understanding of the mechanism by which
these receptors are activated, as many of them are targets for antibody-based immunotherapy. While receptor
activation accompanying receptor clustering is a general phenomenon observed for receptors of the TNFRSF,
existing approaches of developing agonistic/antagonistic antibodies rely largely on trial and error, and no
correlation between antibody affinity and functionality has been observed. The proposed research is based on
our recent finding that, for a few members of the TNFRSF, the receptor transmembrane helix (TMH) alone can
mediate higher-order receptor clustering to drive downstream signaling and that an important role of the
receptor ectodomain in the absence of ligand is preventing the TMH-mediated receptor activation. Thus
developing antibodies that specifically modulate the auto-inhibitory state of the ectodomain would yield more
selective and efficient activators or inhibitors of the receptors. To investigate the general applicability of this
mechanism, we will perform structural and functional studies of receptor TMH oligomerization and pre-ligand
association for other members of the TNFRSF. Based on our understanding of the mechanism of receptor
autoinhibition, we will develop high-throughput technology for discovering antibodies that activate or inhibit
members of the TNFRSF in conformation-specific manner. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a thorough
survey of receptor TMH clustering to identify TNFRSF members with TMHs that are capable of forming higher-
order interaction network and driving signaling. In Aim 2, we will characterize the pre-ligand association
structures for a few representative members of the TNFRSF to understand how receptor ectodomain physically
inhibit TMH clustering. In Aim 3, we will broadly survey the basic requirements of receptor activation to test our
proposed 3-2 rule of receptor activation. In Aim 4, we will exploit the autoinhibition concept to implement a
yeast display technology to screen for nanobodies/Fabs that specifically break or stabilize the pre-ligand
ectodomain association, as means of activating or inhibiting the receptors, respectively. The proposed
research will significantly advance our mechanistic understanding of receptor activation for the TNFRSF while
potentially discovering specific agonistic or antagonistic agents for several TNFRSF members such as DR5,
TNFR1, TNFR2, OX40, 4-1BB, CD40, and GITR, all of which are important immunotherapy targets."
10763033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developing new treatments to block multiple sclerosis (MS) while keeping beneficial immune function intact
constitutes a major goal in the field. T cells are central drivers of MS pathogenesis. Our work shows that the
transcriptional co-regulator OCA-B (gene symbol Pou2af1) is induced in stimulated primary CD4+ T cells,
where it docks with its cognate transcription factor Oct1 to regulate immunomodulatory target genes including
Il2, Il17a, Ifng, and Csf2 (Gmcsf). Interestingly, OCA-B drives the elevated expression of these genes only
under a very narrow range of conditions. Primary stimulation of OCA-B deficient T cells results in few gene
expression changes, however re-stimulating these cells after resting in culture results in gene expression
changes of 500-fold or more. These results indicate that OCA-B controls gene expression specifically under
conditions of antigen reencounter. We identified the molecular mechanism, which involves the removal of
inhibitory chromatin modifications that otherwise accumulate to stably silence gene expression. Repeated
antigen exposures are a necessary feature of autoimmunity. In vivo, OCA-B loss leaves T cell development
and primary pathogen responses intact, but impairs the establishment of CD4+ T cell memory. In both mice
and humans, T cells with memory-like phenotypes can underlie autoimmunity including MS. Human GWAS
studies identify polymorphisms at the Ocab/Pou2af1 locus, as well as in binding sites for OCA-B and Oct1, as
MS drivers. These findings suggest a potential “therapeutic window” in which targeting this pathway can be
used to treat MS while preserving T cell development and primary immune responses. Consistently, we have
shown that T cell-specific deletion of Oct1 blocks clinical and molecular manifestations of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) while keeping immune responses to neurotropic viruses intact. OCA-B’s
lymphoid-restricted expression pattern, and the viability and fertility of OCA-B germline null mice, make it a
more promising potential drug target compared to Oct1. Our preliminary data indicate that T cell-specific OCA-
B deletion also protects mice from classical EAE, and protects autoimmune-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD)
mice from a relapsing EAE model, specifically at the relapse phase. Our overarching hypothesis is that OCA-B
regulates key genes in autoreactive, pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 CD4+ T cells to drive MS pathogenesis. We
will realize the objectives of the study via two specific aims focused on OCA-B necessity and sufficiency:
Aim 1: Determine the cellular and molecular basis of OCA-B promotion of EAE pathogenesis.
Aim 2: Test OCA-B’s sufficiency in EAE pathogenesis."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major epidemic in the United States and current pharmacological treatments
result in ~50% relapse. Alternative strategies are needed to isolate, target, and repair the specific brain circuits
implicated in craving and relapse. Low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a new method of non-invasive
neuromodulation that can be focused anywhere in the brain with high spatial resolution. Ultrasound can be used
to up or down regulate activity in specific brain regions and is currently approved for treating other disorders in
humans. The application of LIFU to modulate specific brain circuitry as an intervention for addiction is unknown.
The goals of this application are to determine whether LIFU has utility as an anti-relapse intervention in
a rat model of OUD and to learn about the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie its effects. One
specific region implicated in addiction is the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). dmPFC glutamatergic
projections to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) underlie craving for many drugs, including opioids, as well as
time-dependent increases in craving (“incubation”) over protracted withdrawal. During early withdrawal, this
circuit is hypoactive and interventions that excite the dmPFC block the incubation effect. During late withdrawal,
this circuit is hyperactive and inhibition down-regulates activity and reduces craving. We propose to use inhibitory
or excitatory LIFU during the different withdrawal periods to modulate neuronal activity in the dmPFC – NAcc
circuit and reduce craving/vulnerability to relapse. In Aim 1, we will apply different doses of inhibitory and
excitatory LIFU to the dmPFC and measure neurochemical markers of dmPFC activity as well as specific
markers for dopamine and glutamate transmission in the dmPFC-NAcc pathway. Effects will be examined
acutely during early or late withdrawal, and then adapted to a 7-day treatment regimen. Next, using a 7-day
treatment regime, we will examine the effect of LIFU to the dmPFC during early (Aim 2) and late withdrawal (Aim
3) on vulnerability to relapse. Neurochemical markers will also be measured to relate brain activity to behavior.
Both males and females will be included. Based on previous research and preliminary data, our overall
hypothesis is that during early withdrawal, LIFU-induced excitation, but not inhibition, of the dmPFC will offset
deficits in neuronal activity and block the incubation of craving; whereas, during late withdrawal, LIFU-induced
inhibition, but not excitation, will decrease neuronal activity and block craving. Our long-term goal is to translate
LIFU into human clinical trials as an anti-relapse intervention for OUD. This application is a major step toward
this goal since the results will provide the necessary preclinical proof-of-concept data, as well as preliminary
evidence for its neuromodulatory effects."

Cardiac dysfunction is among the most common extrapulmonary complications of severe influenza virus
infections. Although the heart complications of influenza virus infection are a clearly recognized clinical
problem, they are poorly studied in terms of pathogenic mechanisms. We lack basic scientific understanding of
1) whether influenza virus directly or indirectly causes heart damage, 2) what viral features facilitate cardiac
tropism of certain strains, 3) how virus disseminates from the lung specifically to the heart in the absence of
viremia, and 4) how the immune system influences heart pathogenesis. The major barrier to mechanistic
research in this area has been the lack of tractable animal models that recapitulate significant cardiac
dysfunction in severe influenza. We have overcome this obstacle by developing interferon-induced
transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) KO mice as a model of severe influenza virus infection that includes viral
replication in the heart and significant cardiac electrical dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Importantly,
IFITM3 is an antiviral protein of the innate immune system in which common deficiencies in the human
population render individuals more susceptible to severe infections, making IFITM3 KO mice a relevant and
informative model. We will make use of this groundbreaking model in the following three Aims. In Aim 1, we
will determine whether virus dissemination and replication directly in heart tissue is required for this pathology
or whether influenza virus indirectly induces heart dysfunction through systemic inflammation from the severely
infected lung. To address this fundamental controversy in the field, we have developed a novel and innovative
recombinant influenza virus strain with specific inability to replicate in heart cells while being fully replicative in
the lung. In Aim 2, we will identify viral features that endow specific virus strains with cardiac tropism by using
a candidate viral gene approach with reassortant viruses, as well as an adaptive passaging approach. In Aim
3, we will solve the mystery of how influenza virus moves specifically from the lung to the heart in the absence
of viremia and other organ infections. For this, we will test whether infection of migratory immune cells
facilitates virus trafficking to the heart. We will further investigate how IFITM3 expression in hematopoietic
immune cells influences cardiac dissemination of virus and cardiac dysfunction during infection. Overall, our
research will answer fundamental questions in the influenza field, and will reveal new strategies for combatting
influenza-associated cardiac dysfunction."

10763039,"Patients with facial paralysis have an obvious facial disability that includes facial disfigurement and
impairment in soft tissue movements, particularly in facial expressive behaviors. Management requires a
tailored and, at times, disparate approach to correct the facial disability ranging from non-surgical
interventions to facial reanimation surgery. Surgeons’ plan treatment based on measurements made from 2D
images and subjective grading of the patient’s face, both of which are limited in scope and dimension. Recently,
we demonstrated the utility of novel, landmark-based, 3D dynamic and static quantitative (objective) measures
and modeling comparisons for the evaluation of facial disability in patients with facial paralysis and tracked
their recovery over a 12-week period (NIH DE 025295). Thus, the overall goal of this prospective,
observational study is to compare the facial disability and perception outcomes of facial reanimation surgeries
in patients with extensive and permanent, unilateral paralysis using the refined 3D analysis, and compare
patient-centered outcomes of facial appearance, well-being, and satisfaction using validated questionnaires.
There will be three groups of surgery patients who will have a free gracilis muscle transfer. Group 1 will have
muscle transfer driven by the trigeminal nerve (nV); Group 2 will have muscle transfer driven by a cross-face
nerve graft (nVII); and Group 3 will have muscle transfer driven by dual innervation using both nerves. The
data from these groups will be compared with previously collected data from historical controls. The null
hypothesis to be tested is that there will be no difference in the impact of the surgical change on facial disability
(primary HO) or on patient perception (secondary HO) effected by the three different surgical approaches for
facial/smile reanimation after controlling for patient characteristics.
Specific Aim 1. To assess (1) the differences in facial disability (impairment and disfigurement) before surgery
among the three surgery groups and compared to a historical control group (control data collected during the
precursor R21 grant); (2) the changes in facial disability that occur at 5 and 18 months after surgery among the
three groups; and (3) the differences in persistent facial disability 18 months after surgery among the surgery
groups and compared to the control group. Outcomes: 3D measures of facial soft tissue displacement, velocity,
and disfigurement (form).
Specific Aim 2. To compare (1) the differences in self-perceptions of facial appearance/well-being and patient
satisfaction among the three surgery groups and control group before surgery; (2) the changes in self
perceptions from before to 18 months after surgery among the surgery groups; and (3) the differences in self
perceptions among the surgery groups and the control group at 18 months after surgery. Outcomes:
Qualitative measures using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FACE), Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form Scale (SF-36) and the Pre/Postsurgical Perception and Satisfaction Scale (PSP).
Specific Aim 3. To compare the objective, 3D, quantitative assessments of patients’ facial disability with
surgeons’ currently used subjective and 2D assessments for the same patients in order to assess the differential
information provided by the 3D assessment approach (such as area affected, severity of defect, and extent of
resolution of disability) that is not available from the current subjective and 2D assessments. Outcomes: 3D
measures of facial soft tissue displacement, velocity, and 3D disfigurement (form); and surgeons’ subjective
assessments from eFACE rating scale and 2D measures from Face-Gram/Emotrics software."
10889261,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The governing premise of this application is that cardiac injury response falls along a continuum, depending on
species, developmental stage, as well as therapeutic/experimental manipulation. Lower organisms such as
zebrafish and neonatal mice are capable of complete heart regeneration following partial amputation or ischemic-
induced cardiomyocyte (CM) death. Remuscularization is facilitated by proliferation of pre-existing
cardiomyocytes (CMs). On the other hand, in response to cardiac injury or stress in adult mammals, CMs fail to
proliferate and instead undergo adverse hypertrophic remodeling that can result in cardiac dysfunction. There is
great interest in identifying molecules and signaling cues that guide CMs to undergo a proliferative versus
hypertrophic response so that we can modulate these factors to promote adult mammalian cardiac regeneration
and repair in response to injury. In this proposal we investigate the hypothesis that junctional and
cytoarchitectural proteins are key effectors that regulate how CMs respond to injury. Modulation of these proteins
coordinate the proliferative state of CMs, but also facilitate proper re-integration of CMs with neighboring cells
during cardiac regeneration. In preliminary studies, we initiated a screen for cardiac development and
regeneration in zebrafish mutants that disrupt factors known to regulate cell junctional and cytoskeletal proteins.
The selected proteins have known interactions with Hippo-Yap signaling, a pathway of significant interest for
promoting cardiac regeneration. From this screen, we identified Llgl1 as critical for zebrafish heart
morphogenesis and development, and Shroom3 as a factor that is critical for regulation of CM proliferation during
zebrafish heart regeneration. Subsequently, we found that CM specific deletion of either Llgl1 or Shroom3
impairs intercalated disc integrity which was associated with aberrant CM cell cycle activity in uninjured hearts.
Here, we propose to delineate the cellular and physiological role of Llgl1 and Shroom3 in mammalian CMs during
development and the post cardiac injury response in neonatal and adult mice, and to further investigate the
mechanism by which these proteins interact with Hippo-Yap pathway components. Aims 1 and 2 employ
transgenic mice with CM specific deletion of Llgl1 or Shroom3, respectively, to investigate the role of these two
proteins in cardiac development and the post injury response with emphasis on cell morphology and
establishment of junctional complexes and intercalated discs. We employ the zebrafish model to investigate the
mechanisms underlying Llgl1 and Shroom3 functions, and whether these factors are co-regulated by the Hippo
kinase, Lats1/2. Collectively, our proposed studies will elucidate the role of key effectors of the cardiac injury
response, capable of modulating CM cytoarchitecture and cell-cell junctions to promote functional regeneration
and restore a healthy myocardium."

This research proposal from a multi-disciplinary team including urgent and emergent care physicians,
ophthalmologists, and biomedical engineers seeks to improve the ability of non-specialty providers to provide
ocular exams at the point of care. Urgent and emergent care settings are frequently the access point of
patients seeking eye care. Standard of care instruments to examine the eye in these non-specialty settings are
notoriously difficult to use, and patients frequently are referred out for later specialty care at added expense in
time and delayed care. To improve the likelihood of diagnostically useful eye examinations in these non-
specialty settings, we will introduce a remote, semi-autonomous eye imaging system capable of retinal optical

illuminated imaging that can be used without need for on-site staffing for operation.
These developments have both direct immediate clinical and research applicability by providing the potential to
readily examine patient eyes where the patients already are. In addition, there are future implications as a
platform for remote diagnostic capabilities in other settings where specialty eye care may be limited."
10899638,"Titin is the third myofilament of skeletal muscle where it spans the I-band and A-band regions of the sarcomere.
Multiple titin mutations have been described that result in debilitating myopathies, highlighting titin's importance
in skeletal muscle and the need to understand all of titin's functions fully. Our current understanding of titin is
largely based on studying passive skeletal muscle and assuming that no established properties change when
skeletal muscle is activated. However, recent studies suggest that titin's I-band segment interacts with the thin
filament in contracting or diseased muscle, altering titin's extensibility from that in passive muscle and impacting
passive force and thick filament activation. Possible thin filament interaction sites are the PEVK element and the
N2A of skeletal muscle, the latter is part of a recently discovered novel stiffness regulation mechanism that
involves MARP1, a stress response protein. Using mouse models aims 1 and 2 focus on the roles of the N2A
and PEVK elements in regulating titin stiffness in skeletal muscle, including the effects of upregulating MARP.
We also study the role of titin in activating the thick filament in skeletal muscle. Important work in the myosin field
has shown that muscle activation requires thin filament activation (as is well-known) and thick filament activation
mechanisms (a more recent discovery). In relaxed skeletal muscle, myosin is either in the super-relaxed (SRX)
state or the disordered-relaxed (DRX) state. The conversion of SRX to DRX turns thick filaments ON, promoting
contraction. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the ON state of the skeletal muscle thick
filament, including a mechano-sensing mechanism that involves thick filament strain. We have previously
obtained evidence that titin-based passive force strains the skeletal muscle thick filament. Aim three will test the
hypothesis that this converts SRX to DRX myosin in skeletal muscle and switches the thick filament from OFF
to ON. High-resolution ATP turnover assays have revealed that although the SRX state occurs in each of the A-
band regions of skeletal muscle (the D-zone, C-zone, and P-zone), the C-zone has the highest level. In addition
to titin, the C-zone contains MyBP-C. Aim 4 will study the importance of each in SRX. It will also address the
effect of locally perturbing titin strain (by deleting single C-zone domains) on SRX in skeletal muscle. This work
has high novelty and addresses fundamental questions that have clinical relevance. All required models and
tools are available, an experienced team of collaborators is in place, and extensive pilot data support the guiding
hypotheses of the proposed research. This proposal is a significant step towards our long-term goal, which is to
gain a detailed understanding of the roles of titin in both passive and active skeletal muscle and contribute to our
understanding of the mechanistic basis of skeletal muscle disease."
10874773,"ABSTRACT
Cancer cells often exploit immune checkpoint molecules to suppress and evade immune responses;
by inhibiting this process, immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have transformed cancer treatment.
Unfortunately, ICB therapy only benefits <20% of patients, and there are no robust biomarkers for
predicting response in any individual patient. Recent data confirm that effective ICB responses require
activation of new T cells in lymph nodes. The T cell receptors on a given T cell are specific for certain
antigen epitopes, and only a small subset of naive T cells can recognize tumor antigens. Activation of
naïve T cells to initiate the anti-tumor response requires physical interaction with an antigen presenting
cell (APC) displaying the correct, specific cognate antigen recognized by that specific T cell. The co-
localization of the APC, naïve T-cell and cognate antigen is facilitated by the lymphatic system, which
can concentrate APCs and antigen in lymph nodes. However, due to the rich diversity of antigen
reactivity of the T cell population, there are limited numbers of T cells specific for any single antigen.
This fact, along with the random nature of T cell circulation and sampling of the many lymph nodes,
suggests that T cell activation depends on stochastic processes. Logically, the presence of more
antigen, or antigen in more lymph nodes should increase the probability of T-cell activation.
Furthermore, the trafficking and interaction of naïve T-cells and APCs can be disrupted by the presence
of metastatic cancer cells in the lymph node, which impairs anti-cancer immune responses and the
response to ICB. The proposed work analyzes how lymph node metastases impair the generation of
anti-cancer immune responses. We hypothesize that mechanical and physiological disruptions caused
by metastases can interfere with lymph flow, antigen transport and T cell trafficking in the lymph node,
and therefore directly affect anti-tumor immunity by reducing the probability of lymphocyte activation.
In this project, we will address this hypothesis using mechanistic, multiscale computational modeling to
identify specific reasons for the failure to initiate anti-tumor immunity. Our computational model will be
supported by our unique, state-of-the-art animal models to measure immune cell trafficking, lymphatic
function and tumor growth in various conditions. Once validated, the computational model will provide
a mechanistic framework for selecting additional treatments to increase lymphocyte activation and thus
the response rate to immunotherapy. We have assembled a team of leading computational modelers,
lymphatic biologists, immunologists and cancer biologists. This multidisciplinary team is supported by
expert collaborators in biostatistics, computational models of lymph nodes and measurements of lymph
flow in vivo. Together, the R01 team will gain critical insights into modes of failure of immune checkpoint
blockade and develop testable solutions to unleash anti-tumor immune responses for more patients
with cancer."
10906947,"Increased neuromuscular fatigability (the acute, exercise induced reduction in force) is an understudied
consequence of stroke. This is a clinically meaningful area of study because increased neuromuscular
fatigability can negatively affect task endurance for activities like walking, and successful rehabilitation strategies
require repeated levels of muscle activation and overload to cause functional gains in motor performance. In
addition to decreased neural drive to motorneuron pools, recent data indicate that reduced blood flow to
exercising paretic muscle may play a significant role in increased neuromuscular fatigability. Exercising muscles
require adequate blood flow to match the increase in metabolic demand, and we have shown that stroke
survivors have reduced blood flow to the leg muscles during exercise. During exercise, sympathetic nervous
system activity increases in an activity-dependent manner, causing vasoconstriction in inactive muscle beds. In
the active muscle, the release of local vasodilatory factors counteracts sympathetic vasoconstriction to maintain
vascular tone. This process, called functional sympatholysis, has been postulated to be critical to muscle
perfusion during exercise. Our central hypothesis is that in people with stroke functional sympatholysis is
impaired and results in dysregulated blood flow during exercise, which exacerbates neuromuscular fatigability
and limits motor function. We propose three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will establish impaired functional
sympatholysis in chronic stroke survivors and determine the relationship with metrics of neuromuscular fatigue.
We will test two hypotheses in Aim 1: 1) that functional sympatholysis during exercise is impaired in the paretic
leg of chronic stroke survivors compared to the non-paretic leg and age- and sex-matched controls, and 2) stroke
survivors with the highest degree of functional sympatholysis impairment will have greater paretic leg muscle
fatigability, and both impaired modulation of motor unit firing rates and increased metabolite buildup in the muscle
during exercise. In Aim 2 we will interrogate microvascular (dys)function in the lower extremity of chronic stroke
survivors. We will test two hypotheses in Aim 2: 1) that compared age- and sex-matched controls, chronic stroke
survivors will have reduced nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation to acetylcholine and an enhanced vasoconstrictor
response to locally infused norepinephrine, and 2) that maximum dilation to acetylcholine in the affected leg will
be positively associated with lower paretic muscle fatigability. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if a non-invasive
intervention called ischemic conditioning (IC), which is known to improve muscle performance and vascular
endothelial function, can improve functional sympatholysis, and if improvements in functional sympatholysis are
associated with reduced paretic muscle fatigability. We will test two hypotheses in Aim 3: 1) that IC causes
immediate and sustainable improvements in functional sympatholysis, and 2) that IC-induced improvements in
functional sympatholysis are associated with improved muscle fatigue resistance, and both greater modulation
of motor unit firing rates and less muscle metabolite buildup during fatiguing contractions."
10752854,"Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the intentional destruction of one’s body tissue without suicidal intent and for
purposes not socially sanctioned. While NSSI has been understudied among Veterans, the lifetime prevalence
rate of NSSI in Veterans (16%) is actually three times higher than the general population. NSSI is associated
with risk for violence, psychiatric distress, and marked impairment in psychosocial functioning. Although NSSI
is distinct from suicidal behaviors in several important ways, NSSI is one of the strongest predictors of a future
suicide attempt identified to date. However, current interventions show limited efficacy for NSSI. There is a
critical need to identify effective treatments for NSSI to improve functioning and prevent Veteran suicide.
The proposed research aims to adapt and enhance a promising new treatment, the Treatment for Self-Injurious
Behaviors (T-SIB), to reduce NSSI in Veterans. T-SIB is a nine-session individualized treatment that
incorporates evidence-based approaches to replace NSSI with behaviors that improve psychosocial
functioning. A core component of T-SIB is functional assessment that tracks antecedents and consequences of
NSSI behaviors to identify underlying functions of an individual’s NSSI. In Aim 1, T-SIB will be adapted for use
with Veterans and enhanced to incorporate functional assessments administered via ecological momentary
assessment (EMA). EMA reduces retrospective recall bias and can capture NSSI behaviors in-vivo. A
successive cohort design including two cohorts of Veterans (n = 5 each) will be used to refine the T-SIB
protocol. Qualitative and quantitative data will be reviewed after each cohort to make successive modifications.
In Aim 2, the feasibility and acceptability of T-SIB will be evaluated with a pilot randomized controlled trial
(RCT). Veterans with NSSI (N = 40) will be randomized to T-SIB enhanced with EMA or treatment as usual
(i.e., safety planning and referral to mental health services). Primary outcomes will include measures of
feasibility and acceptability. Additional measures of NSSI and psychosocial functioning will be administered at
baseline, posttreatment, and a three-month follow-up. In Exploratory Aim 3, multilevel modeling will be applied
to EMA functional assessments to examine intra- and inter-individual changes in antecedents, consequences,
and NSSI functions over a nine-week period. Study aims will support future investigator-initiated research (IIR)
applications to conduct a fully powered RCT to test the efficacy of T-SIB for Veterans.
The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow in the Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical
Center (MIRECC) at the Durham VA. The training aims associated with this proposal include: 1) gain expertise
in treatment development and clinical trial methodology; 2) acquire skills in advanced modeling of longitudinal
data; and 3) engage in professional development to prepare for a successful career as a VA clinical
investigator. These objectives will be supported by the candidate’s mentorship team of NSSI experts, including
the original developer of T-SIB, and VA investigators with experience conducting clinical trials emphasizing a
recovery framework. The research and training associated with this CDA-2 will prepare the candidate to
acquire critical content and methodological expertise to competitively apply for IIR funding and transition to
independence as a VA investigator. The candidate’s long-term goal is to build a career as a VA investigator
committed to identifying and implementing interventions that improve psychosocial functioning and prevent
self-directed violence among Veterans."

The intestinal epithelium is exposed to different classes of pathogens and is not only instrumental as a first line
of defense against invasion of the host, but also signals to immune cells in the underlying lamina propria when
pathogens are detected. The NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome has emerged as an important innate immune
sensor in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in bacterial gastrointestinal infection, leading to rapid extrusion of
infected cells and release of cytokines and eicosanoids upon pathogen recognition. The role of innate immune
sensing and the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome at the level of individual subtypes of IEC is not well understood.
Recently, we discovered that tuft cells uniquely among IECs release the eicosanoid prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)
after inflammasome activation. Tuft cells are a rare subtype of IECs primarily known for their role in anti-
parasitic immunity. The role of tuft cells during bacterial infection in general as well as the role of released
PGD2 in intestinal immunity is unclear.
Our preliminary data show that tuft cell inflammasome activation leads to increased tissue levels of IL-22, an
antibacterial cytokine that can be produced by TH17 cells or innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and that tuft cell
inflammasome expression protects from small intestinal bacterial colonization. Based on our preliminary data
and published data on PGD2 receptor expression we propose a tuft cell- ILC3 communication axis via PGD2.
We hypothesize that tuft cells are central sentinels of infection status of the small intestine and capable of
shifting the polarization of the intestinal immune response.
We aim to define the pathway leading to IL-22 increase after tuft cell inflammasome activation using in vivo
models of tuft cell specific inflammasome activation and conditional epithelial PGD2 synthase and ILC3 PGD2
receptor deficiency. Further we will define the importance of tuft cell infection and inflammasome activation
during bacterial gastroenteritis, using a model of infection clearance with an attenuated strain of Salmonella
that does not lead to systemic infection. We will also explore the capacity of the tuft cell inflammasome to affect
an ongoing type 2 immune response during co-infection with a parasite, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and
Salmonella. These studies will greatly contribute to our understanding of epithelial cell type specific pathogen
sensing and the intestinal immune systems capacity to react to different types of infection.
This proposal brings together studies in the Rauch laboratory at Oregon Health and Science University and the
expertise of the Tait Wojno laboratory at the University of Washington. Unique expertise in the Tait Wojno
laboratory in the use of murine models of helminth infection will be leveraged to collaborate on exciting studies
that complement expertise in the Rauch laboratory in epithelial cell biology, inflammasome biology, and
intestinal bacterial infection."

Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral replication and preventing disease
progression, HIV-1 persists in a long-lived reservoir of latently infected cells that harbor integrated proviruses
which can be reactivated, resulting in the lifelong requirement of ART. Efforts to identify strategies to eradicate
or induce treatment-free long-term HIV-1 remission are critical. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) differ
from ART in that they can recruit immune effector functions through their Fc domains to accelerate clearance
of viruses and infected cells. In addition, immune complexes are potent immunogens that can foster
development of host immune responses. 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are bNAbs that bind to the CD4 binding site
(CD4bs) and to the base of the V3 loop in HIV-1 envelope gp-120. Both antibodies show exceptional breadth
and potency in vitro, and protect against or suppress infection in animal models. When administered during
early chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection, 3BNC117 and 10-1074 led to sustained
virologic control in about half of the tested animals. This effect was due to CD8+ T cell mediated control of
viremia, suggesting that the bNAbs exerted immune enhancing effects. In HIV-infected adults, three doses
3BNC117 and 10-1074 over 6 weeks maintained viral suppression for an average of 21 weeks in individuals
harboring antibody-sensitive viruses, including two individuals who continued to maintain viral suppression for
at least 11 months after ART discontinuation. The potential immune modulatory effects of bNAbs are
dependent of the availability of antigen. Fully suppressive ART reduces the frequency of infected cells
expressing envelope to levels that appear to be too low to induce immunity. In contrast, bNAb-mediated viral
suppression may allow sufficient antigen expression to trigger immunologic effects, and these effects are likely
to be enhanced when bNAbs are used in combination with molecules known to modulate immune responses
and induce viral transcription. We propose to test these concepts using N-803, an interleukin-15 superagonist,
which has immune modulatory properties, such as enhancement of antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity, and induces HIV-1 reactivation. This project aims to conduct two clinical studies to evaluate the
antiviral activity of the combination of the long-acting (“LS”) variants of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in viremic HIV-
infected individuals, and to assess the ability of this long-acting dual-bNAb combination to produce sustained
viral remission when administered with the IL-15 superagonist, N-803, during ART interruption."
10879082,"Project Summary:
Our memories and behaviors are encoded by the plastic changes in connectivity between the trillions of synapses
connecting the neurons in our brains. Neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and stroke often
result in aberrant neural connectivity that causes debilitating deficits in cognition and behavior. One approach to
treating these disorders is to harness the brain’s natural plasticity mechanisms to restore lost function following
injury through neural stimulation. These plastic connectivity changes occur through two main identified
mechanisms: Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity. In accordance with Hebbian plasticity mechanisms,
connections are strengthened or weakened when activity between neurons is correlated or uncorrelated,
respectively. Stimulation-based approaches attempt to utilize this mechanism for inducing plastic changes with
limited efficacy to strengthen connectivity (long-term potentiation, LTP), while neglecting the effects of
homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms alter connectivity to maintain consistent
neuronal activity levels by modifying synaptic strengths, levels of inhibition, and the threshold for LTP induction
based on previous activity levels. Here, I hypothesize that homeostatic plasticity plays a significant role in
determining Hebbian-informed stimulation-induced plasticity outcomes and that both mechanisms of plasticity
can be engineered to improve these outcomes towards strengthening corticocortical connectivity. In aim 1, I
assess the impact of reducing neuronal activity on Hebbian-informed stimulation-induced functional connectivity
changes in healthy and diseased states. In the diseased state, I will measure the impact of this strategy on
promoting functional recovery following targeted cortical lesioning. In aim 2, I explore the suppression of
homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that oppose Hebbian-informed stimulation-induced functional connectivity
changes. The outlined research strategy will allow me to build experimental and professional skills that will propel
my career as I transition into a postdoctoral position. By incorporating homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in the
design of Hebbian-based stimulation protocols for targeted neural connectivity change, the findings of the
proposed study can transform the efficacy of future stimulation-based therapies for neurological disorders."
10856291,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by
demyelination in the corpus callosum and putamen due to the accumulation of alpha synuclein (α-syn) in glial
cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) within the oligodendrocytes. Previous data has shown that in post-mortem MSA
brain, α-syn pathology is accompanied by MHCII expression and increased infiltration of peripheral T cells
(CD4+). IFNγ released from CD4+ T cells enhances inflammation by binding to its receptor (IFNγR1) and,
through the JAK/STAT pathway, activates MHCII antigen presentation. Other studies have shown, the
neuroinflammation found in post-mortem tissue from MSA patients can be modeled in rodents through a modified
AAV, Olig001-SYN which has a high tropism (>95%) for oligodendrocytes. Moreover, the Oligo001-SYN rodent
model of MSA shows a similar robust CD4+ T cell response due to the oligodendrocyte α-syn expression. My
preliminary results showed there was significant neuroinflammation via increase in IFNɣ and MHCII expression
in the Olig001 mouse model. Additionally, when IFNɣ was knocked down there was a significant reduction in
overall MHCII expression and general neuroinflammation and demyelination. IFNɣ is required for
neuroinflammation and demyelination, however the cell specificity of IFNɣ remains unclear. Therefore, findings
from this proposal can address if Th1 cells (CD4+ T cells that produce IFNɣ) are required for MSA pathology."

Understanding molecular mechanisms that govern the aging process is critical in the face of the ever-increasing
incidence of age-related diseases. Loss of epigenetic regulation with age has emerged as a hallmark of aging,
but little is known about the mechanisms linking chromatin alterations to longevity. Recently, in collaboration with
the Brunet lab at Stanford University, we demonstrated that chromatin changes in the Caenorhabditis elegans
germline, specifically a deficiency in trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) via the Complex Proteins
Associated with Set1 (COMPASS), induce changes in expression of mTOR targets which orchestrate a
metabolic shift in somatic tissues to extend lifespan via a specific enrichment of mono-unsaturated fatty acids
(MUFAs). This effect is mediated by the SREBP1/SBP-1 transcription factor, which is activated through COPII-
mediated ER-to-Golgi transport. Recent data in mammals highlighted a critical role for CREB regulated
transcriptional coactivator (CRTC)2 in COPII trafficking, while we have shown that the sole C. elegans CRTC
modulates aging and energetic metabolism. Excitingly, my preliminary data indicate that CRTC-1 specifically
regulates lifespan extension in H3K4me3-deficient animals, establishing a novel role of CRTC-1 in the epigenetic
regulation of aging. My long-term goal is to understand how epigenetic regulation integrates environmental and
internal signals to influence gene expression and downstream cellular processes to promote longevity and
transgenerational benefits. This proposal will use a combination of genetics, microscopy, metabolomics, and
genomic approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms that mediate H3K4me3-dependent longevity. Aim 1
will define the spatiotemporal requirements of the COMPASS chromatin complex to mediate longevity and its
effectors such as CRTC-1, SREBP1/SBP-1 and mTOR targets. To complement these studies, Aim 2 will identify
the downstream molecular mechanisms and metabolic changes that a specific function of CRTC-1 regulates to
promote H3K4me3-dependent longevity. The independent R00 phase will focus on studying transgenerational
mechanisms downstream of the COMPASS-mTOR-CRTC pathway to promote longevity. The conservation of
all these components will allow me here to translate these findings into mammalian systems to identify the cellular
and physiological responses that epigenetic modifications control to promote longevity. Together, these findings
will serve as the foundation of my research program and will launch the beginning of my independent research
career. My primary mentor, Dr. William Mair will provide important scientific and career guidance to ensure my
success. My advisors and collaborators complement Dr. Mair’s expertise and will help me reach my career and
research goals. The K99/R00 award constitutes a unique opportunity for my advance in the academic track. It
will help me to consolidate an innovative niche in the study of epigenetics of aging and provide me with the
necessary academic and technical training to launch my career as an independent investigator."

There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the temporal dynamics underlying the auditory-motor
integration deficits consistently observed in children and adults who stutter. Fluent speech requires coordinated
neuronal activity that is achieved through neural oscillatory synchrony across brain structures. This proposal will
focus on the oscillatory synchrony facilitating neural communication within the speech network. Our long-term
goal is to determine empirically-based neural markers for persistent stuttering, findings that may eventually
inform the clinical diagnosis and treatment of childhood stuttering. The overall objective of the present
application is to determine how children who stutter (CWS) differ from fluent peers in neural oscillatory synchrony
across auditory-motor structures during speech perception and planning. Guided by EEG and MRI data collected
from children who do and do not stutter, our central hypothesis is that beta oscillations, which control predictive
timing of movements through coordination of motor to auditory systems, will show aberrant power, reduced inter-
trial phase clustering, and reduced interregional oscillatory phase synchrony in CWS. A better understanding in
this area has exciting treatment implications, since manipulation of synchrony within oscillatory patterns in
auditory-motor systems may be possible through entrainment with external sensory stimuli and non-invasive
brain stimulation. This project will thus allow us to lay the groundwork towards systematic, neurobiology-based
intervention development for CWS. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypotheses will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1. Identify and characterize beta power and oscillatory synchrony in auditory-
motor cortical areas during speech perception and planning in CWS. 2. Compare beta power and oscillatory
synchrony in auditory-motor cortical areas during natural and entrained (paced) speech planning in CWS. 3.
Determine how beta oscillation characteristics in auditory-motor areas relate to structural and functional
connectivity among auditory, motor and striatal regions in CWS. The proposed work is innovative, as it will be
the first series of studies designed to characterize neural oscillatory synchrony specific to speech processing in
CWS, which may serve as a highly predictive neural marker for persistent stuttering during early childhood.
Findings will be significant, because the expected results will elucidate, for the first time, causal mechanisms
behind auditory-motor integration deficits in persistent stuttering. Such results will have an important positive
impact, as the identified neural mechanisms underlying fluent speech will lay the foundation for effective early
intervention for stuttering."

Glioblastoma (GBM) continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy with limited treatment options. Our
laboratory studies tumor metabolism and its potential to serve as a novel therapeutic target. Through a series
of investigations, our group has identified that the diverse tumor ecology implicit in this malignancy contributes
to considerable intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity and dynamic metabolic reprogramming, allowing GBM
cells to adapt and proliferate under diverse, microenvironmental stresses. Specifically, through integrative
cross-platform analyses coupling metabolomics with genomics in patient-derived tumors, we identified
enhanced fatty acid oxidization (FAO) as a metabolic node in GBM driven by a transcriptional program
designed to import and utilize fatty acids from the tumor microenvironment. This metabolic phenotype was
specific to the mesenchymal subtype in GBM and recapitulated in preclinical models. Functional analyses
uncovered specific roles these fatty acids play in gliomagenesis, which are dependent upon nutrient
availability. In a state of glucose deprivation, mesenchymal GBM cells utilize these exogenous fatty acids to
serve as a vital, alternate source of ATP, whereas in nutrient favorable conditions, the intermediary metabolism
of FAO acts as a metabolic cue to drive a transcriptional program supporting cellular proliferation and
mesenchymal differentiation. Accordingly, inhibiting FAO in standard, nutrient rich conditions led to decreased
proliferation, however, robust energetic stress and non-apoptotic cell death was observed in mesenchymal
GBM cells in the context of glucose deprivation. In this application, we propose to extend these promising
findings by defining molecular mechanisms governing enhanced FAO in GBM (Aim 1), delineating the multiple
roles FAO may play in gliomagenesis in the context of this tumor’s diverse tumor ecology (Aim 2), and evaluate
the translational potential for eliciting metabolic synthetic lethality in GBM through energetic stress (Aim 3)."

The objective of this proposal is to create a new kind of ﬂexible ureteroscope that transforms nearly instanta-
neously from endoscope to large-lumen steerable suction catheter to enable rapid removal of large kidney stone
volumes, sparing patients from invasive alternatives.
Clinical signiﬁcance comes from the 3.5 million patients who suffer from kidney stones each year in the
USA alone, 700,000 of whom have interventional procedures done to remove the stones. 230,000 of these
people have larger kidney stone volumes, and thus are subject to either invasive surgery or excessively long
ureteroscopy, with its increased complication rates and excessive procedure durations. Our central hypothesis is
that our new transformable ureteroscope will reduce the procedure time by 36 minutes or more for patients with
large stone volumes. Reducing procedure duration by this much will make larger stone times equivalent to small
stone times, making many more patients candidates for minimally invasive interventions.
Innovation comes from a new mechanical actuation concept that enables us to build bending actuation directly
into the outer wall of the device itself. This enables an open central lumen that is nearly as large in diameter
as the endoscope itself. The lumen initially carries a camera/illumination core that can be removed whenever
desired to transform the device into a steerable suction sheath. To build bending actuation into the outer wall,
we harness elastic interactions in asymmetrically stiff, thin-walled tubes. After attaching these tubes at their tips,
tip bending can be created through small relative linear displacement at the tube bases. The result is a highly
dexterous device with the same bending capabilities of a ureteroscope that has a large central lumen for high
volume stone removal via suction.
Our approach in Aim 1 is to design, optimize and build an OR-ready version of our steerable sheath and
insertable camera/illumination core using scalable manufacturing processes and clinical-grade, biocompatible
materials. The goal of Aim 2 is to create the user interface of the steerable section and the removable cam-
era module, culminating in a low-volume production run with production-equivalent materials, and to perform
comprehensive formative human factors evaluations of the Aspire system. Aim 3 focuses on statistically pow-
ered experiments to evaluate our hypotheses that our new steerable suction scope will reduce average surgical
duration by 38%, while also demonstrating a reduction in surgical duration of very large stones and improv-
ing stone-free rates. This will bring times and stone free rates for patients with larger stones in line with the
current (small stone) standard of care, so that they can be treated within clinical guidelines for maximum safe
ureteroscopy duration. Success in validating these hypotheses will strongly motivate future Phase III activities
(supported by private capital after the conclusion of this Phase II SBIR) where we complete the FDA 510(k)
clearance process, and launch our device on the market."

There is an increasing trend for children with ASD with primary behavioral challenges to be hospitalized in
medical facilities because accessible behavioral support resources are not available in local communities.
Unfortunately, most community-based hospitals are not well equipped to meet optimal behavioral care with
families consequently experiencing prolonged/protracted hospitalizations where behaviors may not be
adequately treated and could potentially worsen. Further, the specific inability to adequately respond to
challenging behaviors may limit the ability of children to be accepted into step-down facilities or return home
safely and contribute to extremely stressful aspects of care. Prolonged hospitalizations also result in significant
negative financial return for hospitals (un/under-reimbursement). In prior work, deploying a specialized brief
Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) assessment and intervention explicitly designed for use during
hospitalizations demonstrated improvements in challenging behaviors, decreases in restraint and staffing, and
high levels of family satisfaction. Unfortunately, community access to this type of intervention is extremely
limited by geographic location and provider availability. Appropriate telehealth and digital health systems that
can facilitate tele-mediated support may hold great potential for increasing the availability of such care to
children, families, and the providers and hospitals responsible for their care. While many technologies for real-
time video conferencing are available (e.g. zoom), in order to be able to accurately support understanding of

flagging, and efficient communication of key behaviors across human support teams (both expert and non-
expert) over substantial periods of time (including when experts are not present) are needed to enable
meaningful telemediated ABA service. The current project creates and tests the potential clinical value of an
innovative telehealth platform to facilitate appropriate, efficacious ABA tele-assessment and intervention for
adolescents with ASD displaying challenging behaviors during hospitalizations and post-discharge transition.
In the first phase of this work, we propose co-design of the novel system with key stakeholders and feasibility
testing to demonstrate both technical capacity and potential clinical value. In the second phase of this work,
we hone the systems commercial value and conduct a rigorous trial to demonstrate clinical utility and financial
return for children, families, systems of care, and payers."

Title Filtration Media for In-Home PFAS Removal from Drinking Water
SBIR Phase II Application
P.I.: Steven Dietz, TDA Research, Inc.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also commonly known as perfluorinated compounds, are a large family
of man-made, globally distributed chemicals that have been used for decades. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are the most common PFAS, but thousands of other derivatives exist. PFAS have
been widely used in consumer products such as non-stick cookware (Teflon®), carpets and carpet treatment products
(Scotchgard®), food packaging, aqueous firefighting foams, hydraulic aviation fuels and in the aerospace,
automotive, construction, and electronics industries. PFAS are emerging environmental pollutants in groundwater,
and they are attracting significant attention due to their global distribution, persistence, toxicity and tendency to bio-
accumulate. PFAS contamination has been found in more than 1400 locations in 49 states and the EPA estimates that
the drinking water of more than 110 million Americans may already be contaminated. Once released into the
environment, they are not easily broken down by air, water, or sunlight. Thus, people can be exposed to PFAS that
were manufactured decades in the past. PFAS can travel long distances in the air and water, exposing people to PFAS
manufactured or emitted from facilities many miles away. Human exposure can also occur through contact with
products containing PFAS. In 2016, EPA established a lifetime health advisory (LHA) level of 70 parts per trillion
(ppt) for individual or combined concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and many states are establishing even
lower levels. Epidemiological studies have shown that the occurrence of PFAS in humans is linked to thyroid disease,
high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Current
water treatment technologies that can meet the EPA targets are not cost effective, especially for in-home use,
necessitating a need for technology/advanced materials to cleanup drinking water that are efficient, cost effective and
can meet the current EPA target of 70 ppt, the new lower New York state limit of 10 ppt and the likely even stricter
regulations that will follow.
TDA Research, Inc (TDA) proposes to develop an adsorption-based system for removing PFAS from drinking water
down to EPA prescribed limits of 70 ppt (parts per trillion) or lower. The key to such a system is a low cost, high
capacity adsorbent with fast kinetics to remove PFAS. TDA's sorbent uses a mesoporous carbon structure grafted
with Lewis base functionalized groups to remove PFAS via physical adsorption. The mesopores provides very fast
adsorption kinetics and accessibility to the functionalized adsorption sites. The strength of the Lewis acid-base
interaction can be tuned to allow the sorbent to be effective even in the presence of the multiple contaminants found
in drinking water. The fast adsorption and high PFAS capacity of the sorbent will reduce the system size and enable
their use in smaller home-based systems.

Yearly influenza epidemics strike millions of people, causing up to 500,000 deaths. Fatality caused by most
seasonal influenza viruses is <0.03%, but with significant mortality in the young and the elderly populations.
When a new pathogenic influenza strain enters the population, a pandemic could kill tens of millions of people
with a negative economic impact estimated to be over 150 billion dollars. Due to the incomplete efficacy of the
current vaccines, effective drug treatment is necessary. Presently, influenza treatment is only somewhat
effective, and some influenza strains are resistant to the currently marketed therapeutics, adamantanes and the
neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu®. However, while zanamivir (ZAN, Relenza®) remains highly active against
oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains, its therapeutic impact is severely limited by its route of administration, via
oral inhalation, which renders it unsuitable for patients with a compromised respiratory system. Therefore,
development of a novel delivery alternative for ZAN as we propose here, is poised to address a significant unmet
medical need.
Transdermal drug delivery offers a number of improvements over other delivery systems. The drug directly enters
the systemic circulation, circumventing absorption and first-pass barriers typical for oral delivery. It avoids skin
puncture by syringe needles, eliminating pain and patient visits to a clinician. Transdermal delivery of ZAN could
allow large numbers of patients to be reached during an influenza outbreak, which will be particularly important
in light of the added risk during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While ZAN itself cannot cross the human skin
barrier at therapeutic rates, MicroArray Patch (MAP) - enhanced transdermal delivery is an elegant, efficient,
and painless method for increasing the skin permeation of many drugs, including ZAN. Our novel drug-device
combination product, TSR-066, consists of a swellable microneedle array, which will continuously deliver ZAN
from a specially formulated reservoir over 5 days. This Fast-Track SBIR proposal will support optimization of the
MAP with a focus on the applicator component and subsequent manufacturing of supplies for the Phase I clinical
study. We have obtained agreement with the FDA on the preclinical studies needed in order to open the IND, as
well as on the Phase I clinical development plans and the 505(b)2 regulatory strategy. In addition to the
experimental work proposed here, we are developing a robust IP expansion strategy for TSR-066, as well as
future product candidates that stand to benefit from MAP-enabled delivery.
The end result of this work will be a novel, transdermal delivery approach for ZAN, which will expand its reach
into patient groups for which Relenza® is contraindicated and allow for simple administration of ZAN for both
treatment and prevention of the flu. We have assembled a team of expert advisors and collaborators to ensure
successful completion of this research plan."

Background: Both sex and gender have profound effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence and
associated risk factors. Differences in CVD between men and women are often attributed to biologic sex, such
as hormones, but all individuals are also deeply affected by the gender norms and expectations of their
society. However, few studies have examined the impact of gender on CVD. The impact of gender can be
measured in part through gender-related variables (GRV) classified in the domains of gender roles, gender
relations, gender identity, institutionalized gender, discrimination, and behavioral/lifestyle risk factors.
Integrating the impact of both biologic sex and sociocultural gender, metabolomic profiles capture the
downstream effects of genomic as well as environmental factors. Our research group, and others have
characterized metabolomic profiles associated with CVD. However, no studies have examined the impact of
gender on the metabolome, which may offer clues about biologic mechanistic pathways related to gender.
Goal: We will examine the intersection of sex and gender on CVD and the metabolome through sex-based
comparisons of the effects of gender on CVD. We will attempt to separate the impact of sex and gender
through sex-stratified evaluation of gender effects on the metabolome and subsequent CVD risk, to better
understand the health impacts of gender, particularly in women.
Setting: We have assembled an exceptional team with deep expertise in women's health, cardiovascular
disease outcomes, metabolomics, and biostatistics/ bioinformatics.
Research Plan: Our aims leverage three large, unique cohorts: (1) the UK Biobank (UKB) including 502,386
men and women, 118,014 with metabolomics; (2) the Women's Health Initiative including 93,676 women in the
Observational Study (WHI-OS) and 2306 with metabolomics in a CHD case-control study (WHI-CHD) that
includes OS and hormone trial (HT) participants; and the (3) Nurses' Health Studies: NHS1 with 121,700
women and 908 with metabolomics (NHS-stroke), and NHS2 with 116,430 women. We will examine the
association of GRVs and a composite gender score (GS) with metabolomic profiles and with CVD outcomes.
The GS will be derived in the UKB and tested for association with CVD outcomes in UKB by sex and
generation, as well as compared to associations with CVD in the WHI-OS, NHS1 and NHS2. Moreover, we will
evaluate the relationship between gender score and GRV with metabolomic profiles, and their association with
CVD.
Relevance to Public Health: This research will improve our understanding of the impact of gender and the
intersection of sex and gender, on CVD and the metabolome. Evaluating the impact of gender in women
through GRV and relating these with the metabolome and cardiovascular outcomes will advance our
understanding of the impact of gender on health and may inform CVD prevention strategies."

Th17 cells play important roles in adaptive immunity and autoimmune diseases. In normal physiological
conditions, Th17 cells produce IL-17A and IL-17F to protect the mucosa from bacterial and fungal infections.
Dysregulation of Th17 cells, however, is responsible for inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis. Differentiation of Th17 cell lineage has been investigated intensively and has yielded
significant results. The cooperation of key transcriptional factors such as Irf4, Batf, Stat3 together with lineage-
specific regulator RorgT defines the transcriptional program and function of Th17 cells. These regulatory
networks are induced by IL-6 and TGF-b1, and further IL-23 signaling pathways promote the development of
pathogenic Th17 cells. To identify Th17-specific regulators, we recently conducted comprehensive ChIP-seq
and RNA-seq studies of Th17 cells and discovered Class IIa Hdacs Hdac4 and Hdac7 as candidates that are
transcriptionally regulated by Stat3 and BET proteins. We further found that Hdac4 and Hdac7 co-localize with
distinct transcription factors JunB and Bhlhe40 on cis-regulatory regions of genes, to activate Th17 pathogenic
genes (Il23r, Tgfb3, Il22, Csf2) and repress regulatory gene (Il10), respectively, during pathogenic Th17 cell
differentiation (IL-6+IL-23+IL-1b). However, we still have limited mechanistic understanding how Hdac4 and
Hdac7 function distinctly in pathogenic Th17 cell development. It is also unclear how Hdac4 and Hdac7
facilitate Th17 pathogenicity through the regulation of Th17 cell maintenance and/or plasticity in colitis. We
therefore aim to delineate the role of Hdac4 and Hdac7 in Th17 cell-mediated inflammation, and establish the
feasibility of pharmacological inhibition of Hdac4 and/or Hdac7 as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat Th17-
related colitis."
10758219,"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is one of the most popular resources for dealing with alcohol-related problems,
and 12-step therapy (TS), based upon AA doctrine and practice, is one of the prevailing alcohol treatment
approaches in the United States. Two large multisite trials, one high in internal validity (PMRG, 1997) and the
second high in external validity (VA Substance Abuse Treatment Study; Quimette, 1997) came to the same
conclusion, TS was equally effective as more research supported therapies, and may actually be superior
when total abstinence is the treatment goal. A primary objective of TS is to facilitate AA affiliation and strong
evidence suggests that this aim is a major factor accounting for the effectiveness of TS (e.g., Tonigan, 2005).
High priority has therefore been assigned to the investigation of what actually occurs in AA, with a special
focus on identifying prescribed AA behaviors and processes that are predictive of drinking reduction. The
guiding assumption of these efforts is that the key to improve TS is to first understand AA better. To this end,
this study will generate, for the first time, a comprehensive and definitive process model of AA-related behavior
change. This objective will be realized through the highly innovative use of EMA data collection among early
AA affiliates. Using real-time daily data, aim 1 will determine if four MOBC identified by AA researchers (gains
in social support, increased abstinence self-efficacy, spiritual practices, and negative urgency) mediate the
linkage between three types of AA prescribed behaviors and drinking outcome. Noteworthy, these analyses will
include the first rigorous testing of six of seven of Kazdin's (2007) criteria to confirm (or reject) that these four
statistical mediators are MOBC. Aim 2 will investigate whether the actions of the AA active ingredients on
mediators (a path) and the actions of the mediators (b path) are constant over time or, alternatively, if there are
critical periods of influence. Last, aim 3 will determine if the four MOBC operate differently across distinct
subpopulations. To achieve study aims, we propose a two-group randomized longitudinal study (N = 190). In
one group (n = 130) we will collect 6-months of continuous EMA data, allowing us to examine near real-time
associations between AA active ingredients in three domains, four MOBC, and drinking. In tandem, we will also
conduct in-person interviews at baseline, 3, and 6-months. Assessment reactivity is a concern, especially so
because this will be the first study to use EMA in addition to in-person interviews in AA research. We will
therefore include a traditional fixed assessment group (n = 60) also interviewed at baseline, 3, and 6-months to
identify potential measurement biases introduced in our innovative approach. Achievement of study aims will
generate the first empirically validated AA process model that will inform TS with critical information for
improving treatment outcomes."

A conceptual and empirical revolution is occurring in our understanding of the eukaryotic heat-shock response.
Heat shock has long been conceived of as a proteotoxic stress, triggering formation of toxic aggregates of
denatured proteins, which must be cleaned up by induced heat shock proteins. Recent results from our group
and others have established a complementary paradigm: temperature acts as a physiological signal, triggering
the adaptive formation of biomolecular condensates with specific cellular functions, and the condensation
process is regulated by heat shock proteins. Crucially, in the proteotoxic model, aggregates are trash, but in the
adaptive condensation model, they are functional treasure. Using an integrated set of biochemical, cell biological,
and evolutionary approaches established over the past decade, we are pursuing three linked areas: 1) identifying
and dissecting the cellular functions of particular heat-shock and stress-induced condensates of protein and
mRNA; 2) studying the regulation of condensation and dispersal, focusing on the specificity of physiological
condensates and their remodeling and reversal by stress-induced molecular chaperones; and 3) probing the
sensation and transduction of temperature into adaptive responses in fungi which rely on warm-blooded hosts
for growth or dispersal, and in the temperature-dependent activation of cells in the vertebrate immune system
during fever. In addition to fundamental insights into the operation and organization of eukaryotic cells, these
studies promise to shed light on intracellular aggregation processes known to be dysregulated during
neurodegenerative disease, uncover new mechanisms for the control of fungi, and provide new molecular insight
into how fever promotes immune-cell activation."
10923988,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures are estimated to rise by over 300% by the year 2030. Periprosthetic
joint infection (PJI) is the most significant complication following TJA with healthcare costs exceeding $1.6 billion
annually. Treatment of PJI generally requires surgical intervention combined with a prolonged course of
antibiotics costing $50,000 per patient. Despite this aggressive treatment, treatment is only successful in half of
patients. The leading cause of treatment failure in PJI is the formation of protective bacterial biofilms or
communities of bacteria encased within an extracellular matrix which are tolerant to commercially available
antibiotics. We have discovered that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) displays both antibacterial and antibiofilm
properties. Nevertheless, there is tremendous variability in the literature on the clinical efficacy of PRP. To
overcome this variability, we have developed a PRP-derived biologic that is specifically formulated with high
antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity with little to no lot-to-lot variability, termed BIO-PLY™. In an equine
model of native joint infection, BIO-PLY™ not only decreased intraarticular bacterial load but also dampened
inflammation and protected venerable cartilage from damage. In this proposal, we will capitalize on the equine
model of native joint infection to manufacture a human equivalent and evaluate the safety and efficacy of human
BIO-PLY™ using established in vitro and in vivo models of PJI. The goal of this proposal is to generate the key
data necessary for a go/no-go decision to advance BIO-PLY™ toward a Phase II pre-clinical animal model and
an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Federal Drug Administration."

Epidemiologic models have predicted that by 2040, 27% of the population living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) will be 50 years of age or older; however, these models appear to underestimate both the timing and
magnitude of the age shift. As of 2022, 21% of all people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in countries supported
by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are 50 years of age and older. As the HIV epidemic in SSA
comes under control—with more people living with HIV (PLWH) diagnosed, placed on ART, and achieving viral
suppression—updated models are needed to more accurately predict and plan for coming demands on the
HIV-related healthcare system.
The burden of HIV-associated noncommunicable diseases (NCD) is well documented, and risk rises markedly
with age. With increases in life expectancy among PLWH, healthcare resource limitations, increased focus on
integrating NCD management into HIV platforms, and the imperative to achieve and sustain HIV control in all
subpopulations, models that accurately capture and predict the age distribution and NCD burden of PLWH are
critical to address knowledge gaps and support precision program implementation.
We posit that countries in SSA with high HIV burden will experience the shift in the age distribution to greater
than 50% of PLWH over the age of 50 at least a decade sooner than predicted by more commonly used
models. Botswana and Zambia are two settings with different epidemic characteristics, providing a unique
opportunity to develop and test a new demographic prediction model for more accurate prediction of this “silver
tsunami” in PLWH and NCD burden. The goal of this study is to use repeated nationally representative
data from Botswana and Zambia to develop a cohort model with age-stratified transmission risk that
predicts the age distribution and NCD burden among PLWH through 2050.
The proposed Epidemiologic Predictions to Inform Programs for Long-term Aging Needs among people living
with HIV (EPI-PLAN HIV) project will generate a framework for accurate prediction of both the age shift and
NCD risk in aging populations of PLWH through the following aims 1) Characterize sexual networks in
Botswana and Zambia using repeated HIV population-based survey data, 2) Build a cohort model with age-
stratified HIV transmission risk to predict the age distribution among PLWH over time, and 3) Predict the
burden of NCD among PLWH in Botswana and Zambia over time. The outcomes of this project will be used to
accelerate the health system's response and serve as the foundation for future research into the growing
burden of NCD in PLWH in SSA."
10747309,"Emerging evidence implies that protein acetyltransferases play a crucial role in diverse
biological processes and various human diseases including cancer. Protein N-terminal
acetyltransferase D (NatD), also known as Naa40, Nat4, or Patt1, is a unique member of protein
N-terminal acetyltransferases because it only acetylates histones H2A and H4 that share the
identical N-terminal sequence of SGRGK. NatD has been reported to play an important role in a
variety of processes including remodeling of chromatin structure, cell migration and invasion, and
apoptosis. The elevated level of NatD in human lung and colorectal cancer tissues correlates with
poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, loss of NatD suppresses human lung cancer cell invasion and
decreases the tumor growth in colorectal cancer xenograft mice models. Hence, we hypothesize
that NatD is a compelling target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics for lung and
colorectal cancers. However, there are no specific small molecule probes available for NatD to
decipher the functions of NatD acetyltransferase activity in cancer. To fill this gap, our long-term
goal is to discover novel, potent, and selective small molecule NatD inhibitors. For this application,
we will employ a series of facile and reproducible high-throughput screening (HTS) assays with
orthogonal readouts to screen 400,000 diverse compounds from selected chemical libraries at
the Chemical Genomics Facility at Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery. Then we will characterize
active compounds in structural, mechanistic, selectivity, and cell-based studies. Upon completion
of this project, we expect to identify potent and selective first-in-class NatD small molecule
inhibitors as chemical probes for NatD function in cells. The knowledge gained from this project
would expedite the development of NatD modulators and our understanding of NatD-regulated
pathways in cancer patients."
10763872,"Aphasia is a language disorder commonly caused by stroke and other acquired brain injuries that affects over
two million people in the US and has a large negative effect on quality of life. Anomia (i.e., word-finding
difficulty) is a primary frustration for people with aphasia, and naming treatments for anomia are both widely
researched and commonly used in clinical practice. For naming treatments to make a meaningful impact on the
lives of people with aphasia, they must produce durable gains in word-finding which generalize beyond the
treatment context. However, most theoretically-motivated naming treatment research fails to address the long-
term retention of trained words and their generalization to connected speech, limiting their clinical impact.
 Prevailing learning theory suggests that “desirable difficulty” improves treatment retention and
generalization. The current proposal therefore seeks to improve the durability and context generalization of
computer-based naming treatment by incorporating model-based algorithms to adaptively maintain desirable
difficulty. We will test two distinct models in parallel clinical trials. Our central premise is that these models will
facilitate a balance between what have historically been framed as contrasting learning approaches: errorless
learning vs. effortful retrieval (Study 1) and massed vs. distributed practice (Study 2). Instead, our models will
integrate these approaches by replacing extreme static contrasts with continuous task components which can
be adaptively modified based on ongoing patient performance. Study 1 will adaptively balance effort and
accuracy using speeded naming deadlines based on a model we have developed which characterizes
individuals’ speed-accuracy tradeoffs in picture naming over time. Study 2 will manipulate trial spacing using
an adaptive scheduling and memory decay model built into widely available, open-source flashcard software.
 In both studies, we predict that when compared to matched traditional non-adaptive treatment
conditions, our adaptive conditions will produce more successful retention of trained words 3 and 6 months
post-treatment on naming probes (Aims 1a, 2a), and better context generalization to connected speech when
tested on complex scene descriptions containing untrained exemplars of trained words (Aims 1b, 2b). We also
predict that adaptive trial spacing in Study 2 will successfully train many more words than is possible in current
standard care. In addition, data generated in Studies 1 and 2 will be used to develop the next generation of
adaptive timing models (Aims 1c and 2c), spurring future innovations in personalized medicine.
Successful clinical trial outcomes will demonstrate that adaptive computer-based naming treatments provide a
novel way to produce large, durable, and generalizable treatment gains, and positive Study 2 findings could be
immediately implemented in clinical practice at scale using free open-source software. Successful modeling
outcomes will lead to even more effective interventions and lay the groundwork for a transformative research
agenda that could ultimately lead to comprehensive adaptive learning systems for aphasia rehabilitation."

conduct of patient-oriented cardiovascular disease (CVD) research in East Africa, and to conduct a new study
of novel biomarkers predicting the onset of diastolic dysfunction of the heart (Aim 1). The candidate has lived
and conducted research in Tanzania for the past 15 years. He helped to establish a new medical college and
developed longstanding partnerships with leading research organizations in Tanzania (MITU) and Kenya
(KWTRP). These partnerships, with the ongoing research studies, provide him with an outstanding research
environment to study CVD in the context of Africa while also training a cadre of young investigators. The
training that he offers leverage 3 NIH R01 funded projects in Tanzania (Aims 2-4), foundation awards (Aim 5),
and a newly funded CVD research project in Kenya (Aim 6). United States (US) trainees from Weill Cornell
Medicine will be supported by NIH T32 training grants and spend ~50% of their time at research sites in East
Africa, which have longstanding international collaborators and excellent research training environments. East
African trainees will be supported by two NIH D43 training grants and institutional funds. The common theme is
that all of the research projects have patient-oriented research on CVD as the focus, with an emphasis on
interactions with HIV, and will serve as vehicles for mentored research training. The specific aims include:
1. Biomarkers for incident diastolic dysfunction in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Tanzania
2. HIV, sleep, nocturnal blood pressure, and CVD in Tanzania
3. A cluster randomized trial of engaging religious leaders to reduce blood pressure in Tanzania
4. Reducing post-hospital mortality related to severe hypertension in Tanzania
5. Causes and consequences of hypertension in adolescents in Tanzania
6. Point-of-care risk stratification for community-centered hypertension treatment in Kenya
The focus of research training will be on a diverse pool of clinical trainees, ranging from residents to fellows to
clinical faculty. The candidate has a strong track record of mentoring patient-oriented researchers in Tanzania
and participates in multiple private and NIH sponsored research fellowships at Weill Cornell. Trainees will
participate in research projects in Tanzania (Aims 1-5) and also in Kenya (Aim 6). Trainees learn through the
conduct of their mentored research project and partnerships with colleagues from the US and East Africa on
related studies. The K24 award will enable the candidate to decrease his administrative responsibilities and
commit at least 25% effort to CVD research mentorship of US and Tanzanian trainees. As part of the K24, he
will pursue formal training in mentorship as well as strengthening his skills in translational biomarker research."
10763883,"Abstract
The sense of taste is a complex and integrative chemosensory system that guides consummatory behavior. Taste
receptor cells (TRCs) in the taste bud are continuously renewed and must reconnect with peripheral gustatory
neurons (GNs) to relay taste signals to the brain. The turnover and re-establishment of peripheral taste synapses
is vital to maintain this complex sensory system. Studies have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms
governing the differentiation, maturation and turnover of TRCs as well as the identification of molecularly and
functionally separate populations of geniculate ganglion neurons. However, the synaptic connectivity and
dynamics between TRCs and GNs remains unknown due to the lack of technologies to examine them. To
overcome this, I have developed GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) to visualize synaptic
contacts in the taste bud. GRASP consists of pre- and post-GRASP split GFP molecules expressed, directed, and
anchored into the synaptic membranes of pre- and post-synaptic cells, respectively. Because expression of the
GRASP components can be controlled genetically, we can use it to assess the connectivity of specific populations.
Moreover, GRASP produces bright fluorescent signals in native tissues which grants the unique ability to study
synapse dynamics in time-lapse studies. In preliminary work, I have created transgenic mice that express the
cyan variant of the pre-GRASP protein under the PKD2L1 promoter, a marker for sour TRCs. Additionally, I have
engineered Flex-switch post-GRASP AAVs which enables us to express the post-synaptic GRASP in GNs. With
this novel technique at hand, my goal is to genetically identify potential GN-TRC synaptic partners and to
characterize synaptic dynamics during taste cell turnover, using sour TRCs as a model. To achieve these goals,
this proposal will investigate two aims, 1) Identify synaptic partners for sour TRCs in the fungiform,
circumvallate, and laryngeal taste buds, and 2) Determine the longevity and dynamics of sour TRC synapses over
time. This proposal is designed to use GRASP, a novel and innovative technique, to elucidate synaptic
connectivity and dynamics in the peripheral taste system, which will have far-reaching impact in the fields of
taste development, connectivity, and taste disorders."
10931507,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer. Treatment options are limited, in part because of
inefficient drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). GBM microenvironment contributes to malignant
growth, invasion, and escape from immune surveillance. We will develop a radically new strategy of GBM
treatment by simultaneous targeting of tumor microenvironment and activating brain cancer privileged immune
system. This new combination approach aims to regulate tumor microenvironment components that are largely
independent of heterogeneous genetic mutations in glioblastoma. It has potential advantage over conventional
GBM treatment with small molecule drugs, radiation and targeted molecular marker(s) inhibition. In the frame of
the FOA ""Toward Translation of Cancer Nanotechnology Interventions"", we will develop the translation of cancer
interventions using novel nanomedicines able to cross biobarriers, such as BBB, cell and endosomal membranes,
and modulate tumor microenvironment for effective therapy that may treat not only brain primary tumors (GBM)
but other poorly treatable brain secondary/metastatic tumors.
We plan to understand the interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM) protein laminin-411 (a4b1g1)
expression and brain local immune system as parts of GBM-promoting immunosuppressive microenvironment.
Our clinical data on 130 GBM patients showed that tumor laminin-411 correlated with tumor aggressiveness,
poor patient survival and early recurrence. We developed nano drugs based on natural polymer, poly(β-L-malic
acid), able to block the synthesis of trimer protein laminin-411 in vivo. We also used syngeneic mouse models
treated with nano immuno drugs delivering to GBM checkpoint inhibitor antibodies anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 that
in free form do not cross BBB, which increased animal survival. Nanodrugs were well characterized and non-
toxic in mice and rabbits (collaboration with Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory). Nano polymeric drugs
production was scaled up to grams. Toxicity and PK studies were successfully performed on primates,
male/female Cynomolgus macaques using therapeutic 1X and acute 10X intravenous dosages.
We also developed a nano immuno delivery system on the same platform bearing anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1
antibodies that traversed BBB, activated local brain immune system and prolonged animal survival. New
preliminary data demonstrate that laminin-411 regulates Notch pathway and activation of NK, NKT, IFNg+ NKT,
and macrophages, whereas checkpoint inhibitors delivered to the brain on nanoplatform regulate both innate
and adaptive immune system. Our translational research is geared towards developing clinically suitable
combinations of BBB-crossing nanomedicines for efficient glioma treatment.
Aim 1. Synthesis of novel nano drug variants for combination brain cancer therapy. Aim 2. Lead nano drug testing
for glioma treatment efficacy. Aim 3. Pharmacological (PK, PD) and toxicological examination of lead nano
immunopolymers."
10745320,"SUMMARY
At the global population level, seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) evolution is characterized by repeated selective
sweeps in which novel antigenic variants that escape antibody responses replace previously circulating strains.
Despite this clear pattern at a population level, selection of antigenic variants is not typically seen within
individuals with acute IAV infection. This apparent disconnect between evolutionary processes at population and
within-host scales contributes to the challenge of predicting evolutionary outcomes. The processes that impede
IAV selection within the host, and their potency, have not been examined systematically. To address this
knowledge gap, we will test the central hypothesis that the genetic structure of within-host viral populations plays
a major role in defining the likelihood that a beneficial mutation becomes fixed. In particular, we hypothesize that
the fate of a highly fit variant virus is shaped by its initial prevalence in the inoculum (quantitative structure), the
timing with which it arises de novo (temporal structure), its location within the infected tissue (spatial structure)
and the presence or absence of competing variants (clonal interference). In turn, we predict that onward
transmission of a beneficial variant will rely on a combination of these factors and the stringency of the
transmission bottleneck. We furthermore propose that the severity of the bottleneck is modulated by pre-existing
immunity in the host. To test these hypotheses, we will monitor the dynamics of mixed viral populations
containing a seasonal IAV and one or two HA antigenic variants thereof within individual guinea pigs and between
transmission partners. Partial immunity will be induced with vaccination to yield a model in which the antigenic
variants have a selective advantage. Distinct sequence barcodes will be included in the HA and NA genes of
each virus to allow sensitive detection of genetic bottlenecks. Tracking barcodes in both HA and NA will allow
genetic linkage to be assessed. The wild type and antigenic variant viruses will be combined in vivo with various
quantitative, temporal and spatial structures and then barcode dynamics will be monitored by sequencing. With
this approach, we will perform a systematic evaluation of the consequences of population genetic structure for
viral evolutionary dynamics. This well-controlled and systematic approach will allow identification of processes
that impede selection within and between individual hosts, providing much needed insight into the forces shaping
IAV evolution where it begins."

as well as by lower rates of durable responses. While CRS is related to extreme elevation of cytokines
associated with T cell expansion, the exact etiology of neurotoxicity is unknown and no options for treatment of
neurotoxicity are available. It has, however, become apparent that inhibitory myeloid cells and cytokines
contribute to both CART cell toxicities and resistance. We have identified granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a dominant driver for CART cell toxicity and inhibition of their functions. Our
robust preclinical data indicate that GM-CSF inhibition reduces monocyte activation, enhances CART cell
functions and prevents the development of both CRS and neurotoxicity in a novel xenograft model for CART
cell-associated toxicities. Our additional studies suggest that GM-CSF disruption in CART cells ameliorates
their apoptosis, independent of its effect on myeloid cells. These findings were corroborated when we utilized
GM-CSF depletion as a therapeutic strategy in patients with cytokine storm and severe Coronavirus Disease
2019, COVID-19. Based on this work, a Phase 1/2 multi-center study of GM-CSF neutralization after CART19
cell therapy was launched. Our central hypothesis is that depletion of GM-CSF results in modulation of myeloid
cell behavior, amelioration of CART cell activation, reduction of CART cell associated toxicities, and
enhancement of their efficacy. We will leverage our laboratory tools, novel preclinical models, and samples
from this clinical trial to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1 of this project, we will examine the interactions between
GM-CSF and monocytes after CART cell therapy. In Aim 2 of this project, we will study the effect of GM-CSF
directly on CART cells, and Aim 3 will test how these changes affect toxicity and efficacy of CART19 cell
therapy in the novel Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Completion of these Aims will identify novel insights into the toxicity
and activity of CART cells and will develop a new strategy to prevent CART cell associated neurotoxicity and
CRS, potentially enabling the outpatient administration of CART cell therapy."

This is a renewal application to the previous International Health Ethics Training program award
(R25TW009730 PD Nelson Sewankambo), that is currently in a no-cost extension period till
December 2019. The program has focused on increasing capacity mainly at Master’s degree level and
short courses for professionals, researchers and students. This new application is entitled, “Sustain:
Advancing Makerere University Masters Bioethics training”. Its major focus is sustainability and builds on
the achievements, challenges and lessons learned from the above program, while taking into consideration
a) the rapidly increasing external research funding in Uganda b) the increasing focus on research ethics
education at masters, PhD and post-doctoral levels, c) the improved national and institutional regulatory
research ethics mechanisms and d) the more than 30-year longstanding research collaborations between
Ugandan and foreign researchers.
The overall goal of this application, led by Prof Nelson Sewankambo at Makerere University is to implement
a sustainable advanced masters level education that provides in-depth understanding of international
research ethics in clinical, biomedical, behavioral and public health research, and enhances application of
research ethics principles in the East Africa. The program objectives that align with the three domains
mentioned above are:
1. To develop and sustain a two-year advanced Master of Health Science in Bioethics anchored on
 didactic course work and practicum experiences to produce graduates who are life-long learners, with
 in-depth knowledge and advanced skills that are scientifically and socio-culturally relevant to Uganda
 and international research ethics to provide research ethics leadership (in education, service provision,
 policy development, and conduct of applied and empirical research.
2. To develop and institutionalize a mentorship program in research ethics that facilitates development of
 bioethics professionals and health researchers who are committed to the growth and application of
 research ethics in Uganda’s academic and research institutions to the highest possible degree.
3. To accelerate the development of a Bioethics Center at Makerere University College of Health
 Sciences, that will serve as a coordination and innovations hub for the rapidly increasing and expanding
 ethics education (including continuing ethics education and mentorship to alumni), research,
 consultancy services, policy and related partnerships and networking activities at this research intense
institution.
This renewal application will lay a firm foundation for sustainability of model program for Uganda and the
Sub-Saharan region. Candidates for admission will be identified through a rigorous three-step process. A
Training and Advisory committee will be composed of leading researchers, bioethicists, educators and
policy makers from Makerere University. They will work closely with the implementation team to ensure
success of each trainee and the overall program. This process will lead to enhanced education, training
and professional development of its graduating bioethicists with potential to become research ethics
leaders and life-long learners. The students will each complete a mentored research project, disseminate
their results widely in the country and internationally including publishing in peer-reviewed journals. The
success of this program will translate into improvements in ethical decision making for research leading to
enhancements in responsible conduct of research, and overall protection of research participants."

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most prevalent acquired glomerular disease, affecting ~1 in 3 people with
diabetes. DN is characterized by a progressive proteinuric podocytopathy leading to 30-50% of the cases of
end stage kidney disease in the United States. Limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanism constrains
therapy to slowing the progression instead of preventing the pathogenesis of DN. Podocytes maintain the
glomerular filtration barrier by forming a molecular sieve called the slit diaphragm (SD). Mistrafficking of SD
proteins, which causes their dyshomeostasis is an early event in diabetic podocyte injury. There is a critical
need to define the early trafficking mechanisms underlying the diabetes-disturbed proteostasis in podocyte, to
identify targets that inform therapies to prevent rather than postpone the progression of DN. Our recent work
implicates a unique role of dynein as an energy-responsive motor protein complex that transduces diabetic
signals into disturbed trafficking and proteostasis in podocytes. Hyperglycemia can trigger the expression of
dynein subunits, apparently via a shared regulation by energy-responsive kinases and transcription factors
(TFs). Forceful transient overexpression of these hyperglycemia-responsive dynein subunits recapitulates the
features of diabetic podocytopathy. Our goal of this proposal is to dissect the targetable mechanisms of
dynein-mediated trafficking disturbance that compromise the function and viability of podocytes, to guide
development of therapies to prevent DN. Our central hypothesis is that dynein mediates an energy-responsive
trafficking that causes diabetic podocytopathy with dyshomeostasis of proteins important for podocyte function.
Furthermore, we posit that this pathology can be attenuated by targeting the metabolism-responsive regulators
of dynein expression or activation. The specific aims include: (1) Determine how diabetes enhances dynein
expression and activity underlying podocytopathy. By analyzing the posttranslational modifications of the TFs
and epigenetic modifications of dynein gene promoters in conjunction with ChIP and reporter gene assays, we
will test whether diabetes activates dynein expression via SP/KLF family TFs modified by energy responsive
kinases and whether dynein-mediated trafficking can be reversed by targeting the TFs and kinases. (2)
Elucidate how dynein-mediated trafficking disturbs podocyte proteostasis in diabetes. Using live cell and pulse
chase-based trafficking and degradation assays, we will test whether dynein has a key role in mediating the
energy-responsive changes in protein trafficking that disturb proteostasis. (3) Remodel dynein activity to see if
it mitigates podocytopathy in diabetic mouse models. Using a mouse model with podocyte-specific
overexpression of Dctn1 (a subunit required for dynein activation), we will test whether activating dynein
directly causes podocytopathy. Using a transgenic mouse model with a podocyte-specific knockout of Dctn1,
we will test whether targeting dynein-driven pathogenesis can attenuate diabetic podocytopathy. A detailed
understanding of dynein’s pathogenic role in DN will facilitate the development of new therapies to prevent DN."

The genetic abnormalities that drive tumorigenesis are usually coupled with epigenetic alterations such as
aberrant histone lysine methylations due to deregulation of histone methyltransferases and histone lysine
demethylases(KDMs). Our long-term goal is to investigate the mechanism by which oncogenic
transcription factors “hijack” KDMs in tumorigenesis and disease progression, and develop new therapies
to block the functions of these oncoproteins by targeting KDMs. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a
devastating soft tissue cancer in children and adolescent young adults. The alveolar RMS (aRMS) is a
more aggressive subtype, with a higher rate of metastasis. aRMS is primarily driven by the pathognomonic
fusion oncoprotein PAX3-FOXO1 or its variant PAX7-FOXO1 through chromosomal translocations of
t(2;13)(q35;q14) or t(1;13)(p36;q14). Despite the fact that current treatment modalities have steadily
improved survival of low-risk RMS patients, the outcome for the fusion positive aRMS patients with
metastasis remains dismal. Even for patients with favorable outcomes, the aggressive chemotherapy and
radiotherapy may lead to long-term adverse effects as children may be particularly vulnerable to long-term
toxicity. These clinical challenges underscore a pressing need to identify new therapeutic targets and
develop better therapies for these patients. However, one obstacle is much less is known about
vulnerabilities that arise in transformed cells by PAX3-FOXO1 that could be exploited therapeutically. In
this application, we will investigate the functional impact of KDM4 in tumorigenesis driven by PAX3-
FOXO1 (Aim 1); dissect the molecular mechanism of KDM4 inhibition on PAX3-FOXO1-driven aRMS (Aim
2), and translate KDM4 inhibitors into novel therapeutic approaches for PAX3-FOXO1 positive aRMS (Aim
3). This innovative study integrates multiple approaches to identify and validate new therapeutic targets
and explore small molecules to dually inhibit oncoproteins in the context of a disease that is driven by a
undruggable fusion oncoprotein. The proposed research will be impactful for its translational relevance for
the treatment of children with high-risk RMS and have the potential to shed new light on the molecular
mechanism of PAX3-FOXO1-driven aRMS."
